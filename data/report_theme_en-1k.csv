• OCHA Director of Operations, Mr. John Ging, visited Ethiopia to review the status of the Government-led international humanitarian response to drought and conflictaffected communities, including internally displaced people. 

• Humanitarian operators receive emergency logistics induction training to equip national emergency management authorities, staff from different agencies and humanitarian actors, with emergency logistics skills to ensure timely and efficient humanitarian response.

• Regional reports of the November-December national humanitarian needs assessment are currently being compiled. The humanitarian requirements for Ethiopia in 2018 will be determined once the compilation of all the regional reports is completed.

• Ethiopia continues to receive undocumented Ethiopian migrants repatriated from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 

**OCHA Director of Operations visited Ethiopia**

On 12-14 December 2017, Mr. John Ging, OCHA Director of Operations, visited Ethiopia to first-hand review the status of the Government-led international humanitarian response to drought and conflict-affected communities, including internally displaced people. The director met and discussed with the federal and regional Government of Ethiopia, donors, humanitarian agencies and communities affected by drought and conflict. Mr.Ging acknowledged the strong partnership the Government of Ethiopia has established over the years with the Humanitarian Country Team. He said that his visit is “a reflection of the importance of that partnership.”

The director visited Hamaressa IDP camp with over 4,000 people internally displaced by the Oromo-Somali inter-communal disputes. Following a briefing by the East Hararge zone administration about the scale of the crisis, Mr.Ging reassured authorities that he is committed to advocating for appropriate response to the crisis. The zonal authorities requested for urgent food and non-food assistance to IDPs East Hararge zone.  

Meanwhile subsequent intercommunal clashes were reported in West Hararge zone of Oromia region on the 12, 15 and 16 December resulting in more than 60 deaths. OCHA will continue to work with Government to verify access conditions and impact on humanitarian operations. Conflict has left close to 857,000 people displaced throughout the country.  

**Visit to Somali region**

During the meeting with the Somali Regional Government authorities, the region requested Mr.Ging’s advocacy support to scale up the ongoing response, particularly amidst the growing IDP needs and called for development investment in durable solutions for predictable pastoralist needs. The region also asked for the speedy implementation of cashbased assistance in all targeted woredas/districts. Mr. Ging and the Somali regional authorities discussed the need to improve accountability mechanisms, including quality needs assessment and information management.",4587,"Agriculture"
2392929,"Turkey Food Security and Agriculture Sector - Quarter 3 - 2017 For almost all refugee households in Turkey, the primary source of food remains market purchase. Food insecurity among refugees therefore results, principally, from an inability to access sufficient food, or the right foods, due to their lack of purchasing power.  

This considered, FSA actors in Turkey have sought to address food insecurity among refugees through e-voucher and other restricted cash programming. In this context, in the past quarter alone, monthly dedicated food assistance was extended to up to 152,000 refugees living in both Temporary Accommodation Centres (TACs) and host communities.  

During the reporting period, partners also focused on promoting agricultural livelihoods and by the end of September over 780 refugees and vulnerable members of host communities received trainings in modern agriculture technologies. Alongside the training, in 2018-19, some of the FSA sector partners are also assessing the needs and planning for providing agriculture inputs support; farm-to-market, value chain, and agribusiness support, and environmental protection and preservation measures to create new work and entrepreneurship opportunities in areas hosting large refugee populations.  

In the coming quarter, the FSA sector will conduct a survey to identify capacity building needs among sector partners, factoring results into the 2018 sector work plan. Plans are also in place to provide partners with technical assistance to strengthen homestead, micro-, and kitchen-garden projects.",4587,"Agriculture"
2392849,"New Agreement Signed to Support Climate Resilient Agriculture – over 500,000 Farmers to Benefit in Tamil Nadu NEW DELHI, December 26, 2017: The Government of India, the Government of Tamil Nadu and the World Bank today signed a $318 million loan agreement for the Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernization Project to promote climate resilient agriculture technologies, improve water management practices, and increase market opportunities for small and marginal farmers. About 500,000 farmers, of which a majority are small and marginal, are expected to benefit from improved and modernized tank irrigation systems.

The project will rehabilitate and modernize about 4,800 irrigation tanks and 477 check dams, spread across 66 sub-basins, in delivering bulk water to irrigation systems.

The agreement for the project was signed by Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; S K Prabhakar, Principal Secretary, Public Works Department, on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu and John Blomquist, Program Leader and Acting Country Director, World Bank, India on behalf of the World Bank.  

“This project will help Tamil Nadu scale up its efforts to unlock the full potential of its agriculture sector. It will support farmers improve the efficiency of water used in farming, diversify into high value crops, and produce crops that are resilient to the increasing threats of climate change. Such efforts will be a win-win for all, leading to better use of scarce water resources and raising household incomes of farmers,” said John Blomquist, Program Leader and Acting Country Director, World Bank, India.

Despite significant progress made during the past decade in crop diversification, its level in the state continues to remain low. Paddy is the dominant crop occupying 34 percent of total cropped areas, whereas fruits and vegetables are grown on 11 percent and pulses and oilseeds on 14 percent of total cropped areas. By helping farmers access modern technologies, linking them to markets, and providing postharvest management support, the project will enable farmers to shift from a mono crop paddy system to mixed cropping including high-value crops (fruits, vegetables, and spices), pulses, oilseeds, and millets.  

To enhance the ability of crops to withstand expected adverse impacts of climate change, the project will support smallholder producers adopt new conservation technologies such as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Sustainable Sugar Initiative (SSI). They reduce average water usage by 35 percent and increase yields by 22 percent per ha. The project is expected to increase the yield of rice, maize, and pulses by 18–20 percent. 

“The earlier World Bank-supported project on modernizing irrigated agriculture (TN IAMWARMP), had made significant impacts by modernizing irrigation infrastructure and improving the efficiency of water used for agriculture. This project will bring the policy and institutional developments achieved under the earlier project to a new level, improve farmers’ links to markets, and rehabilitate and modernize high-priority tank irrigation systems in more than 50 percent of the sub-basins of the state, which were not part of the TN IAMWARMP,” said Bayarsaikhan Tumurdavaa, Senior Agriculture Economist, and World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project.

The project will also coordinate with other World Bank-supported projects in Tamil Nadu and at the national level, including the Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project, National Hydrology Project, and National Groundwater Improvement Project to ensure synergy and enhance long-term project impact.

2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",4587,"Agriculture"

UNHCR livelihood programme supports refugees and asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, IDPs and host community to build their capabilities, facilitates access to productive assets (including social resources), and promotes access to employment. 

As of 30 November, UNHCR has provided livelihood opportunity to 8,306 persons to meet their basic needs and enjoy their social and economic rights. 

Attaining self-reliance for persons of concern is an important milestone. The sooner this is reached the faster the re-integration is attained.

**Achievements in 2017**

As of 30 November, UNHCR has provided livelihood opportunities to around 8,3061 persons in various livelihood programmes.

2,327 persons have been engaged in improvement of public infrastructure through cash-for-work (CfW) programme in beautifying a total of 18 districts, rehabilitating 13 schools, five community centres, three football stadiums, two health centres, two markets, an access road and a boat centre. The CfW programme provides short term employment (three to nine months) in addition to creating or rehabilitating public assets

Through technical and education vocation training (TEVT) 2,017 persons have been engaged in various classes: IT, tailoring, beauty salon, catering, mobile repair, handcrafting, mechanics, construction, fabric dying, bakery, air conditioner and refrigerator repair, fish preservation and fish drying, poultry production, agricultural production, solar power system, electrics and carpentry. TVST last from three to nine months during which person enhances his own capital, gained new skills and knowledge.

After graduation each beneficiary receives a start-up kit to start their own business. 2,174 beneficiaries were part of small-business programmes and have established their own business, such as: kiosks, grocery stores and butchers, retail shops, transport services, vegetable shops, restaurants and small trade companies.  

Another 1,788 persons were assisted with linkages to self-employment opportunities through various online platforms aimed at matching skills to needs.

The 2017 Deyr season nutrition assessment among Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the main settlements and two urban areas shows Critical prevalence of acute malnutrition (Global Acute Malnutrition-GAM ≥ 15%) in 5 out of 15 population groups surveyed in November: Qardho IDPs, Galkacyo IDPs, Garowe, Mogadishu IDPs and Baidoa IDPs - see Map 1 and Table 2.  

However, the nutrition situation among IDPs in Baidoa, Dhusmareeb Hargeisa and Berbera has shown statistically significant improvement since June 2017 (Gu season). The 2017 Deyr assessment results for IDPs in Mogadishu, Dolow and Bossaso also reflect decreases in GAM and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence since 2017 Gu although these changes are not statistically significant.  

**Assessment Overview** 

FSNAU and partners conducted joint Nutrition and Food security assessment among 15 population groups (13 IDP and two urban) across Somalia in November 2017 (Table 1). The objective of the assessments was to monitor the nutrition situation of IDPs in the 13 main IDP settlements and in selected urban areas (Mogadishu and Kismayo) as part of FSNAU’s biannual surveillance activities.  

A two-stage probability proportionate to size (PPS) cluster sampling protocol, based on SMART Methodology was used, with the exception of Qardho, Berbera and Dhusamareb IDP settlements where sampling was exhaustive. Retrospective mortality data for 136 days prior to the assessments was also collected among all sampled households. Mortality, food security and nutritional data was collected concurrently from the same households. Variables (anthropometric and all other contextual indicators) and mortality were entered using EPI info soft 3.5.4 and ENA SMART software (July 9th, 2015 version), respectively. For quality assurance, enumerators and supervisors received five days of training prior to data collection. During the field work, anthropometric dataset were checked on a daily basis using ENA SMART software plausibility parameters.  

GAM was estimated using World Health Organization growth standards, while Crude Death Rates (CDRs) and Under-Five Death Rates (U5DR) for children less than 5 years of age were calculated using the most recent population estimates available (UNDP PESS, 2014; CCCM DSA in Baidoa). The event used to calculate the recall period for the 2017 Deyr mortality assessment among IDP/urban populations was the beginning of Eidul Fitir religious holiday (i.e. 25 June 2017).

UNHCR together with government counterparts and partners continued providing assistance to Somali refugees who decided to voluntarily return home. To ensure sustainable reintegration of Somali refugee returnees, UNHCR provides the enhanced return package2 . Detailed achievements throughout November are presented below per sector.

**Protection and Return Support**

**Return Management**

■ The Government of Kenya have now authorized resumption of road convoys to Somalia but due to rainfalls in the region (Dhobley town, Lower Juba region), most of the return routes are not accessible, making return by road not feasible.

■ Flights to Kismayo have resumed on 21 November. The suspension was put in place on 28 September after the State of Jubaland imposed new landing fees on UN flights. The last return flight from Kenya to Kismayo was received on 28 September.

**Protection Monitoring**

■ UNHCR has shared the Country of Origin Information (COI) for the month of October with the Return Help Desk in Refugee Camps in Kenya and Yemen. The COI includes information about the humanitarian, security and political situation in Somalia. The COI helps Somali refugees make an informed decision about their return.

■ During November, the pilot phase of UNHCR’s new post-returns monitoring system commenced across South Central Somalia. Consultations were held with partners in Mogadishu before the rollout of the telephonic monitoring began. The new monitoring system includes a face-to-face survey.

**Return Figures**

Since the beginning of repatriation in 2014, a total of 109,317 Somalis returned to Somalia; 74,606 from Kenya, 34,077 from Yemen (33,667 spontaneous and 418 assisted) and 626 from other countries of asylum (589 from Djibouti, 34 from Eritrea, two from Tunisia, and one from Pakistan).

- Out of the 18 provinces in the country, 9 are classified as in Phase 2 according to the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) scale; Phase 2 is considered as “Alert” situation requiring monitoring and strengthening of resilience based on the IPC AMN scale.

- Of the nine provinces, 3 provinces (namely Karusi, Kayanza, and Kirundo) have relatively high levels of acute malnutrition levels which require particular attention.

- The major factors contributing to acute malnutrition include very poor quality of food, relatively high prevalence of diseases, and very poor sanitation.

- While the immediate response must focus on treating children with acute malnutrition, it is also vital to plan interventions to address the major contributing factors in order to reduce acute malnutrition levels.",4587,"Agriculture"
2391339,"Burundi: Acute Food Insecurity Situation October - December 2017 and January - May 2018 Based on the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) scale, 9 of the 18 provinces in Burundi are classified as in Phase 2 while the other provinces are categorised as being in Phase 1. According to the IPC AMN scale, Phase 2 indicates ‘Alert’ situation, which requires strengthening of existing response capacity and resilience and addressing of contributing factors to malnutrition as well as monitoring of the situation.

Of the nine provinces classified as being in “Alert” situation with regards to acute malnutrition, 3 provinces (namely Karusi, Kayanza, and Kirundo) have relatively high levels of acute malnutrition levels which require particular attention. It's worth to recall that at least 3 cases of Noma have been registered this year in Kirundo province.

Approximately about 125,000 children are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 9 of the 18 provinces alone in the country. Available data on the coverage of acute malnutrition treatment suggests that the coverage is not optimal.

Major contributing factors to acute malnutrition identified during the analysis are (1) very poor quality of food intake by children, (2) relatively high prevalence of diseases (particularly malaria), and (3) poor sanitation – see annex II for details on major contributing factors to acute malnutrition by province. It is noted that the quality of food intake by children is poor even in provinces where acute food insecurity is low. This suggests that it may be related to behaviour and/or lack of awareness of child feeding among caregivers. Poor quality of food in other provinces may likely be the result of both food insecurity as well as behaviour and lack of awareness. Several structural issues especially human, physical, and financial capital were also identified as major factors contributing to acute malnutrition in these areas. Anaemia is a major public health problem that calls for urgent attention in all provinces.

According to the IPC AMN projection analysis, the situation is likely to remain the same in all 9 provinces that are classified as Phase 2 during the upcoming rainy season (February-May 2018). However, slight deterioration in acute malnutrition levels are likely in some provinces because of seasonality and disease trends.

2391289,"Gaza Situation Report 213, 8 December – 19 December 2017 **HIGHLIGHTS**

- On 6 December, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres said following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that, “Jerusalem  is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides”.

- For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which has further undermined an already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 2017 in the context of disputes between the de-facto authorities in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely impacted the availability of essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and has undermined Gaza’s fragile economy, especially the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. In the already impoverished Gaza Strip, residents have learned to adapt to the fact that electricity is only available for between two and four hours a day. The shortages have defined how people live their lives: getting up in the middle of the night if there is power to run washing machines or turn on water pumps. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory, electricity blackouts in Gaza last between 19-21 hours each day. Families in Gaza are forced to spend a large part of their income on energy, whether on the meagre supply of electricity they receive through high voltage lines, or on the cost of fuel, generators and their repair.

- A ceremony to mark the International Day of Human Rights was organized by the UNRWA Field Education Programme at Beach Preparatory Girls School A in Beach camp, western Gaza city, on 11 December. The Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, and other senior UNRWA staff as well as teachers, students and their parents attended the event. The event included activities such as songs, sketches and a drawing competition for the students. The parents also participated in an activity where they shared their views on gender equality and non-discrimination in the Gaza Strip, wishing for a better future for all. For over ten years UNRWA has been integrating human rights, conflict resolution and tolerance in its school activities. In May 2012, the Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA. This policy builds upon past successes, but also draws from international best practices and paves the way to better integrate human rights education in all our schools.

- An online lecture with the Japanese Research Syowa Station in Antarctica was conducted via Skype to a group of 30 students from two UNRWA schools on 11 December 2017. Dr. Hirofumi Oe, the station’s medical doctor, introduced the life in Antarctica and the mission of the research station to the students. The lecture lasted for two hours and included a presentation with photos and videos followed by an open discussion during which the students raised a number of questions such as the impact of climate change on the world, and Antarctica in particular. Commenting on the lecture, Dr. Hirofumi expressed his pleasure in speaking with UNRWA students in Gaza, explaining the environment of Antarctica, and the purpose and activities of the Japanese research mission there. The lecture was a great opportunity to widen both the knowledge and horizon of students in Gaza. Freedom of movement outside Gaza is virtually non-existent due to the blockade; 90 per cent of the over 271,900 students from UNRWA schools have never left the Gaza Strip in their lives. The UNRWA Education Programme recognizes the critical need for students to understand and connect with the world, and hence always seeks to implement innovative projects through which refugee students can link to, and share knowledge and ideas with, their peers and others in the rest of the world.

- UNRWA in Gaza celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 4 December 2017. The ceremony took place at the UNRWA Gaza Field Office compound and was attended by UNRWA Director of Operations, Mr. Matthias Schmale, Chief of the Field Relief and Social Services Programme, Mr. Asem Abu Shawish, UNRWA senior staff as well as heads of community rehabilitation centres that provide support to persons with disabilities across the Gaza Strip. The ceremony included speeches by Mr. Schmale, representatives from the coordination committee of the community rehabilitation centres, and a representative of persons with disabilities. It also included many uplifting performances by children with disabilities. The disability sub-programme of the UNRWA Relief and Social Services Programme provides various forms of support to people with disabilities and assists vulnerable groups of Palestine refugees through community social interventions. It conducts activities through 19 Community-Based Organizations, 7 Women’s Programme Centres, 7 Community-Based Rehabilitation Centres for persons with disabilities and 5 Youth Activity Centres.

- During the reporting period, as part of his regular outreach visits, the Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, visited Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, and Gaza City. During the visit to Khan Younis camp, the Director met with a beneficiary family receiving Social Safety Net support due to their extreme poverty and visited UNRWA Abu Teama Preparatory Co-ed school. In his visit to Gaza city, Mr. Schmale met with members of the School Parliament and their teachers at the UNRWA Gaza Preparatory Girls A, and then proceeded to Tuffah Distribution Centre, a Community-Based Rehabilitation Centre and the Sheikh Radwan Health Centre. The visit was followed by a meeting with UNRWA Health Programme senior staff in which the Chief of the Field Health Programme, Dr. Ghada Al-Jadba, highlighted the programme’s achievements and challenges in 2017.

**OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT**

On 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 and 17 December, Palestinian civilians, staged protests near the perimeter fence in different areas of Gaza against the American president’s decision to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. When some of them approached the fence and threw stones towards Israeli observation posts, Israeli forces responded with gunfire and teargas. Two deaths and 258 injuries were reported.

On 7, 8, 9, 14 and 18 December, Israeli Forces fired missiles targeting militant training locations across the Gaza Strip in response to mortar shells fired by militants. Two deaths and 16 injuries were reported.

**UNRWA’S RESPONSE**

**THE UNRWA JOB CREATION PROGRAMME: PROVIDING A SOURCE OF INCOME AND STRENGTHENING SELF-RELIANCE**

The blockade of Gaza entered its 11th year in June 2017. The heavy restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza , in addition to the three consecutive conflicts and the internal political divide, have not only crushed the enclave’s formerly trade-based economy, they are also heavily responsible for the sky-rocketing unemployment rates. Extreme poverty, food insecurity and confinement contribute to depression, and hopelessness. According to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in Gaza was at 46.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.Even more dramatically, 71 per cent of females in Gaza are reportedly unemployed.
Through the UNRWA Job Creation Programme (JCP), the Agency works to mitigate the impact of the collapsed economy and labour market in Gaza by providing livelihood opportunities for Palestine refugees.

41-year-old Palestine refugee Enshirah Al-Batah, who lives with her nine-member family in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza Strip, received a three-month work opportunity as a labourer in an agriculture project in Beit Lahia as part of UNRWA’s JCP activities.

“I applied for a position in the UNRWA Job Creation Programme seven years ago. I felt blessed and happy when UNRWA called to inform me that I got a three-month job opportunity. Every morning I go to work with my colleagues and start my work with hope and passion. We pick and package strawberries and prepare them for possible export,” Enshirah said.

The programme targets both skilled and unskilled workers as well as professionals. Priority is given to applicants from households who have been assessed as living below the poverty line of less than US$ 3.87 per person per day; other criteria are gender, age, skills, or location. UNRWA aims to provide 40 per cent of skilled opportunities to women and 40 per cent of all job opportunities to youth. UNRWA also offers thousands of opportunities for graduates from Gaza universities through its Graduate Training Programme.

“This is my first paid job ever. Due to my family’s difficult economic conditions, I received little education. I can hardly read and write so it’s not easy to find a job. At the beginning, it was hard to adapt with the new routine, but now I can’t wait until morning comes to see my friends. I feel more confident and productive,” Enshirah added.

The Job Creation Programme provides not only a source of income, but also helps to restore self-respect, dignity and some form of self-reliance to thousands of Palestine refugees. The money earned through short-term job opportunities is mostly spent to cover basic needs such as medicine, fresh food, or clothes.

“I use the money I gain to repay my family debts and pay for my daughter’s college tuition. My dreams and hopes are simple. I dream of having a stable source of income,” Enshirah added.

In the first nine months of 2017, UNRWA created job opportunities for 16,515 beneficiaries, injecting US$ 12.4 million into the Gaza economy. To address high levels of youth unemployment in Gaza, a sub-component of the JCP – the Graduate Training Programme – offered 2,799 (out of the total of 16,515 jobs) opportunities to recent graduates in 2017 to date.

**FUNDING NEEDS**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget in 2017. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

Following the 2014 conflict, US$ 316 million has been pledged in support of UNRWA’s emergency shelter programme, for which an estimated US$ 720 million is required. This leaves a current shortfall of US$ 404 million. UNRWA urgently appeals to donors to generously contribute to its emergency shelter programme to provide displaced Palestine refugees in Gaza with rental subsidies or cash assistance to undertake reconstruction of their demolished homes.

As presented in UNRWA’s occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) Emergency Appeal for 2017, the Agency is seeking US$ 402 million to meet the minimum humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees in the oPt. The Gaza portion of the Emergency Appeal amounts to US$ 355 million for 2017, to address protracted, large scale humanitarian needs. More information can be found [here](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/emergency-appeals/opt-emergency-appeal-2017).

**CROSSINGS**

Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have undermined the living conditions of 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, Erez crossing and Kerem Shalom crossing. Rafah crossing is controlled by the Egyptian authorities and technically allows for the movement of a number of authorized travelers, Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases only. Erez crossing is controlled by Israeli authorities and technically allows for the movement of aid workers and limited numbers of authorized travelers, including Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases. Kerem Shalom crossing, also controlled by Israeli authorities, technically allows for the movement of authorized goods only.",4587,"Agriculture"
2391249,"Strengthening farmer organizations as agents of peace in Colombia A new project of ICCO Cooperation in Colombia has been approved for signing by the European Union’s Trust Fund. In the project, farmer organizations will be strengthened as central agents in the construction of peace.

The project will be carried out in the framework of the implementation of the peace accord, signed in November of 2016 between the Colombian government and the FARC. One of the proposals in this accord is to improve the economic conditions in the country and dignify the living conditions of the rural population, which are fundamental steps towards achieving a peace. This project will contribute to that.

**Target groups**

The project aims at benefiting 2,500 people (youths, women, producers and ethnic and farmer communities), 12 producer and farmer organizations and 12 businesses in the agricultural sector.

A specific target group are smallholders, as improving the living conditions of the rural populations is an important step in the peace process. Furthermore, business initiatives of youths will be supported in the sectors of tourism, gastronomy and hospitality. The project will also promote the participation of women, indigenous and peasant communities in the formulation of the Plans for Development, led by the national government of Colombia.

**Agribusiness Booster**

Together with [AgriBusiness Booster](https://www.icco-cooperation.org/en/Expertise/Agribusiness-Booster), ICCO will co-entrepreneur in the project with small and medium-sized businesses which will be linked to the agricultural chain. Therefore an investment fund will be created for agro-productive initiatives. At the end of the project, the fund will be sustained by ICCO and Agribusiness Booster.

**Consortium**

The project will be implemented by a consortium led by ICCO with the participation of Agribusiness Booster, CETEC, PAX, JUSTAPAZ, Renacer, UNIPA and the National Platform of Rural Women, in alliance with the ministries of agriculture and local governments.

2391214,"GIEWS Country Brief: Lesotho 20-December-2017 **FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT**

- Dry conditions during planting period of 2018 cereal crops

- However, rainfall prospects generally favourable for remainder of current 2017/18 season

- Maize production in 2017 estimated at well aboveaverage level

- Ample cereal supplies result in reduced import requirements for 2017/18 marketing year and increased stock levels

- Food security conditions improved significantly, mostly on account of increased agricultural output

**Dry conditions at start of 2017/18 cropping season**

Land preparation and planting for the 2018 cereal crops is underway and is expected to be finalized by the end of the year. Abnormal dry conditions were observed during most of September and November, resulting in below-average vegetation conditions in cropped areas in the main cereal-producing northern regions. However, heavier rains were recorded at the beginning of December and meteorological forecasts point to a higher likelihood of above-average rainfall in the first quarter of 2018. Should the favourable rains materialize, the current moisture deficits are expected to be reversed with a positive effect on 2018 production prospects.

**Production rebounded strongly in 2017**

Based on the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics’ agricultural assessment, cereal production in 2017 is estimated at a well above-average level of 238 000 tonnes, a significant increase compared to the drought-reduced level of 2016. Most of this increase reflects a sharp upturn in maize production, estimated at 200 000 tonnes. In addition, there was a sharp increase for sorghum production, while the wheat output is estimated at an average level, but still well above the previous year’s output.

**Import requirements drop in 2017/18**

As a result of the bumper 2017 output, cereal import requirements are estimated at a well below-average level of 177 000 tonnes in the 2017/18 marketing year (April/March). Of this amount, imports of maize would account for 65 000 tonnes.

In addition, given the favourable supply situation, stock levels are forecast to rise sharply in 2017/18 to near average levels.

**Decreased number of food insecure**

The food security situation has improved markedly in 2017/18 compared to the previous year where an estimated 709 000 people required food assistance. Based on the latest 2017 Lesotho Vulnerability Assessment Committee’s (LVACs) evaluation, the number of food insecure people in 2017/18 is estimated at about 225 000. The year-on-year decline is mostly attributed to the upturn in this year’s agricultural output.",4587,"Agriculture"

**Working with Partners** 

■ Together with the DRC Government, and in particular the National Commission for Refugees (CNR), UNHCR manages and implements delivery of humanitarian assistance and protection for refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Through a collaborative approach, support is delivered jointly with FAO, IOM, MONUSCO, OCHA, UNDP, UNFPA, UN-HABITAT, UNICEF, UNWOMEN, WFP and WHO among other agencies and NGOs. UNHCR leads the Protection Cluster, which coordinates the protection actors in their support to IDPs and other civilians. It also supports the coordination and management of IDP camps. Furthermore, UNHCR coleads the Protection and Prevention component of the National Strategy on Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in DRC. Throughout the operational area, assistance is delivered together with 12 partners: ADES, ADSSE, AIDES, AIRD, CNR, COOPI, INTERSOS, MIDEFEHOPF, SAVE CONGO, SAVE THE CHILDREN, SFCG and TSF.

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)).

2390669,"Central America Hashes Out Agenda for Sustainable Use of Water By [Edgardo Ayala](http://www.ipsnews.net/author/edgardo-ayala/)

SAN SALVADOR, Dec 21 2017 (IPS) - The countries of Central America are striving to define a plan to promote the sustainable use of water, a crucial need in a region that is already suffering the impacts of climate change.

This effort has materialised in Central America’s Water Agenda, the draft of which was agreed in November, in Tegucigalpa, by the governments of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, along with the Spanish-speaking Caribbean nation the Dominican Republic.

These countries form part of the Central American Integration System (SICA), the economic and political organisation of Central American countries, since December 1991, where they are working to address the issue of water with a regional and sustainable perspective.

The document is expected to be approved at a regional meeting to be held in February in Santo Domingo, according to Central American officials and experts interviewed by IPS.

“We saw that it was convenient for us to work on a plan, a sort of agenda, that would give expression to the issue of the integral management of the resource,” Salvador Nieto, executive director of the Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD), told IPS.

This is the SICA agency made up of the environment ministers of the eight countries, focused on coordinating efforts to collectively preserve the region’s ecosystems.

And water is a vitally important issue for the 50.6 million Central Americans, especially farmers who have lost their crops due to a lack or excess of rainfall, as a result of climate change.

“All the studies recognise the vulnerability of the region, and point out that the most severe impacts of climate change for Central America will be because of the water issue,” Nieto added.

He said that although reports show that there will be intense storms, they also warn that in the medium term the main problem will be a shortage of water throughout the region.

In 2014, drought caused some 650 million dollars in losses in agriculture, hydroelectric power generation and drinking water, according to the study Situation of Water Resources in Central America: Towards Integrated Management, published in March by the Global Water Partnership (GWP).

However, the region has good water availability, because Central American countries use less than 10 percent of their available resources, points out the August edition of Entre-aguas, a report by the regional office of the GWP, an international network of organisations involved in the question of the management of water resources.

The problem, the report says, is the irregular temporal and geographical distribution of precipitation, and the scarce mechanisms of water storage and regulation.

That limits an optimal and efficient use of water, which leads to basins with problems of water scarcity in the dry season.

The GWP report adds that, due to the high climate variability associated with climate change, the concentration of rainfall in certain regions or in certain periods and droughts in others, affects the quantity and quality of water available.

In 2014, 17 percent of Central America’s total population, some 7.8 million people, did not have drinking water in their homes, according to the World Bank.

In this sense, the Agenda seeks to ensure water availability for present and future generations, but also to establish actions to face extreme climate events.

This situation in Central America, a region constantly affected by climate phenomena, convinced the political elites to take action not only in their countries, but at a regional level.

The GWP has been working with the CCAD to promote the strengthening of governance of water resources in Central America.

“In the region there has been no political instrument to establish a common agenda on water issues, which is why this effort has been made: to generate a space for coordination among the environment ministers, who are responsible for the management of water,” Tábora said, from the GWP regional office in Tegucigalpa.

The Agenda emerges from the effort to establish integrated management of water resources, one of the objectives contained in the CCAD Regional Environmental Framework Strategy, approved in February 2015 by the environment ministers of the region.

This integrated management, from which the Agenda arises, contemplates addressing key areas, such as the promotion of governance systems for the sustainable use of water, which involves actions, for example, to generate and share data and experiences regarding the problems involving water.

“The development of knowledge about water resources is through research, monitoring, or establishing measuring stations and sharing information, a recurrent need in all the countries of Central America,” José Miguel Zeledón, water director in Costa Rica’s Environment and Energy Ministry, told IPS.

He stressed that “we have to make progress in assessing the water situation, because our countries lack information, in order to know what water resources we have, what state they are in and how we can distribute them.”

Another strategic area is the development of instruments for the integrated management of international water bodies, which involves the promotion of a political dialogue at the highest level on protocols, agreements or successful model agreements on the subject.

“The implementation of the Agenda would bring benefits because many communities with water problems are in shared or transboundary basins, and that is why a main focus is to work on the question of international water bodies,” Silvia Larios, an expert on water in El Salvador’s Environment Ministry, told IPS.

Of the river basins in Central America, 23 are transboundary, covering approximately 191,449 square km (37 percent of the Central American territory), and the region has 18 transboundary aquifer systems, according to the GWP.

The GWP also emphasises the importance of promoting technology exchange, as there are communities that cannot be supplied with traditional systems, or cannot properly manage their wastewater, but will have to look for other technical options.

Larios stressed that the Agenda seeks both to reduce conflicts over the use of water resources and to guarantee availability. She also recognises access to water as a human right, to guarantee the supply to communities.

The GWP’s Tábora said that Central America has made progress in water coverage and infrastructure development, but that there is still a gap between rural and urban areas.

“Rural areas continue to be but on the back burner,” she said. Of Central America’s total population, 58 percent lives in urban areas, according to the GWP study.

Also, added Tábora, water quality has been neglected, both in cities and in rural areas.

Addressing the challenges related to water, she said, necessitates an understanding that solutions have inherent political actions, such as the enactment of water laws, given that the resource is linked to economic interests.

To set the Agenda into motion, its operational plan has yet to be implemented, alliances have to be built with various organisations and its funding must be organised and managed by the regional cooperation mechanisms.",4587,"Agriculture"
2390409,"FAO Rice Market Monitor, December 2017, Volume XX - Issue No. 4 **ROUND UP** 

Since the October issue of the RMM, FAO has raised its forecast of world paddy production in 2017 by 2.1 million tonnes to 756.7 million tonnes (502.2 million tonnes, milled basis). The revisions primarily mirrors improved crop prospects for China (Mainland) and Myanmar, although Pakistan, the Philippines, Sierra Leone are all predicted to gather more than reported in October.  
Combined, these changes more than offset various downward revisions, the largest of which concerning Bangladesh and Madagascar.  

At the revised level of 756.7 million tonnes, global paddy production would surpass the 2016 all-time high by a small margin of 0.2 percent. From a regional perspective, the comparatively stable outlook mirrors prospects of only modest output growth in Asia, where uneven rainfall patterns look set to temper area expansions promoted by continued state assistance and positive margins. Put together, countries in Asia are seen producing 684.2 million tonnes in 2017, up 1.4 million tonnes from the 2016 record. The largest absolute expansions in the region are expected to take place in China (Mainland), Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, but Cambodia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Timor Leste are all set to gather larger crops. The outlook is more subdued elsewhere, especially for South Asian producers that experienced a series of weather setbacks. This was namely the case of Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka and, to a lesser extent, India. Afghanistan, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Turkey and Viet Nam are all similarly set to face production declines this season.  

FAO’s outlook continues to point to 2017 production in Africa exceeding the 2016 all-time high by 1 percent to reach 31.1 million tonnes. Generally favorable precipitation levels through September permitted producers in most West African countries to react to attractive prices and government assistance programs by expanding plantings. Prospects are also positive for Egypt, more than compensating for contractions in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Niger and, especially Madagascar and the United Republic of Tanzania, where crops were impaired by erratic rains.",4587,"Agriculture"
2390354,"Special Report: FAO/WFP Crop and Livestock Assessment Mission to Mongolia **Mission Highlights**

- A severe drought in mid-2017 gravely affected large agricultural producing areas and pasture rangelands.

- The 2017 production of wheat, the country's main staple food, is forecast at 231 000 tonnes, almost half of last year’s high level and more than 40 percent lower than the average of the previous five years. The impact on other crops, including potatoes, barley, oats and buckwheat, was also severe.

- Reduced pastureland resulted in below-average livestock body conditions. The impact on livestock is further compounded by the drought-reduced hay and fodder availability, which is estimated at 53 million tonnes, the lowest level since 2007. These conditions raise serious concerns over the occurrence of a dzud1 event in the winter/spring months.

- In October, prices of meat products were well below their levels a year earlier, mainly due to increased herders’ sales on fears of animal losses during the winter/spring months and the need of buying hay to sustain remaining animals.

- Wheat import requirements in the 2017/18 marketing year (October/September) are forecast at about 230 000 tonnes, considerably above the five-year average. It is expected that required imports will be fully covered by commercial purchases.

- With the decrease in crop production, many farmers were unable to repay debts and have reduced hiring of seasonal labour - eliminating the primary income source for the season for many wage labour households.

- Poor pasture land conditions have forced herders to find alternative fodder sources by traveling long distances to collect hay and/or procuring hay at higher than usual prices.

- With reduced meat prices, herders must decide between selling at a lower than normal price or maintaining their animals through the winter.

- Access to credit is crucial for many households in the winter and spring when incomes are reduced.  
Herder households with less than 200 animals do not have sufficient collateral to receive a loan.

- Previous dzud events have led to loss of livelihoods and mass migration to urban ger districts where infrastructure, public services are limited, and poverty and food insecurity rates are high, particularly in the winter and spring.

**1. OVERVIEW** 

An FAO/WFP Crop and Livestock Assessment Mission visited Mongolia from 15 to 28 October 2017, prompted by the prolonged drought from mid-May to end-July that sharply reduced the 2017 crop output and depleted rangeland conditions, raising serious concerns over the impact on the livestock ahead of the winter/spring period. 

The Mission estimated the impact of the dry weather on the 2017 wheat, potatoes and vegetable production and forecast the expected wheat deficit for 2017/18 marketing year (October/September). The Mission assessed also the impact of the dry weather on hay production and fodder supplies for the livestock sector for the forthcoming winter/spring months, up to April 2018. Furthermore, the mission assessed the impact of the drought on households, their coping strategies and contingency plans in view of the coming winter. 

The Mission visited seven of Mongolia’s 21 provinces in Khangai and Central regions. The team was composed by three international staff from FAO/WFP and national agricultural officers. 

Prior to departing to the field, the Mission was briefed on current crop production and livestock performance as well as general macroeconomic context by several national and international institutions and obtained national and province-wise data on precipitation, crop production and livestock numbers, prices, inputs availability and trade. Institutions visited were the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry (MoFALI), the Parliament House, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the National Statistics Office (NSO), the Meat Producers Association, the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour (MSWL). 

The Mission obtained MoFALI data at provincial and district level of crop harvested area, yield and production estimates. During the field work, obtained data was cross-checked against information provided by farmers, including smallholders and large scale wheat producers, and against Vegetation Health Index (VHI) images, estimated rainfall and other remotely sensed meteorological data provided by FAO/GIEWS. Visits to food markets with interviews with traders were also conducted. The Mission conducted structured interviews with a number of herders and farmers to assess the impact of the drought and analyse households’ winter preparedness and coping strategies ahead of the winter/spring.  

In 2017, a prolonged period of severe dry weather between mid-May and end of July, intensified by extreme high temperatures in June, damaged large swatches of cropped areas and caused a severe deterioration of pastures and rangeland conditions. An estimated 80 percent of the country was affected by drought conditions. This resulted in severe yield and area losses of the 2017 crops, including wheat, potatoes, barley, oats and buckwheat. The 2017 wheat production is estimated at about 231 000 tonnes, almost half of last year’s high level and over 40 percent less than the five-year average. Similarly, potatoes output is estimated at about 117 000 tonnes, 23 percent less than in 2016 and 36 percent below the previous five-year average.  

The wheat import requirements in 2017/18 marketing year are forecast at about 230 000 tonnes, considerably above the five-year average and close to the 2015/16 level, when imports reached 215 000 tonnes in response to a drought-reduced wheat output. Imports are expected to be fully covered by commercial purchases.  

Drought also caused a severe deterioration of pasture conditions, which prevented livestock to gain fat stores and strengthen core muscle strength, critical to overcome the normally harsh winter/spring months. According to MoFALI data, as of November 2017, overall livestock body condition is 14 percent below average. Body conditions were reported to be particularly poor in Khangai and Central regions’ provinces. Drought-reduced hay and fodder availabilities, coupled with weak livestock conditions, rise serious concerns over the impact of the winter/spring months on livestock and livelihoods.  

Retail prices of wheat flour have remained stable in recent months, but are expected to increase in early 2018 due to reduced availability of wheat grains following the 2017 severely reduced output. In October, prices of meat products were reportedly lower than a year earlier, due to poor livestock body conditions and increase of distressed sales of animals in most markets. Most herders have decided to sell larger amounts of livestock, even at lower prices, ahead of further deterioration of their body conditions and high probability of increased mortality during winter/spring months. By contrast, prices of dairy products are reportedly higher than in 2016, mainly due to reduced animal productivity due to drought.  

The reduced crop production resulted in widespread indebtedness of farmers, who were forced to drastically reduce the use of seasonal wage labour. As a consequence, the loss of wage labour opportunities left a significant number of households who live in wheat producing areas with reduced employment and limited alternative sources of income.  

Harsh winters following summer droughts significantly increase risks for herders to lose their animals. As past events have demonstrated, the loss of livestock assets is likely to determine large migration movements into urban areas in search for economic support. Migratory groups often settle in suburban areas of capital city Ulaanbaatar, known as ger, where there are virtually no infrastructures and public services, and face food security issues, particularly during the winter periods.",4587,"Agriculture"
2390229,"WFP Nigeria Situation Report #23, 1-30 November 2017 **Highlights**

- In November WFP, both directly and through partnerships, provided food assistance to 1,160,000 people (97 percent of the plan of the month) through in-kind distributions (75 percent) and cash-based transfers (25 percent) in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.

- The onset of the dry season triggered an increase in attacks and renewed military operations in November, particularly in Borno State and parts of Adamawa State. This has caused additional population displacement, substantial casualties, and restricted humanitarian access.

**Situation Update**

- An increase in the number of security incidents is being reported. Non-State Armed Group (NSAG) carried out suicide attacks in Mubi and Madagali towns (Adamawa State), and Magumeri town (Borno State). The Secretary-General strongly condemned the suicide attacks in Mubi, the deadliest this year, and expressed particular concerns as several humanitarian organisations have established their presence in this town to better access vulnerable people in Adamawa.

- Harvests concluded at the end of November across the country. FEWSNET reports that countrywide the cereal production is 9 percent higher than last year and the impact of the harvests combined with other improving macroeconomic indicators has produced a decline in food prices countrywide.

- Although the aggregate production of cereals has been above average across the country, the December FEWSNET and WFP joint market monitoring bulletin reported that the prices of food commodities monitored across the markets in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States have increased compared to last year, as the conflict has affected the local harvest.

- The joint market monitoring bulletin also reported that recent recovery in oil export revenues, coupled with relatively stable inflation, is helping to gradually drive Nigeria’s economy out of recession.

- The food security situation in Northeast Nigeria remains extremely fragile and although the risk of famine has so far been averted, in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe 2.56 million people are currently in need of food assistance.

- Without maintained and even expanded humanitarian food and livelihood assistance, 3.7 million people will be estimated to be at risk of critical food insecurity in the next lean season, June to August 2008.

- Across the three states an estimated 560,000 children 6 to 59 months are acutely malnourished - 310,000 children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and 251,000 with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Further, an estimated 230,000 pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished.

- The IOM-DTM reports from January to October 2017 (Rounds XIV to XIX) indicate that food assistance remains a priority need for displaced households particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.

- During the month sectors and humanitarian partners, including WFP, have been carrying in-depth joint needs assessments in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States whose findings are to feed into the Humanitarian Needs Overview and the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, both to be finalised by mid-December.

- Across the border, tensions increased in Cameroon between the government and Anglophone minority and the dry season has allowed thousands of Englishspeaking Cameroonians to begin fleeing across the border into Nigeria Cross River State via four entry points with Cameroon. UNHCR is currently providing food and non-food items (NFIs) to the 5,277 already registered asylum seekers.

- Taking into consideration the potential deterioration of the situation WFP, UNHCR and partners have elaborated a contingency plan and a technical coordination meeting will be held with government authorities in Cross-River state on 18 December.",4587,"Agriculture"
2389799,"Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in the Near East and North Africa **Conflict causing spikes in food insecurity in the Near East and North Africa**

*Strife and violence in some countries are casting a shadow on prospects for Zero Hunger across the entire region*

21 December 2017, Cairo/Rome – Conflict and protracted crises in a handful of countries in the Near East and North Africa are hamstringing efforts to eradicate hunger in the region by 2030, according to a new FAO report published today.

The 2017 edition of the Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) highlights in particular how an ongoing intensification of violence is opening a wide ""hunger gap"" between countries being affected by conflicts and those that are not.

In NENA countries directly impacted by conflict, 27.2 percent of all people were chronically hungry – or undernourished – during the 2014-16 period. That's six times higher than the share of the population that was undernourished in countries not affected by strife (4.6 percent, on average). Meanwhile, ""severe food insecurity"" – another metric used by FAO to measure hunger – in conflict-affected countries now is double that in non-conflict countries.

These trends are casting a dark shadow on the broader NENA region's ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger by 2030, today's report warns. (Full list of NENA countries below)

In a region largely made up of developing, middle-income countries – where chronic hunger typically affects less than 5 percent of their populations – violence in an unfortunate few has seen the proportion of chronically hungry people in conflict zones shoot up to levels comparable with the world's poorest countries, which is exercising a strong drag effect on hunger reduction in the full NENA area.

This will make realistic progress towards eradicating hunger in the region using traditional tools of policymaking difficult, unless decisive steps towards peace and stability are taken, the report cautions.

**Hot spots**

The report highlights several NENA countries being particularly affected by conflict, with profound consequences for people's incomes and food security.

In Syria, violence has provoked a 67 percent reduction in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and severely undermined food security – from 70 to 80 percent of Syrians now need humanitarian assistance, while 50 percent require food assistance.

In Iraq, where violence has led to for 58 percent decline in GDP, 30 percent of the population needs humanitarian assistance while 9 percent requires food assistance.

Yemen is also being wracked by conflict, leading to a situation in which 70 to 80 of the population are in need humanitarian assistance and 50 percent require food assistance.

Libya is another hot spot where conflict is undermining food security; there, 6 percent of the population are in need of food assistance, according to the report.

**Building resilience in trying times**

Speaking at the report's Cairo launch, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative, Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, highlighted the pivotal importance of building resilience and sustaining peace in the Near East and North Africa region to improving peoples' well-being.

He pointed to ""the growing need to implement long-term and comprehensive policies and practices to achieve Zero hunger by 2030,"" adding that that ""when countries in the region are suffering from an escalation of conflicts, the aim to tackle the region's deepest concerns of malnutrition, water scarcity and climate change becomes more challenging but at the same time more urgent"".

""Only through improved cooperation and solidarity will the region be able to end conflicts and violence and get back to development,"" Ould Ahmed concluded.

Today's report establishes a baseline for measuring future progress towards achieving SDG 2 in the NENA region using the latest indicators for the SDG targets on hunger and food insecurity (Target 2.1) and malnutrition (Target 2.2).

The report also identifies how conflict itself encumbers SDG monitoring. UN agencies gather and assess information on food security and nutrition status during conflict, but the data are not always complete and can be difficult to compare with peacetime data.

Beyond statistics, the report focuses on the fundamental factors that have driven improvements in food security and malnutrition: poverty reduction, economic growth, improvements in maternal and childhood nutrition and public health, increases in the quantity and quality of food and the cessation of violence.

Note to editors: NENA countries include Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.",4587,"Agriculture"
2389439,"Zimbabwe Food Security Outlook Update, December 2017 **Below normal rains received across the bulk of the country during the first half of the season**

KEY MESSAGES 

• Most northern and typical cereal-surplus areas continue to experience Minimal (IPC Phase 1) food security outcomes which are expected through March 2018 and for the remainder of the outlook period. However, typical cereal-deficit areas in the southern, western, and extreme northern regions are currently Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) due to low or depleted ownproduced food stocks and limited livelihood activities. Some areas are being targeted for humanitarian assistance, but only during the period of January to March 2018 will the level of assistance in a few districts improve outcomes to Stressed (IPC Phase 2!).

• Below normal cumulative rainfall has been received across the bulk of the country since the start of the 2017-18 rainfall season in October and November. The worst affected province is Mashonaland West, one of the highest surplus-producing areas in the country. Planted area is lower than typical in most areas and agricultural activity is below-normal as well.

• Maize grain supplies in local markets is unusually good across most parts of the country, so the typical pattern of the movement of grain from surplus areas in the north to deficit areas in the south is not occurring. Maize grain prices continue to be atypically stable and below average, but due to poor livelihoods and cash shortages, the majority of poor households are still not able to access maize grain.",4587,"Agriculture"
2389429,"Tambura Displacement Brief: Tambura County, Western Equatoria State, South Sudan, November 2017 **Background**

Following reports of returnee influx from the Central African Republic (CAR) to bordering areas in Western Equatoria State, REACH deployed as part of a multi-agency assessment to Tambura town, the border town of Source Yubu and surrounding areas to understand displacement patterns and access to services for newly arrived internally displaced person (IDP) and local communities. Tambura town was assessed on 8 November and Source Yubu was assessed on 9 November. REACH conducted five focus group discussions (FGDs) with newly arrived IDPs and members of the local community and two key informant interviews with Relief Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) officials. Eight settlements were furthermore assessed remotely through Key Informant (KI) interviews.

**Population Movement and Displacement**

The population of Tambura County has reportedly rapidly increased since the beginning of the year with reported influx of returnees from CAR as well as IDPs from neighbouring counties.

**Returns from CAR**

Since June 2017, high numbers of South Sudanese refugees started to come back from Obo Camp in southeastern CAR. The RRC recorded 6,212 returnees (1,517 households (HHs)) in Source Yubu and 16,699 IDPs/returnees (8,360 HHs) in Tambura,2 though no humanitarian organizations have been able to verify these numbers.  

The main challenge along the traveling route reported by the returning population was hunger. While able-bodied individuals reportedly took between 5 to 9 days to travel from Obo Camp to Source Yubu and another 3 to 5 days to reach Tambura town, those traveling with young children took much longer, often several weeks.  

FGD participants reported that the returns were primarily motivated by a lack of food inside the camp, where food distributions stopped around June due to insecurity along the supply route.3 Refugees in Obo Camp were reportedly not allowed to access land for cultivation and were therefore completely dependent on food assistance. Another reported reason for return was the fear of conflict, which is currently affecting CAR.

FGD participants reported that Obo Camp mainly hosted refugees from Source Yubu, which fled South Sudan following conflict which began in 2015. The most recent clashes in Source Yubu took place around November 2016 when most of the population was displaced to Bambouti, a town located approximately 5 km west of the border inside of CAR, from where they were transferred to Obo Camp earlier in the year. Other refugees in Obo Camp were reportedly from Ezo,  
Tambura and Nagero Counties, suggesting that small numbers of refugees might also be returning to those areas.

The vast majority of the returnees are originally from Source Yubu.  
Some of the returnees were able to settle again in their former communities in Source Yubu. A substantial proportion, however, reportedly found their houses destroyed or occupied by armed actors upon return and decided to move on towards Tambura town.  
Returnees/IDPs are scattered in and around Tambura town where they have settled with the local communities.

**Displacement from Bazia Road, Wau County**

Between February and April 2017, heavy clashes displaced populations living along the Bazia road in Western Bahr el Ghazal towards Jur River County and Farajallah village, Wau County. A smaller number reportedly fled south to Nagero and Tambura Counties. According to recent reports, 700 IDPs have settled in Nagero town,5 while the RRC in Tambura town recorded another 300 HHs which reportedly arrived between February and May 2017.

**Displacement from Nadiangare village, Yambio County**

According to the RRC in Tambura town, approximately, 1,980 IDPs (325 HHs) have reportedly arrived between December 2016 and February 2017 from Nadiangare Village in Yambio County. Most of these IDPs have reportedly settled 10 km outside of Tambura town in Seneguse settlement (Mupoi Payam), after initial displacement from Nadiangare village due to heavy clashes.

**Displacement from Ezo town, Ezo County**

Frequent clashes between 2015 and 2017 displaced people from Ezo town and outskirts towards Tambura town and surroundings, while others fled across the border to refugee camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There are no official estimate numbers of IDPs from Ezo. However, FGD participants estimated around 2,000-3,000 individuals, some of whom have reportedly returned to Ezo town and surroundings.

**Refugees from Central African Republic**

Reports shared by the Refugee Commission Affairs of 119 newly arrived refugees (22 HHs) from CAR could not be confirmed during the mission to Tambura. The RRC had reportedly no information about recent arrivals and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) could only verify nine newly arrived refugees from CAR. UNHCR had registered 812 refugees (250 HHs) that had fled intensive conflict between 2009 and 2012. Those refugees have settled within the Tambura community and were therefore reportedly not interested in relocation to refugee camps.",4587,"Agriculture"
2389424,"Food Security Early Warning System - Agromet Update, Issue 2: 2017/2018 Agricultural Season **Highlights**

- Good rains were received in the northern half of the region.
- Low rainfall in the southern half of the region led to delays in planting and crop moisture stress in some areas.
- Vegetation conditions deteriorated in southern and eastern parts of the region.
- A fall armyworm outbreak has affected 20 out of 28 districts in Malawi.

**Regional Summary**

Northern parts of the region received good rainfall since October, and most areas had normal to above normal cumulative rainfall totals as of mid-December 2017 (Figure 1, green colours). Areas where above normal rains were received include the north-eastern half of Angola, much of DRC, north Zambia, northern Mozambique, northern and central Madagascar, and much of Tanzania.  
In contrast, most places in the southern half of the region received below average rainfall since October 2017 (yellow and brown colours, Figure 1). These areas include southern Angola, most of Botswana and Namibia, south-western and central South Africa, Lesotho, southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, Zimbabwe, and south-western Madagascar. Some bimodal areas in the north-eastern parts of Tanzania also received well below average rainfall. November was particularly dry in many of these areas, while southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, and Zimbabwe received low rainfall in the first half of December. 

Despite the low rainfall in the southern half of the region, most areas had experienced an onset of rains by early December (Figure 2). In a few areas where the seasonal rains have not yet started, the delay in onset ranges from approximately 20 to 30 days (grey colours, Figure 2).  

Areas affected include south-western Angola, parts of southern and central Mozambique, parts of northern Namibia, and southern South Africa. A prolonged delay in the onset of rains can negatively affect crop yields by reducing the number of days available for crop development, and crops can fail to reach maturity before the end of the growing season. Most areas where the season has already started experienced a timely onset of rains, except for parts of Lesotho, South Africa, DRC and Zimbabwe, where the onset was delayed by as much as 30 to 40 days. Due to the generally timely onset, farmers in many areas have started planting, with reports of crops being in the initial to early vegetative stage in some areas.  

However, in some of the areas that received below average rainfall in November through early December, particularly southern Mozambique, southern Zambia and Zimbabwe, crops have been affected by insufficient moisture, with reports that some farmers have not yet planted. In cases where planting has already occurred in the above-mentioned areas, some crops are reported to be experiencing moisture stress due to the prevailing dry conditions.  

As a result of the dry spell, vegetation conditions have deteriorated in many areas. The satellite vegetation index image (Figure 3) shows that many parts of the region had below average vegetation conditions (yellow and brown colours, Figure 3) by the first dekad of December.  
Reports from Namibia indicate that the poor rainfall has led to a deterioration of grazing conditions in several parts of the country. As a consequence, livestock are reported to be in poor to fair body condition in parts of the country, although livestock in other areas were reported to be in fair to good condition.  

SADC Climate Services Centre, in conjunction with national meteorological agencies from the region, in December issued an updated seasonal rainfall forecast for the Jan-to-Mar, Feb-to-Apr, and Mar-to-May 2017 periods for the SADC region. The forecast update maintained a higher likelihood for normal rainfall in all parts of the region, with a potential tendency for above normal rainfall in most areas. Among countries that updated their forecasts for January to March, Botswana and Zimbabwe reduced their expectations for above normal rainfall. Botswana’s revised forecast predicts normal to above normal rainfall in most areas except for eastern Botswana where normal rainfall is expected, while Zimbabwe expects normal rainfall throughout the country for the January-March period. Users are advised to contact their respective national meteorological agencies for forecast updates and interpretation.  

Given the poor rains that have been received in the southern half of the region to date, well distributed rains will be required for the remainder of the season in order to avert negative climatic impacts on agriculture. A continuation of good rains in the northern half as forecast will raise the potential for good production in those areas. The latest forecasts, which are generally presenting reduced chances for above normal rainfall in some southern parts of the region, imply the need for farming methods that promote conservation of soil moisture and reduce the risk of severe crop moisture stress due to dry spells that can potentially occur, especially in the climatologically drier areas. These methods include mulching and minimum tillage, amongst others.  

Interventions to promote the availability of functional irrigation equipment where possible are also important, as they can reduce the potential impact of dry spells in areas where they normally occur.  
A fall armyworm (FAW) outbreak occurred in Malawi in December, affecting 20 out of 28 districts in the country, and close to 140,000 farming households. These districts have been declared as disaster areas by the President of Malawi. The presence of the FAW was also reported for the first time in Madagascar in October 2017. This brings to 13 the number of countries in the SADC region where the FAW presence has been reported since 2016 – Mauritius and Lesotho are the only countries in the region where the pest has not been observed and reported. Crop pest experts from Africa and around the world have held several meetings in the region to provide situational updates and facilitate preparedness and coordination among stakeholders. The experts have recommended that the FAW needs to be managed using integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, as an effective, safe and sustainable response to the food security threat posed by the pest.",4587,"Agriculture"

2389234,"Chad: Socioeconomic profiling of Sudanese, Central African et Nigerian refugees **1- Background and rationale**

Chad has been welcoming Sudanese refugees fleeing violence in the Darfur region for more than 10 years. Security and political conditions are still not conducive to a return to their home country.  
At the same time, overall insecurity prevails in Central African Republic impeding the repatriation of thousands of C.A.R. refugees and returnees living in Southern Chad. The prolonged presence of refugees in Chad and the continuous reduction in available funding for food and non-food assistance, have led the humanitarian community to reconsider the type of interventions in place. Between 2014 and 2015, WFP and UNHCR conducted a socio-economic categorization in refugee camps in Southern and South-eastern parts of the country with the strong involvement of CNARR (Government agency for refugees and returnees). Based on lessons learned from that approach, the 2016 Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) recommended an update in 2017. The current exercise was designed to go beyond a simple categorization and thus identify refugee household that can be empowered in the short to medium term as well as factors that can enable self-reliance. The results of profiling should be used to develop a new strategic needs-based approach. During the exercise, the technical teams decided to include in the analysis Nigerian and Central Africans refugees who arrived more recently but who may eventually face the same difficulties. 

**2- Key figures**

- Initial data collection was conducted between 17 June and 15 July 2017. An additional round for Central African refugees installed in host villages in southern Chad was organized from 25 July to 4 August 2017.

- 544 officers including 435 interviewers ensured data collection; supervision and data quality check was provided by the staff of CNARR, UNHCR and WFP;.

- 19 camps and 9 host villages were visited by data collection teams.

- 87,725 households were interviewed using the socio-economic questionnaire.

- 18 checklists were filled with programme officers, cooperating partners, local authorities and managers of basic services in camps.

Heavy fighting in north-eastern Hama governorate continued in November, triggering population displacement into the Idleb countryside. Following the recapture of Ar-Raqqa, an estimated 20,000 people have returned to three districts of Ar Raqqa city, however, basic services such as water, electricity and communications remain largely unavailable.  

The intensification of the five-year siege on Eastern Ghouta has significantly undermined food security. A survey conducted by UNICEF in November in areas of Eastern Ghouta indicated that the proportion of children under 5 suffering from acute malnutrition has risen from 2.1 percent in January 2017 to 11.9 percent in November 2017. This is the highest rate of child acute malnutrition recorded in Syria since the beginning of the conflict.  

WFP conducted a joint rapid food security and market assessment in the Duma sub-district of Eastern Ghouta, where a majority of its 175,000 residents, are in need of humanitarian assistance. Supply routes into Eastern Ghouta were completely closed-off for three months (since September 2017) causing food prices to increase dramatically. By mid-November, the price of bread (a daily staple) had increased to 85 times the price for the same commodity in Damascus just 15 kilometres away.

2387499,"Helping build sustainably productive farming systems through the work of the Asian Cassava Breeders, and Forage Legumes, Networks *by Madelline Romero*

Researchers from eight Asian countries – Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam – gathered on December 12-13, 2017 in Haikou City, China, to form the Asian Forage Legumes Network.

This is in response to the increasing pressure for farming systems in Asia to produce more without causing further harm to the environment.

“As soils deteriorate and become unable to provide the nitrogen that crops need, crops tend to look for other ways to obtain nitrogen,” explains Didier Lesueur, soil scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). “This is why nitrogen-fixation from the atmosphere is very important in agriculture. And the most important nitrogen-fixing agents in agricultural systems are the symbiotic – mutually beneficial – associations between crop, forage legumes, and rhizobia – the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that camp inside the root nodules of legumes.”

In addition to fixing atmospheric nitrogen (N), intercropped legumes contribute to enhancing soil carbon content through the leaves and root systems that remain in the field after harvest. When used as green manure, multipurpose legumes help in mitigation of soil erosion by providing a better soil cover. Beyond facilitating soil health, when used as forages, legumes provide high-quality livestock feed, thereby helping increase livestock production. These are some of the benefits of the integration of multipurpose legumes in farming systems. For scientists at CIAT, this is one way to sustainably diversify tropical crop-livestock systems in Asia.

“We would like for farmers to take advantage of the many benefits derived from nitrogen fixed in crop-livestock systems,” notes Sabine Douxchamps, integrated farming systems researcher at CIAT. “And we need to be able to answer a number of questions, like what are the economic benefits to a farmer, how much savings in fertilizer will it effect, and others, to encourage farmers to adopt certain farming practices.”

**Building a Forage Legumes Network in Asia**

The network looked into the current level of knowledge on biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by forage legumes in Asian farming systems. In the end, the group of researchers identified several broad research subjects deemed critical to understanding and promoting biological nitrogen fixation within the region.

As members of the Asian Forage Legumes Network, the researchers have committed to collaborate on research studies, as well as on a number of initiatives, including the identification and conservation of forage legume species that are tolerant to stresses such as those caused by salinity, drought, waterlogging, and acidity. Others are the establishment of a forage legumes rhizobia bank, testing of some commercial rhizobia inoculants, and development of quality control guidelines to ensure high-quality inoculants.

“In tropical areas like the parts of China that suffer from acidity, nutrient loss, and degradation, soil research is very important,” said Prof. Changjun Bai, Director of the Tropical Pasture Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS), the meeting host. “For the benefit of smallholders, it is important to pursue collaborative research projects.”

To this end, CIAT is brokering regional cooperation in agricultural science and technology by helping establish research platforms among Asian countries, jointly facilitated by CIAT and China.

**Asian Cassava Breeders Network**

An economically significant crop for many countries in Asia, cassava is one such research subject that has attracted collaboration among researchers in the region. A week before the meeting in Haikou City, researchers from CIAT, China, and a host of other research institutions and programs, met at the Kasetsart University in Thailand for the third annual meeting of the Asian Cassava Breeders Network (ACB-Net).

ACB-Net is a regional community of practice that brings together cassava breeders and other interested stakeholders for a systematic collaboration on cassava genetic enhancement and crop improvement. Established in 2015, the network includes classical breeding programs and molecular breeding laboratories, as well as public and civil society organizations interested in evaluating cassava varieties. Currently, some 28 organizations from the research, public, and private sectors, in 10 Asian countries, form membership of the network.

At the meeting, researchers shared updates on each their institution’s work on cassava breeding . They also discussed actions to address the issue of cassava mosaic disease (CMD), a disease caused by a virus and transmitted by whiteflies, and which causes cassava plants to produce few or no tubers at all. In Africa, yield losses induced by cassava mosaic virus (CMV) in different countries had ranged from 20 to 95 percent, at one point.

The disease’s presence was discovered in Cambodia in 2015. Since then researchers from CIAT and CATAS have been actively collaborating on regional surveillance together with partners in Cambodia and Vietnam. Results of the 2016 regional surveillance will be published in a peer reviewed publication, while a new round of regional sampling in 2018 will be coordinated by CIAT and CATAS.

“The fast pace of CMD spread is a huge concern for cassava production in mainland Southeast Asia,” said Stef de Haan, researcher at CIAT and member of the ACB-Net steering committee. “CIAT has already introduced sources of resistance to Thailand and Vietnam. ACB-Net will collaborate to further introduce additional breeding populations with resistance, from CCTRI in India and IITA in Africa. Incorporating resistance genes into breeding programs and testing the materials under intentional field-level exposure will require active collaboration between regional breeding programs. The network will allow for this international collaboration to take shape.”

Beyond CMD-resistance breeding, other activities that the network has in place for 2018 include capacity building events for young breeders; introduction and regional distribution of germplasm, including of elite progenitors; publication of standard procedures; and development of projects to address regional priorities.",4587,"Agriculture"
2387334,"2017 Africa Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition (Building Resilience for Food Security and Nutrition in Times of Conflict and Crisis: A Perspective from the Near East and North Africa Region) **Strife and violence in some countries are casting a shadow on prospects for Zero Hunger across the entire region**

21 December 2017, Cairo/Rome – Conflict and protracted crises in a handful of countries in the Near East and North Africa are hamstringing efforts to eradicate hunger in the region by 2030, according to a new FAO report published today.

The 2017 edition of the Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) highlights in particular how an ongoing intensification of violence is opening a wide ""hunger gap"" between countries being affected by conflicts and those that are not.

In NENA countries directly impacted by conflict, 27.2 percent of all people were chronically hungry – or undernourished – during the 2014-16 period. That's six times higher than the share of the population that was undernourished in countries not affected by strife (4.6 percent, on average). Meanwhile, ""severe food insecurity"" –  another metric used by FAO to measure hunger – in conflict-affected countries   now is double that in non-conflict countries.

These trends are casting a dark shadow on the broader NENA region's ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger by 2030, today's report warns.

In a region largely made up of developing, middle-income countries – where chronic hunger typically affects less than 5 percent of their populations – violence in an unfortunate few has seen the proportion of chronically hungry people in conflict zones shoot up to levels comparable with the world's poorest   countries, which is exercising a strong drag effect on hunger reduction in the full NENA area.

This will make realistic progress towards eradicating hunger in the region using traditional tools of policymaking difficult, unless decisive steps towards peace and stability are taken, the report cautions.

**Hot spots**

The report highlights several NENA countries being particularly affected by conflict, with profound consequences for people's incomes and food security.

In Syria, violence has provoked a 67 percent reduction in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and severely undermined food security – from 70 to 80 percent of Syrians now need humanitarian assistance, while 50 percent require food assistance.

In Iraq, where violence has led to for 58 percent decline in GDP, 30 percent of the population needs humanitarian assistance while 9 percent requires food assistance.

Yemen is also being wracked by conflict, leading to a situation in which 70 to 80 of the population are in need humanitarian assistance and 50 percent require food assistance.

Libya is another hot spot where conflict is undermining food security; there, 6 percent of the population are in need of food assistance, according to the report.

Building resilience in trying times

Speaking at the report's Cairo launch, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative, Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, highlighted the pivotal importance of building resilience and sustaining peace in the Near East and North Africa region to improving peoples' well-being.

He pointed to ""the growing need to implement long-term and comprehensive policies and practices to achieve Zero hunger by 2030,"" adding that that ""when countries in the region are suffering from an escalation of conflicts, the aim to tackle the region's deepest concerns of malnutrition, water scarcity and climate change becomes more challenging but at the same time more urgent"".

""Only through improved cooperation and solidarity will the region be able to end conflicts and violence and get back to development,"" Ould Ahmed concluded.

Today's report establishes a baseline for measuring future progress towards achieving SDG 2 in the NENA region using the latest indicators for the SDG targets on hunger and food insecurity (Target 2.1) and malnutrition (Target 2.2).

The report also identifies how conflict itself encumbers SDG monitoring. UN agencies gather and assess information on food security and nutrition status during conflict, but the data are not always complete and can be difficult to compare with peacetime data.

Beyond statistics, the report focuses on the fundamental factors that have driven improvements in food security and malnutrition: poverty reduction, economic growth, improvements in maternal and childhood nutrition and public health, increases in the quantity and quality of food and the cessation of violence.",4587,"Agriculture"

**137 dengue fever cases reported across Sudan**

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) in Sudan has recently reported an increase in the number of suspected dengue fever cases during the period 2 October to 8 December 2017.

A total of 137 suspected cases, including three deaths, were reported from Khartoum, Kassala, East and West Darfur, South Kordofan, Red Sea, River Nile and Gezira states over this period. The highest number of cases (118 suspected cases with no associated deaths) was reported in Kassala, likely related to strong case detection and management capacity by the State Ministry of Health (SMoH). Out of 49 blood samples taken from Kassala and Khartoum, 40 tested positive for Dengue (39 from Kassala, 1 from Khartoum).

In response, FMoH, SMoH and WHO activated the response plan, including by distributing mosquito repellents to 10,000 school children in Kassala and volunteers, and visiting 2,500 houses to raise awareness about indoor vector control activities. In order to contain the current suspected outbreak in the country, the FMoH has actively worked to strengthen surveillance for early detection of suspected cases as well as strengthen entomological surveillance and vector control measures. Additionally, partners have agreed on standardized case definition and the distribution of guidelines and protocols. Risk communication should play a major role in the community to increase awareness about protective measures needed to reduce exposure to mosquito bites.

The last outbreak of dengue fever in Sudan was reported in 2014 in Red Sea State, with 738 cases reported, including six associated deaths. Red Sea State has been affected by dengue fever since 2003. The worst outbreak in Sudan, so far, was in 2010, with 4,008 cases and 12 deaths reported, according to the WHO’s most recent Epidemiological Monitor.

Dengue fever is transmitted through the bite of infected the female Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same species that transmits yellow fever. With similar symptoms to malaria, such as febrile conditions, and head ache, characteristic of dengue fever is a skin rash and lethargy. Generally lasting seven days, it manifests after a 14-day incubation period after the mosquito bite. It affects infants, young children and adults, and seldom causes death, but may evolve in a small sample of cases to a life-threatening haemorrhagic fever. Recovery from infection provides lifelong immunity against the virus.",4587,"Agriculture"

- Overall, South Sudanese households are facing the worst food security situation since the Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS) began in 2010.
- More than three-fourths (76 percent) of the households across the country are facing moderate to severe food insecurity. This is higher than the 67 percent reported from the FSNMS survey conducted in December 2016 and also the 71 percent during the lean season (June) of 2016. 80 percent of the households recorded below acceptable food consumption scores, of which 54 percent had poor consumption and 26 percent had borderline consumption. Considering the household hunger scale, 79 percent of the households experienced moderate to severe hunger (66 percent moderate and 13 percent severe) up from 68 percent (65 percent moderate and 3 percent severe) at the same time one year ago.
- Food insecurity has spread out of traditional areas of Great Upper Nile region. High food insecurity levels are also observed in the Equatorias region, once considered the bread basket of the country, with a significant deterioration from the same period in the last year, an indication of the impact of prevailing insecurity in this region, and consequent disruption of livelihoods.
- Overall, households are spending almost two thirds (64 percent) of their monthly expenditures on food, higher than the same period last year (57 percent), showing a decrease in their purchasing power and their ability to procure essential non-food items and services  
- Households have been facing challenges in sustaining income through their livelihoods. Some 90 percent of the respondents reported their income had either reduced or remained the same compared to one year ago. This has an adverse impact on household purchasing power and consequent food security at a time when food prices have continued to rise exorbitantly.

2386849,"Zambia staple maize market fundamentals (October 2017) **Executive Summary**

- The objective of this report is to document the basic market context for staple food production and marketing in Zambia with a focus on maize, the country’s key commodity.

- The information presented stems from a literature review, secondary data, and a field assessment. Incountry research took place in October 2014 and included market visits and a three-day stakeholder consultation workshop held in Lusaka.

- Zambia’s economy is largely dependent on its mining industry, especially the export of copper. Following a period of rapid growth, the country’s economic growth rate fell in 2013 and remains sluggish, driven by a drop in international copper prices. The subsequent decline in revenue from copper exports also led to currency depreciation and inflation in recent years.

- Zambia’s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown steadily since 2001, with a growth rate remaining above 5 percent for most of the past decade. However, the agriculture sector’s contribution to GDP declined from 16.0 percent in 2001 to 12.6 percent in 2012. Although agriculture is not the main driver of the Zambian economy, it is the most important sector for employment and supports the livelihood of over 66 percent of the population (Tembo and Sitko 2013).

- Despite economic growth, poverty rates remain high (over 60 percent of the population is poor), especially in rural areas.  
While Zambia’s political environment is relatively stable and calm, electricity, transport, and storage infrastructure drawbacks continue to limit the country’s ability to improve living standards across all socioeconomic levels of the population.

- Maize, cassava, wheat, rice,sweet potatoes, groundnuts, and mixed beans represent the main food staples in the country in terms of area planted and production volume. Higher-value, commercial cash crops such as cotton, tobacco, and sugar are also produced and are among Zambia’s main agricultural exports (Esterhuizen 2015).

- On aggregate, Zambia is surplus in terms of domestic food availability. Most food production in Zambia takes place at the smallholder and subsistence level, with low use of agricultural inputs, and in rainfed conditions. The presence of one rainy season provides one main harvest for predominantly rainfed crops, including maize. For these type of products, seasonality plays a major role in food availability and trade, while other heavily irrigated food crops, such rice and wheat, can be and are harvested and marketed throughout the year, depending mostly on stocks, import levels, and prices.  
Finally, cassava, while also rainfed, can be harvested throughout the year due to the crop’s growth cycle and resilience.  
Cassava is harvested depending on household food needs and is mostly consumed within the household and not marketed.

- Besides production-related aspects, several other factors influence the performance of agricultural markets due to their impact on food availability, access, and/or trade. In broad terms, these factors are:

 - Geographic/climatic: the unimodal rainfall pattern leaves the country vulnerable to long-term supply implications from the annual harvest. Weather irregularities can therefore have very significant effects on the supply level for the entire following marketing year, as well as subsequent years.

 - Physical: insufficient and inadequate infrastructure, mostly roads, irrigation systems, and storage facilities impede the staple food value chain growth and functionality at various levels, from productivity to distribution.

 - Institutional: substantial government intervention in the agriculture sector (purchase of staple foods, subsidized sales of staple foods on the market, input subsidies, and extension services) serves as a source of demand for some producers and affects prices in the markets. High public spending on these programs is a heavy financial burden on the national agriculture budget. 

 - Political economy environment: uncertainty in trade policies (including export bans), as well as in the domestic public market interventions (including timing and price levels of purchases and sales of maize on markets), creates disincentives, volatility, and biases within the food markets.

- Regional context: structural deficiency in neighboring deficit countries, surplus levels in other East and Southern African regional exporter countries, price differentials, trade policies, and regional integration to a large degree dictate the magnitude and direction of flows of staple foods between countries.

- Zambia is second only to South Africa as the main staple food exporter and source of regional food supply and trade.  
Staple foods are exported to neighboring structurally deficit countries (mostly Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)). Factors affecting production and overall supply in the broader region impact production and trade dynamics in Zambia. In addition, regional integration mechanisms (such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)) facilitate the access of Zambian goods in the regional market.

- White maize, the nation’s most produced and consumed staple food, is produced mostly in Eastern, Central, and Southern Provinces and is exported formally and informally to several countries in the region. White maize is consumed across the country fresh or as dried (grain, flour) product, and is also used for the brewing of local drinks. The maize value chain is very complex and involves multiple actors, both private and public, large- and small-scale, formal and informal.  
The public sector is a big market actor and is involved in both purchasing and selling on the market, as well as setting trade policy. Zambia both became and sustained its role as an important source of maize for the Southern Africa region in the past decade.",4587,"Agriculture"

2386424,"Nigeria: Cash suitability assessment for food assistance in Konduga (December 2017) **Summary**

Following eight years of conflict in Northeast Nigeria, the region is experiencing significant humanitarian needs. In Borno State, the area most heavily affected by the crisis, 1.37 million people were internally displaced as of the start of 2017,1 and 30% of the population reportedly faced critical food insecurity situations as of October 2017.2 In response to this food security crisis, humanitarian actors have sought to provide vulnerable populations with food assistance through both in-kind food distributions and cash-based food assistance.  

It is within this context that the Nigeria Food Security Sector approached REACH to conduct an assessment in order to determine the most appropriate food assistance modality in the town of Konduga, the capital of Konduga Local Government Area (LGA) in Borno State. As Sector members intended to provide food assistance to the entire population of the town, which they estimated to be approximately 60,000, the assessment targeted both internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host populations.  

This assessment was carried out in close collaboration with operational partners that have recently been involved in the provision of food aid to Konduga Town, and was coordinated through the Food Security Sector. The assessment used a mixed methodology, gathering primary data from a number of sources. A total of 447 household surveys were conducted in Konduga Town, with the population divided into the following four groups based on settlement type for the purposes of random sampling: 1) IDPs in camps (109 surveys); 2) IDPs living in the host community (99 surveys); 3) Households living in informal sites (105 surveys); 4) Host population including returnees (134 surveys).3 The households surveys had a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 10% within each sampled population group, and had a 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error when aggregated to the level of the overall town population. The household surveys focused on food assistance modality preferences, reasons for those preferences, and access to food, markets, cash, and in-kind distributions.

Furthermore, 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with households (one men’s and one women’s FGD for each of the four population groups, along with one men’s and one women’s FGD for IDPs who had arrived within the past month), as well as 16 interviews with Bulamas (traditional community leaders) about their food assistance modality preferences for their communities. In addition, 49 food vendors in Konduga Town were interviewed, primarily on security and non-security challenges to conducting business, how they were supplied, the process of transporting goods to Konduga, and their estimated volumes of trade. These interviews were complemented by 3 FGDs with vendors, 2 interviews with heads of traders, and 3 interviews with Maiduguri-based suppliers of food vendors in Konduga.  

Findings from this assessment apply only to food assistance in the town of Konduga and cannot be generalised to other parts of Konduga LGA, other towns or areas outside the LGA, or to non-food aid.",4587,"Agriculture"

2386119,"Mali: Food Assistance Fact Sheet -  December 19, 2017 **Situation**

- Recurrent natural disasters, limited job opportunities and severe poverty contribute to chronic malnutrition and hunger in Mali, with civil conflict since 2012 exacerbating food insecurity and spurring population displacement in the north. As of late 2017, the Government of Mali (GoM) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that there were approximately 40,700 internally displaced persons within Mali and 134,100 Malian refugees residing in neighboring countries. Overall, nearly 44 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line, according to the World Bank. Preliminary results from a national nutrition survey, conducted by the GoM and UN agencies in mid-2017, found that almost 11 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition. In Timbuktu and Gao regions, the malnutrition level exceeded 15 percent, the UN World Health Organization’s emergency threshold.

- The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report that farmers are currently harvesting their crops across the country, with yields projected to be significantly higher than the five-year average. FEWS NET anticipates that most households in Mali will face Minimal (IPC 1) food insecurity through May 2018. However, food security conditions in some regions, including the Western Sahel, the Inner Niger Delta and pastoral areas of Timbuktu and Gao regions, will likely decline to Stressed (IPC 2) levels of food insecurity between March and May as cereal prices increase and households deplete their food stocks. A recent Cadre Harmonisé (CH) report—a tool used in West Africa for the classification and quantification of food insecurity—also projected that 795,000 Malians will likely face Crisis (Phase 3) or worse levels of food insecurity between June and August 2018, a period which includes pastoral and agricultural lean seasons.*

\* The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a standardized tool that aims to classify the severity and magnitude of food insecurity. The IPC scale, comparable across countries, ranges from Minimal (IPC 1) to Famine (IPC 5). The CH, a similar tool used only in West Africa, has a separate scale ranging from Minimal (Phase 1) to Famine (Phase 5).

**Response**

- In Mali, USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) works with the UN World Food Program (WFP) to respond to urgent food needs though general food distributions, blanket and targeted supplementary feeding programs and food-for-assets activities. FFP also facilitates WFP’s local and regional purchase of food and delivery of food vouchers to stimulate local production and markets. Through the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), FFP provides ready-to-use therapeutic food to treat severely malnourished children.

- With support from FFP, non-governmental organization (NGO) partners provide cash transfers and food vouchers to vulnerable Malians to both improve household access to food and spur market recovery. These partners are also helping to restore community infrastructure and diversify livelihoods. 

- FFP partners with NGO CARE to implement a five-year, $45 million development program to benefit more than 300,000 individuals in the Mopti region.

Activities focus on health and nutrition promotion, prevention and treatment of malnutrition, livelihood diversification and increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation.",4587,"Agriculture"
2392849,"New Agreement Signed to Support Climate Resilient Agriculture – over 500,000 Farmers to Benefit in Tamil Nadu NEW DELHI, December 26, 2017: The Government of India, the Government of Tamil Nadu and the World Bank today signed a $318 million loan agreement for the Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernization Project to promote climate resilient agriculture technologies, improve water management practices, and increase market opportunities for small and marginal farmers. About 500,000 farmers, of which a majority are small and marginal, are expected to benefit from improved and modernized tank irrigation systems.

The project will rehabilitate and modernize about 4,800 irrigation tanks and 477 check dams, spread across 66 sub-basins, in delivering bulk water to irrigation systems.

The agreement for the project was signed by Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; S K Prabhakar, Principal Secretary, Public Works Department, on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu and John Blomquist, Program Leader and Acting Country Director, World Bank, India on behalf of the World Bank.  

“This project will help Tamil Nadu scale up its efforts to unlock the full potential of its agriculture sector. It will support farmers improve the efficiency of water used in farming, diversify into high value crops, and produce crops that are resilient to the increasing threats of climate change. Such efforts will be a win-win for all, leading to better use of scarce water resources and raising household incomes of farmers,” said John Blomquist, Program Leader and Acting Country Director, World Bank, India.

Despite significant progress made during the past decade in crop diversification, its level in the state continues to remain low. Paddy is the dominant crop occupying 34 percent of total cropped areas, whereas fruits and vegetables are grown on 11 percent and pulses and oilseeds on 14 percent of total cropped areas. By helping farmers access modern technologies, linking them to markets, and providing postharvest management support, the project will enable farmers to shift from a mono crop paddy system to mixed cropping including high-value crops (fruits, vegetables, and spices), pulses, oilseeds, and millets.  

To enhance the ability of crops to withstand expected adverse impacts of climate change, the project will support smallholder producers adopt new conservation technologies such as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Sustainable Sugar Initiative (SSI). They reduce average water usage by 35 percent and increase yields by 22 percent per ha. The project is expected to increase the yield of rice, maize, and pulses by 18–20 percent. 

“The earlier World Bank-supported project on modernizing irrigated agriculture (TN IAMWARMP), had made significant impacts by modernizing irrigation infrastructure and improving the efficiency of water used for agriculture. This project will bring the policy and institutional developments achieved under the earlier project to a new level, improve farmers’ links to markets, and rehabilitate and modernize high-priority tank irrigation systems in more than 50 percent of the sub-basins of the state, which were not part of the TN IAMWARMP,” said Bayarsaikhan Tumurdavaa, Senior Agriculture Economist, and World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project.

The project will also coordinate with other World Bank-supported projects in Tamil Nadu and at the national level, including the Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project, National Hydrology Project, and National Groundwater Improvement Project to ensure synergy and enhance long-term project impact.

2391274,"Homegrown African climate model predicts future rains - and risks by Munyaradzi Makoni | Thomson Reuters Foundation  
Friday, 22 December 2017 18:44 GMT

**As African try to adapt to changing conditions, climate information specific to the continent is key, scientists say**

CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Dec 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - One big problem confronts Africa as it tries to predict how its weather patterns will shift in the face of climate change: Almost all the climate models for the continent were created in the United States or Europe.

Now South African climate researcher Francois Engelbrecht has changed that by developing a climate model for Africa, in Africa.

The model aims to ""generate reliable projections of future climate change over Africa,"" said Engelbrecht, the chief researcher for climate studies, modeling and environmental health at South Africa's [Council for Scientific and Industrial Research](https://www.csir.co.za/).

Those projections include figuring out which areas will get more or less rainfall – a key to adapting agriculture successfully – or looking at where African grasslands might give way to thickets as more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere drives the growth of trees.

""We know that climate is changing, risks are changing, including changes in the risk of heatwaves, flooding, drought, tropical cyclones, changes in growing seasons (and) rising temperatures,"" said Rachel James, a visiting climate researcher at the University of Cape Town.

""People everywhere will need to adapt to these changing conditions in the years and decades to come,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""The problem is that we don't know exactly what will happen in any one location. It's challenging to predict which areas might get more rainfall and which might get less.""

MORE DETAIL

The new African-built climate model aims to generate much more detailed and place-specific projections, to give decision makers the information they need to prepare for coming changes.

It responds, in part, to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noting in 2014 that Africa was the only region of the world in which climate forecasts had not improved in recent years.

Developed in collaboration with Australia, the model will look at things such as how El Nino patterns are likely to affect Africa in the future and how African monsoons may shift, Engelbrecht said.

Africa has a lot of expertise on its ecosystems, regional oceans, and climate, but this knowledge has not been built into models up to now, he said.

Models developed by northern hemisphere countries have tended to focus more on areas of northern interest, such as the Arctic, where sea ice is fast disappearing, he said.

And global models that include Africa generally are not specific enough to be helpful on the ground in a particular country or region, said Neville Sweijd, head of the South Africa-based [Alliance for Collaboration on Climate and Earth Systems Science](https://www.access.ac.za/).

""All models are not complete representations of reality and have to be tested for sensitivity to various features and phenomena,"" he said, including the direction of winds.

James noted that ""climates in Africa are particularly challenging to model"" because of the influence of local events such as key thunderstorms, ""which occur on finer scales than the models can resolve,"" she said.

A ‘GAME CHANGER'

Jean-Pierre Roux, who manages the [Future Climate for Africa](http://www.futureclimateafrica.org/) project, an effort, backed by UK aid, to improve climate information and resilience on the continent, said he worries that weak climate information and weather information services that do not meet the needs of vulnerable communities could hurt millions in Africa.

Having African scientists involved in climate information efforts is important as African researchers naturally have more expertise on local and regional weather and climate in many cases, he said.

Also, ""it gives a better chance for African priorities to shape the research agenda and leaves behind a legacy in terms of improved African capacity to conduct research,"" he said.

African climate scientists say they are also worried that the continent does not yet have enough climate scientists to collaborate with other experts globally on models and other work.

""A lot of model application work is being done in Africa, but not by Africans or at African institutions. That disempowers African intellectual development in this field,"" Sweijd told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Engelbrecht sees the development of his model as a chance to build skills in everything from climate science to high-performance computing.

""It is a game changer in enhancing our human capacity in the climate and earth sciences,"" he said.

2389794,"For remote Vanuatu islanders, fleeing climate disasters is an uphill battle by Lin Taylor | @linnytayls | Thomson Reuters Foundation

**Village chief Steve Bob is determined to move his 200 residents to higher ground as sea levels threaten their homes**

SOUTH RIVER, Vanuatu, Dec 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Villagers in South River, a palm-fringed coastal community in the low-lying South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, are used to battling cyclones, floods and tsunamis but are now facing a new threat - rising seas.

Worldwide, seas have risen 26 cm (10 inches) since the late 19th century, driven by melting ice and the expansion of water warmed by climate change, United Nations data shows, and scientists predict a rise of another metre or more by 2100.

With the risk that rising seas could eventually swamp South River on Erromango island, village chief Steve Bob is determined to move his 200 residents to higher ground but getting people to shift an hour's walk inland is proving to be an uphill battle.

Although the new land on offer is larger and at a site where their ancestors once lived, only one family has relocated since Bob proposed the idea a year ago.

""It's hard for me to convince everyone to move up. It's only when we're facing a flood or natural disaster that people are open to the idea,"" Bob said in Bislama through a translator to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""When there's nothing happening, everyone is less concerned about moving, and they don't worry about the potential danger that they can be in.""

Vanuatu, one of the world's poorest nations, is a sprawling cluster of more than 80 islands and around 270,000 people, 2,000 km (1,250 miles) northeast of the Australian city of Brisbane.

Perched on the geologically active ""Ring of Fire"", it suffers frequent earthquakes and tsunamis and has several active volcanoes in addition to threats from storms and rising seas.

It is also one of the nations most at risk from rising sea levels which menace coastal cities and communities around the world, with low-lying islands having the most to lose as most - or all - of their land could disappear beneath the waves.

Higher sea levels also aggravate the impact of worsening storms such as Cyclone Pam. In 2015, the category 5 cyclone devastated Vanuatu, including South River where palm-leaf thatched huts, cattle and boats were swept away.

""IT WON'T BE THE SAME""

Having lived through cyclones and floods, villager Stephanie Nonokinas knows how deadly climate change-related disasters can be but the 23-year-old said young people did not want to move.

""It's sad and it will be hard for us to live up there because we grew up here, we were born and bred here. It won't be the same anymore,"" she said.

For Freddy Sei, 15, being able to swim in the river, canoe in the sea, and fish with his friends on a whim, are a few of the things he would miss if families move uphill.

Last year, 24 million people globally fled at least temporarily to another area of their country because of a storm, flood, wildfire or other natural disaster, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), part of aid agency Norwegian Refugee Council.

Natural disasters displaced three times as many people as conflicts in 2016, according to IDMC data, and migration experts warn displacement around the world as a result of unchecked climate change could eventually dwarf other migration flows.

A 2015 global climate pact promised to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, with an ambition of limiting temperature rises even further to 1.5 degrees - a level seen as key to protect low-lying islands.

Currently, however, the world is on track toward a 3 degree rise in temperature - though the 2015 Paris climate deal includes a mechanism to boost action and try to bring that down.

Pacific islanders say they are clearly seeing the impacts of that warming already.

""Sea level rise is increasing, which causes a lot of changes along coastlines in the Pacific region. I'm concerned that more villages have to relocate,"" said Isaac Savua, head of operations in Vanuatu for aid agency CARE International.

Seline Bob, the South River chief's wife, is worried too.

""Sometimes the sun is too strong, and sometimes it rains too much. I fear that there's going to be another cyclone, maybe the same category as Pam, or worse,"" she said.

But the lack of drinking water up the hill has kept her from embracing her husband's idea to relocate.

""Once the water is sorted out, I would fully agree to move up because this place is becoming a danger zone,"" she said, cradling a grandchild as a dog slept in the shade and chickens roamed by.

It may not be a popular decision but village chief Bob said remaining in a disaster-prone area is a risk he is no longer willing to take. He said he has started building new houses up the hill and is even planning for a church.

""We've all grown attached to this place. It's hard to move everything and go up to a new place and start a new home again,"" he said.

""But (last year's) flood nearly submerged the whole community, which is why I'm taking a stand that we should move to higher ground.""",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2387939,"Putting Clean Cooking on the Front Burner **STORY HIGHLIGHTS**

- Efficient and clean cooking can reduce toxic air pollution, save lives, protect the environment, and improve livelihoods.

- Accelerating the transition to clean stoves and fuels requires sustained engagement in local markets, innovative approaches such as results-based financing, and a concerted global effort.

- As part of its long-term commitment to facilitating this transition, the World Bank has scaled up its support to the sector, with a $130 million portfolio across 13 countries that has benefited 11 million people to date.

 “Why do I get tears in my eyes when you cook inside the room?” asks Mamta’s daughter, looking at her mother while she prepares rice and daal in a chula, a firewood-burning cookstove.  

The smoke released from the burning wood is quickly filling up the small room of their home, in the village of Siraj Nagar, outside of Dhaka in Bangladesh. Most households in the village use a chula, exposing entire families to harmful fumes.

Just like Mamta, there are nearly 3 billion people around the world who still rely on traditional, inefficient stoves for cooking and heating their homes, which burn wood, charcoal, coal, animal dung or crop waste. The estimated health, environmental and economic cost of this continued use of solid fuels staggering: $123 billion annually. Women and children are disproportionally affected by the health impacts, and bear much of the burden of collecting firewood or other traditional fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions from nonrenewable wood fuels alone amount to a gigaton of CO2 per year – about 1.9-2.3 percent of global emissions.

Shifting to clean, efficient cooking can improve people’s health, reduce toxic air pollution, increase productivity and protect the environment. But changing cooking practices in households across the world is more complicated than it seems. It requires changing behavior and raising awareness of the benefits of clean cookstoves and fuels, as well as helping businesses to meet this demand with affordable products that customers value.

To meet this challenge, the World Bank has scaled up its commitments in recent years.  It now manages a $130 million portfolio in clean cooking and heating across 13 countries – one of the largest such portfolios in the world. Working with partners, and through its Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), the World Bank is taking a multifaceted approach combining innovative market-based strategies, efficient stove technologies, better affordability, development of supply chains, and a focus on consumer behavior.

World Bank programs in countries such as China, Ethiopia, Kenya, Indonesia, Senegal and Uganda have already benefited 11 million people who now have access to cleaner, more efficient cooking and heating solutions.  

These programs translate into countless individual stories. In Indonesia, Tami, a 24-year-old mother of two started using a Keren Super Stove as her primary cook stove with help from a program supported by the World Bank. She is now able to spend more time with her family and less time cooking and fuel collection. Yeni, another Indonesia woman who was formerly using kerosene, purchased a clean cookstove, and is now saving enough money to send both of her children to school. 

**""Facilitating the transition to clean cooking and heating contributes to fundamental development benefits, including improving people’s health, reducing air pollution, and enabling mothers to spend more time with their families and pursue economic opportunities. The focus now is on scaling up activity through innovative market-based approaches and by mobilizing private financing, and on applying the lessons we have learned from years of engagement in the sector.""**  

Riccardo Puliti    
Senior Director for Energy and Extractives at the World Bank  

Through results-based financing (RBF), the World Bank has helped private companies to enter the clean cookstoves market in China, Mongolia, Lao PDR, Bangladesh, Uganda, and Kenya. In Indonesia, a pilot project provided incentives to 10 private suppliers to distribute 10,000 clean cookstoves.  New technologies and delivery models are giving a push to the entire sector. Several international stove manufacturers have advanced designs and performance levels of biomass stoves that can substantially reduce emissions of pollutants known to cause serious health issues. 

The emphasis now is on high quality standards and cleaner fuels, such as gas, that can yield significant health and climate benefits. In Lao PDR, a World Bank RBF program aims to introduce 50,000 “super clean stoves,” the most advanced gasifier stoves available that meet World Health Organization standards for indoor air quality. A recent study looking at the health outcomes of low-emission cookstoves in Lao PDR  found that when used exclusively, the stoves reduced average kitchen pollution, fuel consumption per person and cooks’ exposure to air pollution. The study also found that long term usage of these stoves could reduce premature deaths by more than 20 percent.

Maximizing finance in the sector is also a priority. The World Bank, is leveraging additional funding from other partners to bridge the gap that will be needed to ensure that clean cooking is making a substantial development impact.

For example, the Carbon Initiative for Development (Ci-Dev) has signed purchase agreements for $37.8 million in GHG emission reductions from six clean cooking projects in Africa, which are expected to benefit more than three million people in 670,000 households, while helping to mobilize another $74 million in private sector financing.

Through supporting local cookstove initiatives, the World Bank is also helping improve livelihoods at the ground level. In Bangladesh, World Bank support to a program managed by IDCOL (Infrastructure Development Company Limited) helped to install one million clean stoves in homes by January 2017, nearly two years ahead of schedule. In the process, jobs were created as the stoves were made by local entrepreneurs and sold by local partner organizations.

Many of the lessons learned from these and other successful examples across the world can now be shared with exerts and practitioners across the world through a newly-launched Community of Practice, a global virtual platform open to the public, recently launched by ESMAP and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2387499,"Helping build sustainably productive farming systems through the work of the Asian Cassava Breeders, and Forage Legumes, Networks *by Madelline Romero*

Researchers from eight Asian countries – Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam – gathered on December 12-13, 2017 in Haikou City, China, to form the Asian Forage Legumes Network.

This is in response to the increasing pressure for farming systems in Asia to produce more without causing further harm to the environment.

“As soils deteriorate and become unable to provide the nitrogen that crops need, crops tend to look for other ways to obtain nitrogen,” explains Didier Lesueur, soil scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). “This is why nitrogen-fixation from the atmosphere is very important in agriculture. And the most important nitrogen-fixing agents in agricultural systems are the symbiotic – mutually beneficial – associations between crop, forage legumes, and rhizobia – the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that camp inside the root nodules of legumes.”

In addition to fixing atmospheric nitrogen (N), intercropped legumes contribute to enhancing soil carbon content through the leaves and root systems that remain in the field after harvest. When used as green manure, multipurpose legumes help in mitigation of soil erosion by providing a better soil cover. Beyond facilitating soil health, when used as forages, legumes provide high-quality livestock feed, thereby helping increase livestock production. These are some of the benefits of the integration of multipurpose legumes in farming systems. For scientists at CIAT, this is one way to sustainably diversify tropical crop-livestock systems in Asia.

“We would like for farmers to take advantage of the many benefits derived from nitrogen fixed in crop-livestock systems,” notes Sabine Douxchamps, integrated farming systems researcher at CIAT. “And we need to be able to answer a number of questions, like what are the economic benefits to a farmer, how much savings in fertilizer will it effect, and others, to encourage farmers to adopt certain farming practices.”

**Building a Forage Legumes Network in Asia**

The network looked into the current level of knowledge on biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by forage legumes in Asian farming systems. In the end, the group of researchers identified several broad research subjects deemed critical to understanding and promoting biological nitrogen fixation within the region.

As members of the Asian Forage Legumes Network, the researchers have committed to collaborate on research studies, as well as on a number of initiatives, including the identification and conservation of forage legume species that are tolerant to stresses such as those caused by salinity, drought, waterlogging, and acidity. Others are the establishment of a forage legumes rhizobia bank, testing of some commercial rhizobia inoculants, and development of quality control guidelines to ensure high-quality inoculants.

“In tropical areas like the parts of China that suffer from acidity, nutrient loss, and degradation, soil research is very important,” said Prof. Changjun Bai, Director of the Tropical Pasture Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS), the meeting host. “For the benefit of smallholders, it is important to pursue collaborative research projects.”

To this end, CIAT is brokering regional cooperation in agricultural science and technology by helping establish research platforms among Asian countries, jointly facilitated by CIAT and China.

**Asian Cassava Breeders Network**

An economically significant crop for many countries in Asia, cassava is one such research subject that has attracted collaboration among researchers in the region. A week before the meeting in Haikou City, researchers from CIAT, China, and a host of other research institutions and programs, met at the Kasetsart University in Thailand for the third annual meeting of the Asian Cassava Breeders Network (ACB-Net).

ACB-Net is a regional community of practice that brings together cassava breeders and other interested stakeholders for a systematic collaboration on cassava genetic enhancement and crop improvement. Established in 2015, the network includes classical breeding programs and molecular breeding laboratories, as well as public and civil society organizations interested in evaluating cassava varieties. Currently, some 28 organizations from the research, public, and private sectors, in 10 Asian countries, form membership of the network.

At the meeting, researchers shared updates on each their institution’s work on cassava breeding . They also discussed actions to address the issue of cassava mosaic disease (CMD), a disease caused by a virus and transmitted by whiteflies, and which causes cassava plants to produce few or no tubers at all. In Africa, yield losses induced by cassava mosaic virus (CMV) in different countries had ranged from 20 to 95 percent, at one point.

The disease’s presence was discovered in Cambodia in 2015. Since then researchers from CIAT and CATAS have been actively collaborating on regional surveillance together with partners in Cambodia and Vietnam. Results of the 2016 regional surveillance will be published in a peer reviewed publication, while a new round of regional sampling in 2018 will be coordinated by CIAT and CATAS.

“The fast pace of CMD spread is a huge concern for cassava production in mainland Southeast Asia,” said Stef de Haan, researcher at CIAT and member of the ACB-Net steering committee. “CIAT has already introduced sources of resistance to Thailand and Vietnam. ACB-Net will collaborate to further introduce additional breeding populations with resistance, from CCTRI in India and IITA in Africa. Incorporating resistance genes into breeding programs and testing the materials under intentional field-level exposure will require active collaboration between regional breeding programs. The network will allow for this international collaboration to take shape.”

Beyond CMD-resistance breeding, other activities that the network has in place for 2018 include capacity building events for young breeders; introduction and regional distribution of germplasm, including of elite progenitors; publication of standard procedures; and development of projects to address regional priorities.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2386699,"ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly: “Promoting the resilience of populations to natural disasters"" Port-Au-Prince, Haiti 18 December 2017/ ACP-EU JPA: The 34th session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) opened on Monday 18 December in Port-au-Prince, Haiti with a firm call by the Co-President Michele Rivasi for international decion-makers present to effectively address the impacts of natural disasters, and include climate change adaptation strategies in all sectors. 

Other key issues cited included the proper management of mineral resources in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries so that they benefit ACP sustainable development, peaceful political transition in Zimbabwe, and the outright condemnation of slavery practices in Mauritania and Libya.
""It is our duty to make every effort to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters for affected populations"", said Michèle Rivasi, Co-President of the ACP-EU JPA.

The 34th session of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) bringing together parliamentarians from the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and European Union (EU) countries was officially opened on Monday in Port-au-Prince by Haiti's President Jovenel Moïse, accompanied by Youri Latortue, President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Haiti. The co-chairs commended the Haitian authorities for their welcome in spite of the terrible hardships they had endured.
 
During the ceremony, Ibrahim Rassin Bundu (Sierra Leone), the JPA Co-Chair for the ACP, stressed how ""the Assembly and its members have been a positive force in the quest for sustainable development and poverty eradication"".  He reiterated the importance of the parliamentary dimension of the ACP-EU partnership to ""give a democratic nature to cooperation"". “The post-Cotonou Agreement must therefore continue to have a strong parliamentary dimension"", he added.
 
Responding to the challenges posed by natural disasters
 
Michèle Rivasi, acting co-president of the JPA for the European Union, stressed the increase over the last decade of ""catastrophic events that could destroy years of development and investment"". She has requested that people's resilience capacities be promoted. ""Security, poverty reduction and prosperity depend on the integration of climate change adaptation strategies in all sectors,"" she added. This urgent matter will be discussed on Monday and concluded with a resolution on Wednesday.
 
Valuing mineral resources for sustainable development
 
The Assembly will also debate this week on the link between ownership, exploitation and development of ACP mineral resources and sustainable development. These vast resources can be transformative for societies if local communities benefit from them, said the ACP-EU Co-President.
 
Other key topics of the 34th session
 
This session will also discuss the critical situation of migrants in Libya. There will also be an urgent debate and resolution on the risks of a deterioration of the internal situation in Mauritania. The parties also strongly wish to address the issue of slavery.
 
Support for the peaceful transition in Zimbabwe after 37 years of Robert Mugabe's rule and concerns the ACP has about institutional tensions in Catalonia is also on the agenda for discussion.
 
MEPs will discuss the issue of sustainable tourism as a vehicle for development with Isabelle Durant, Deputy Secretary-General of UNCTAD.
 
In addition, the Assembly will debate and vote on three resolutions on Wednesday 20 December on:
Challenges concerning the link between security and development in ACP and EU policies (debate Tuesday afternoon, co-rapporteurs: Mohammed Goumaneh (Djibouti) and Enrique Guerrero Salom (ES));
improving access to basic health systems, particularly in the fight against infectious diseases (debate Wednesday morning, co-rapporteurs: Mfanawemakhosi Dlamini (Swaziland) and Ana Zaborska (PL)); and

2385299,"Supporting Access to Finance for Climate Action: A Guide to Support Implementation of the Paris Agreement – Part One **1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW**

**What is climate finance?**

Climate finance refers to local, national or transnational financing, which may be drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing. Climate finance is critical to addressing climate change because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions, notably in sectors that emit large quantities of greenhouse gases, and to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of climate change .  
The Paris Agreement includes the goal of ‘making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development’, clearly signalling that all sources of finance need to be aligned with the adaptation and mitigation goals set in the Agreement. Through the Agreement countries commit to preparing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which contain the climate action they commit to as part of the global effort to transition to a low carbon, climate resilient world. These NDCs will be updated every 5 years with a view to increasing their ambition so as to reach the temperature goals set in the Paris Agreement.  
Developing countries signal in their NDCs the actions that they can implement with their domestic resources and the actions they can take if they received international support. 

**Sources of finance for climate action and NDC implementation**

Finance to support climate action and to implement NDCs comes from multiple sources and will not always be labelled or clearly recognisable as climate finance. For example, support to the health sector may be building capacity to cope with the increased prevalence of vector borne diseases associated with warmer temperatures, and investments in the agriculture sector may support for greater resilience to drought. In fact, given the considerable overlaps between activities to implement the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework, development finance will play a significant role, especially in the LDCs and SIDS, in supporting climate action .  
Development assistance will also play a role in leveraging private sector finance for climate action through, for example, the use of risk guarantee instruments or blended finance arrangements. 

The climate funds are important sources of finance for climate action and NDC implementation.  
The international climate funds include the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the funds led by the Multilateral Development Banks such as the Climate Investment Funds and bilateral funds specialising in climate. As a result, the climate finance landscape is very fragmented which increases the challenges associated with accessing finance and reduces overall efficiencies. This is why country ownership is essential, to guide resources to where they are most needed and to target the funds best suited to a country’s needs. The diversity of funds can have advantages, allowing for specialisation, for example, by focusing on LDCs or on specific aspects of climate action such as technology or adaptation.  
It is important to match countries’ or communities’ needs to the most appropriate source of climate finance. The procedures for direct access to the GCF or the AF may place these funds beyond the immediate reach of countries with very weak capacity, and in these cases access to finance via an international intermediary (e.g. UN agency) or through bilateral development assistance may be appropriate, while in parallel applying for readiness support to enable direct access accreditation in the future. Like development assistance, philanthropy has a role to play in catalysing other sources of finance for climate action, to fill any gaps (thematic or geographical) and to provide risk guarantees in order to attract private sector investment. Flexible and catalytic funding are as important as large scale investments and there is demand for both small amounts of easily accessible finance (e.g. through the GEF Small Grants Programme) as well as transformational finance at scale for major climate initiatives (e.g. through the GCF). Finding the right source of finance for a country or project is important – there is no one size fits all.  
Tools like the NDC Funding and Initiatives Navigator can help to identify the best fit fund for a particular context. 

**How much is needed?**

The UNEP Finance Initiative estimates that the costs of the transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies will need investment at an order of magnitude of at least USD 60 trillion, from now until 2050. This includes approximately USD 35 trillion to decarbonize, through renewable energy and energy efficiency, the world’s energy system; USD 15 trillion to adapt manmade infrastructure to changing meteorological conditions; and 2 USD trillion to reorganize global land-use is ways that meet growing demands for agricultural commodities while stopping tropical deforestation.

The UNEP Adaptation Finance Gap report estimates that the costs of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to USD 280–500 billion per year by 2050, a figure that is four to five times greater than previous estimates .  
There is of course a narrower definition of climate finance based on commitments made under the UNFCCC and focused on the commitment made by developed countries in Copenhagen in 2009 to mobilise USD100 billion per year in support for developing countries by 2020. Note that this includes both public and private sources of finance.

**Tracking finance**

There are efforts under way to measure progress towards the USD 100 billion target and climate finance mobilisation more broadly.

This includes the work of the UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance which has a mandate in relation to the Financial Mechanism of the Convention in terms of:

• Improve coherence and coordination in the delivery of climate change financing,

• Rationalize the Financial Mechanism,

• Mobilize financial resources, and • Measurement, reporting and verification of support provided to developing country Parties.

The committee produced the 2016 Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows Report which provides an overview of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries as reported in biennial reports, multilateral climate funds, climate finance from multilateral development banks and private climate finance.

In 2015 the French and Peruvian Governments in their capacities as Presidents of COP 21 and 20, commissioned a study by respectively the OECD and CPI ‘2020 Projections of Climate Finance Towards the USD 100 Billion Goal’ which concluded that USD 62 billion in public and private sources were directed to developed countries from developing countries in 2014. 

The OECD DAC uses the Rio Markers to track development finance that supports climate action in developing countries. Bilateral climate-related ODA from DAC members reached USD 29 billion per year in 2014-156 . Of this 49% (USD 14.3 billion) addressed mitigation only; 29% (USD 8.4 billion) addressed adaptation only; and 22% (USD 6.3 billion) addressed both adaptation and mitigation.

The OECD countries regularly report to the UNFCCC about their international climate finance support. They report in the form of National Communications (every four years) and Biennial Reports (every two years). This system of reporting will eventually be replaced by a new reporting system within the transparency framework under the Paris Agreement. The monitoring of climate finance flows is difficult and often contested as there is no clear definition of what constitutes climate finance and transparency is frequently an issue.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2384524,"As wild weather hits crops, Ethiopian women turn to savings **Savings groups are helping farmers - particularly women - get through bad times when harvests are lost**

**By Elias Gebreselassie**

GANTA KANACHAMA, Ethiopia, Dec 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Workinesh Denda, a stocky middle-aged woman, arranges hand-made stoves in a neat line in a small shop in Ganta Kanachama village, in southern Ethiopia.

""Before we had these (stoves) we could barely get by,"" she said. ""Endless drought would destroy our corn and teff harvests, leaving us with nothing to (sell) at the market or even feed our family.""

Increasingly erratic rain and recurring dry spells have slashed harvests and killed livestock in swathes of Ethiopia, raising fears of increased food insecurity.

Women often bear the brunt of such climate pressures, experts say, particularly as they usually have less power over their lives and are chiefly responsible for feeding their families.

""In Ethiopia's rural areas, which are dominated by patriarchal attitudes, women rarely have a say in household finances,"" explained Sintayehu Tsegaye, microfinance specialist at Mercy Corps, a charity.

To remedy this, a project is experimenting with savings groups as a way to give women more financial clout and an alternative income when crops fail.

**VILLAGE BANKS**

Denda's business was set up through one of over 300 village savings and loan associations (VSLAs) across Ethiopia, which aim to help members – most of whom are women – become more economically stable and independent.

The initiative, led by aid agencies Farm Africa and Mercy Corps, is part of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) programme, funded by the UK Department for International Development.

The groups meet weekly to pool their money, with the savings used to provide loans ranging from 300 to 3,000 Ethiopian birr ($11-110) to group members, at an interest rate of 10 percent if repaid within three months.

Requests for larger loans are referred to partner microfinance institutions in the area.

""Poor rural communities have little to no access to financial institutions like banks to build a cushion against climate extremes such as drought,"" Tsegaye said.

""So we aim for the savings groups to act as an emergency fund in case of bad weather or other needs, such as if a woman needs to give birth in hospital due to complications,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Group members also receive training on financial issues such as accounting to help them set up and manage their own businesses.

The project encourages members to diversify their sources of income so they are less vulnerable to climate shocks, such as the loss of crops to drought.

With a loan of 10,000 birr ($370) from a microfinance institution, Shela Shekene, a farmer from Ganta Kanachama, bought two cows, which he intends to fatten and sell at a profit.

""That will help me supplement my income,"" he explained. ""What I make from my (maize) alone isn't enough to feed my family.""

Tsegaye said the BRACED project is also teaching farmers how to better manage their natural resources - by planting trees, for example.

**WOMEN'S WORK**

The project is slowly but clearly changing attitudes and beliefs about the value of women growing crops and running their own businesses, Tsegaye said.

With other women from a savings group, Denda set up a business selling fuel-efficient stoves that the women make with sand, gravel and cement.

""The stoves emit less smoke than traditional ones made of clay, and last for five years instead of just a few months,"" she said, a smile spreading across her face.

""They also use about half the amount of wood, so they can help us preserve trees in the area,"" she added.

The women sell the stoves for 135 birr ($5) each to local families, and use the profits as a rainy day fund for the group's members.

**Not everyone initially approved of their venture.**

""At first the community didn't want me dirtying my hands using soil to make stoves, as they thought it makes women less attractive,"" said Denda, who previously had to rely on her husband giving her money.

""But now that they see how successful I've been, they accept it, and other women want to do the same,"" she added.

Tsegaye said the 1,500 members of BRACED savings groups in Ethiopia's Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' (SNNP) region went from contributing about 18 birr ($0.70) a week three years ago to 50 birr ($1.80) currently.

He called that ""a sign of how communities are taking this opportunity seriously"".

2384469,"Climate change may boost rain in Kenyan river basin - scientists **Kenya's Tana River Basin, which has experienced drought over the past few years, is likely to get wetter this century - scientists**

**By Alex Whiting**

ROME, Dec 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kenya's Tana River Basin, a major source of hydroelectric power, food and fresh water, may see its annual rainfall increase as much as 43 percent by the end of the century because of climate change, scientists said on Tuesday.

The river basin, stretching from the centre to the east of the country, is home to 8 million people. It supplies 70 percent of Kenya's hydro-power, and 80 percent of Nairobi's drinking water, according to UN Environment.

Scientists say the Tana River Basin, which has experienced drought over the past few years, is likely to get wetter this century, although they do not know for certain by how much.

If that happens, farmers may be able to grow more crops, thanks to a larger water supply, and the region could produce more electricity, scientists from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) said in a report.

The downside is that more water raises the risk of flooding, they added.

A wetter climate in the basin will affect decisions on irrigation and infrastructure like dams, said James Dalton of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which leads the ""WISE-UP to Climate"" project that produced the report.

Currently the basin has five major dams, with several more planned, he noted.

""Knowing in clear technical terms how climate change might affect the hydrology of the basin and, hence, the performance of these costly investments is extremely important for water managers and policy makers,"" he said in a statement.

The researchers used six climate change models, simulating different levels of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Report co-author Matthew McCartney of IWMI said the findings were largely in line with previous studies, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

""This is important, since modelling of climate change impacts on water resources is not an exact science and large uncertainties remain, which can lead to highly variable conclusions,"" he added.

Building on the successes and learnings of the 2012 Nutrition Policy, the new Nutrition Policy of the World Food Programme (WFP) reaffirms the organization’s commitment to addressing malnutrition as a primary channel to reach Zero Hunger. The new policy aims to contribute to the elimination of all forms of malnutrition—including overweight/obesity—and confirms addressing nutrition in emergencies as a central priority.  

As climate, socio-political and economic dynamics continue to place stress on food and health systems, and as alarming levels of malnutrition persist, new ways of improving nutrition are also required. The policy therefore puts forward an integrated approach to nutrition that simultaneously considers issues of availability, access, demand and consumption of nutritious foods – with a goal of adequate and healthy diets for vulnerable groups of all ages.  

With its strong operational and technical skills, WFP will use its broad range of nutrition experience in various contexts, both to support direct implementation and to provide governments with technical assistance in developing and sustaining nationally-owned nutrition solutions. To the furthest extent possible, WFP’s interventions will reinforce and align to national nutrition plans.  

As women often bear the primary responsibility for feeding their families, gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential to eliminating malnutrition. The nutrition policy reconfirms WFP’s commitment to implementing the WFP Gender Policy by considering societal and intra-household gender dynamics in the design of nutrition programmes.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"

By Lin Taylor

SOUTH RIVER, Vanuatu, Dec 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Each time teenager Freddy Sei hears the rumble of thunder, sees rains pound the earth in his small coastal village or watches strong winds whip palm trees, he is gripped with fear.

The 15-year-old lives in Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation that two years ago was ravaged by monster cyclone Pam with Freddy watching as huts were blown away and water rushed in to submerge his village of South River on Erromango island.

""I was scared because the winds just took the houses away, there was heavy rain and the river banks was overflowing,"" said Freddy, speaking through a translator.

""I'm scared that if it ever floods at night, it will come into my house and the flood will take me away. That's one of my greatest fears,"" said the small-framed boy, one of nearly 200 residents of the isolated seaside community of South River - vulnerable to flooding, landslides and rising seas.

A barrage of natural disasters across the low-lying Pacific islands is inflicting lasting mental trauma on children, with one healthcare expert describing it as a ""ticking time bomb"".

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) depression, anxiety, and suicide tend to increase after a natural disaster, according to a [March report by American Psychological Association (APA).](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/03/mental-health-climate.pdf)

People who survive multiple disasters, such as those living in disaster-prone areas, are likely to experience severe trauma, depression and other mental health problems, the APA said.

But children suffer the most.

""After climate events, children typically demonstrate more severe distress than adults ... Similar to physical experiences, traumatic mental experiences can have lifelong effects"" and even impair brain development, said the report.

""TIME BOMB""

As climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of natural disasters, mental health problems are going to worsen for children, said counsellor Sisilia Siga from Empower Pacific, a mental health service provider in Fiji.

""It's going to get worse, if (climate change) continues. Especially with children since it's hard for them to handle all these things that's happening,"" she said in an interview in Fiji's capital Suva.

Siga said she treated villagers in coastal areas during the aftermath of Cyclone Winston last year, the worst storm ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, which crashed into Fiji, killing at least 43 and leaving tens of thousands homeless.

She said she saw many children too traumatised to swim in the sea again, or having flashbacks when there were strong winds or when the ocean was at high tide.

Psychologist Loyda Santolaria, who was deployed in disasters like the 2010 Haiti earthquake, said children are often left to their own devices in the aftermath of a disaster, since many parents are too busy trying to secure food and shelter.

""The parents are unable to cope in a natural disaster, neither are they able to support their children's vulnerability and needs,"" Santolaria, who now works in Vanuatu with aid agency CARE International.

She said many of these children will grow up not knowing how to deal with these traumatic emotions and will become more susceptible to stressful situations.

This may lead to violence, depression, drug use or even suicide, said Alex Pheu, a mental health nurse working in Vanuatu's capital Port Vila.

""It's like a ticking time bomb. You have people who are scarred for life,"" said Pheu.

""(Children) learn to live with it until someone commits suicide, or someone hangs themselves on a tree, which I've heard has happened.""

With few mental health workers in the Pacific region, Pheu said training villagers in psychological ""first aid"", such as spotting signs of depression or anxiety before it becomes a full-blown issue, could help to boost resilience.

""Prevention and detection - that's the most important thing we should aim for,"" he said. ""But we always come too late and when we try to undo the knots it's very, very hard to manage.""

As for children like Freddy, living in a small community accessible only by boat, surviving the next inevitable flood or cyclone preoccupies his young mind.

""Climate change is getting worse,"" he said. ""I'm scared of it because there could be another flood and I don't want that to happen.""",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"

Niger is a priority country for the EU and one which it cooperates closely with under the Strategy for Security and Development in the Sahel and the New Migration Partnership Framework.

**Complex situation**

Niger faces many challenges: security, migration, environment, demography, development and the humanitarian situation. In 2016 it was second from bottom of the United Nations Human Development Index, despite having made progress in recent years in terms of economic growth and social development. The food security situation is structurally fragile because of poor harvests caused by drought and recurring floods (the result of climate change). Population growth continues to be a huge challenge for the government, with a growth rate of 3.9 % and a fertility rate of 7.6 births per woman.

The socio-economic and security situation in Niger has worsened considerably in recent years, particularly in 2017, mainly because of the growing criminal and terrorist threats and the ensuing humanitarian crises in the Lake Chad region and in areas bordering Mali and Libya. Around 260 000 displaced persons, refugees and returnees have fallen victim to this lack of security and remain heavily dependent on international aid, particularly humanitarian aid. The G5 Sahel Joint Force, which is about to become operational, should help reduce these security threats.

Despite these vulnerabilities and challenges, significant progress has been made in recent years in the economic and development sectors. This has been possible thanks to the considerable efforts made by the government to undertake reforms under the 2013-2016 «Economic and Social Development Plan» (PDES), the latest version of which for the period 2017-2021 will be presented at the Round Table in Paris on 13 and 14 December. These reforms must be consolidated if the country is to continue on the path of development. The EU is supporting Niger in its efforts and will continue to do so.

**Cooperation between the EU and Niger**

In line with its integrated approach, the EU is mobilising all available support instruments to strengthen the government's capacities in the areas of governance, security, the fight against irregular migration and trafficking, humanitarian operations and sustainable development in all its forms.

- EU financial support for development in Niger (National Indicative Programme) amounts to EUR 596 million under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) over the period 2014-2020. Seventy-five per cent of this funding is provided in the form of budget support, in order to foster and strengthen the State's capacities, particularly in the areas of justice, sound management of public finances, security, education and food security.

- Previously, under the 10th European Development Fund (2008-2013), Niger received a total of EUR 508 million, allocated to three areas: rural development and food security, regional integration and governance. Thirty-five per cent of this funding was provided in the form of budget support, with the aim of supporting the country's efforts to improve access to basic social services, protect vulnerable sections of the population and promote good governance and the rule of law.

**Examples of cooperation with Niger:**

**Sector Reform Contract for food and nutrition security and sustainable agricultural development (SANAD)** EUR 243 million from 2016 to 2020

Food and nutrition security and sustainable agricultural development, which affect 80 % of the population and involve the supply of raw materials to build up a strong agri-food sector, are the primary tool for development and the eradication of poverty in the country. This budget support programme aims to boost the government's financial capacity to achieve sectoral policy objectives, strengthen governance and promote sectoral reforms and policies, and to meet the basic needs of the population through improved access to services in the areas of sustainable agriculture, and food and nutrition security.

For example, the programme will help increase access to drinking water to 65 % nationwide by 2020 and reduce by 1 % each year the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children under 5 years of age.

**Sector Reform Contract for Education, EUR 77 million from 2016 to 2019**

The sectoral budget support programme for education is designed to support the efforts of the government of Niger to improve equal access, quality and governance in education. One of the main reforms targeted is the reduction of inequalities in access to education, particularly at primary and secondary level. In addition to respecting the fundamental right to education, keeping girls at school is closely linked with reducing cases of early marriage and fertility, thus contributing to better control of population growth. The Education SRC also supports improved quality of learning at school and increased efficiency in the education system, particularly by fostering reforms in the areas of management of teachers and public finances.

This programme has helped to increase the net enrolment rate from 62.6 % in 2013 to 66.1 % in 2017 and to significantly boost the primary completion rate from 78.4 % in 2016 to 83 % in 2017.

**The Emergency Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa**

In order to manage migration and displacement in Africa, the European Commission created an «Emergency Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa». The Trust Fund benefits a wide range of countries in Africa, especially those located along the main African migration routes to Europe. Niger is one of those countries.

Nine projects, worth a total of EUR 190 million, have already been approved for Niger under the Trust Fund. These projects are the EU's practical response to commitments undertaken as part of the Action Plan adopted at the Valletta Summit on 11 and 12 November 2015, in which Niger will play a highly pro-active and constructive role. Niger is currently the main beneficiary of the Trust Fund. The activities under the Emergency Trust Fund in Niger focus on protecting migrants and facilitating reintegration, strengthening the government's capacity to combat criminal networks and better manage its borders, as well as supporting host communities by creating economic alternatives for populations who live from activities related to irregular migration.

Niger also receives funding from regional instruments (Regional Indicative Programme for West Africa, intra-ACP programmes), thematic headings and other instruments, such as the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.

One example of a migration project in Niger is the Response mechanism and resources for migrants programme (EUR 7 million), in addition to the EU - IOM Joint initiative for migrant protection and reintegration (EUR 15 million from 2016 to 2020). The project aims to support Niger's response to the complex migratory flows passing through its territory, for example by promoting economic and social development through circular migration. The aim is to help national and regional authorities improve their governance of migration through the mechanism. From May to mid-November 2017, the initiative enabled the voluntary return of 3 603 migrants from Niger, who received assistance on arrival. Almost 49 000 migrants have benefited from awareness-raising activities since April 2017.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2381824,"If we fail to plan to adapt to climate change, then we are planning to fail as a country **The winner of the Building Resilience in Agriculture blogging challenge lays out possible solutions to address climate change and looming food insecurity in Kenya**

**By Francis Wanjohi**

As we move into 2018, the future of food security in Kenya looks bleak. Recurring climate change-induced droughts, floods, new diseases and the arrival of pests – such as the [fall armyworm](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/fall-armyworm-arrives-africa-heels-climate-change) – have affected our food production so much in the past five years that we can no longer produce enough food to feed our nation.

Things have gotten so bad that in February 2017, the government declared hunger a national disaster, prompting the duty-free importation of maize.

Kenya depends on maize as a staple crop. It’s what feeds most of our families, pays for our kids to go to school and even see the doctor. Maize makes the difference between hunger and prosperity; the poor and the rich. It is common to hear people say they are going to work to look for ‘_unga_’ (maize flour).

This year 250,000 hectares of agricultural land – that’s over 11% of the country's maize crop – was destroyed with the arrival of two unknown biological enemies, the fall armyworm and Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND). The fall armyworm has affected cereal production in 27 out of 47 counties with damage reaching 100% in most farms. This has left over [3.4 million people without food](https://www.tearfund.org/2017/09/kenya_drought_even_the_camels_are_dying/) and in desperate need of food aid.

Native to North and South America, many scientists believe the fall armyworm was able to run roughshod over huge portions of Africa in the wake of 2016 drought. It has now spread to more than 28 countries in Africa.

Sadly, it seems our staple happens to be a favourite meal for the fall armyworm and the viruses causing MLND. Since they affect the crop before it is ready for harvesting, farmers have watched helplessly as all their planted maize is consumed. Besides the yield losses, these farmers face hunger and hard economic times ahead, as they depend on farming for their livelihoods.

It is not easy to eliminate these pests and diseases. One thing is certain, we cannot just wish them away.

We therefore need to adapt and prepare for a future with more of these attacks. If we fail to plan to adapt to climate change, then we are planning to fail as a country.

We must therefore improve our resilience to hunger by diversifying our crop base; increasing our yield through use of technologies, storing surplus food using innovative post-harvest technologies, and investing in biotechnologies that will help us produce crops that are tolerant to drought, floods, pests and diseases.

All these can be carried out under climate change adaptation plans for agriculture. These measures will require serious concerted efforts and commitments by the Government of Kenya, development partners, research organizations and farmers.

The fall armyworm invasion could be compared to the locust plague in Egypt. We didn’t invite it to our door steps. While Kenya is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, we had very little contribution in creating it in the first place. What we need now are innovative solutions to the cold reality that if we don’t shape up now, and plan for the arrival of more pests, more droughts and more climate change-induced uncertainties, then we risk continued cycles of poverty and hunger.

2381644,"Understanding the costs and benefits of climate change adaptation in Thailand **UNDP-GIZ workshop on applying cost-benefit analysis and ecosystem-based adaptation supports adaptation planning for Thailand Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives**

**Thailand, 27-30 November 2017 -** In partnership with the **Royal Thai** **Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives** ([MOAC](https://eng.moac.go.th/main.php?filename=index)) **and its Royal Irrigation Department (RID)**, UNDP and GiZ organized a workshop and study tour to build practical skills in appraising projects and harnessing nature-based approaches to adaptation planning.

Following a series of prior trainings on related topics, the two-day advanced technical workshop held in Bangkok on 27-28 November targeted over 20 planning officers and economists from every line department within the agricultural ministry. Using a combination of both classroom learning and group breakout discussions, workshop participants learned from three international and two local experts on how to both conduct and independently critique cost-benefit analyses.

They also learned about measures to integrate water and land management into adaptation responses that could make agricultural-based livelihoods more resilient to future stresses from climate change such as increased drought or flash floods. Through cases studies of successful pilot measures for integrated water resource management already being implemented by a GiZ-programme on in Thailand with another ministry, MoAC officials better understood how valuing ecosystem services could be incorporated into future project appraisals and design. 

Most participants said the workshop was a great opportunity to learn more about the steps to conduct a CBA and how to apply various methodologies to adaptation planning. They underscored that the lectures will be beneficial in their work and that they have more knowledge.

In 2018, MOAC intends to formulate more climate-resilient programmes linked to central budget submissions aligned to the updated sector strategy on climate change and the National Adaptation Plan, with support from the joint UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans Programme (NAP-Ag).

At the end of the workshop, participants provided this feedback on their experience: “It really enhanced my existing knowledge of CBA, which I already use for project appraisal at RID. I’ve refreshed my knowledge and have a much clearer understanding of the concept and its application. If other agencies ask us for help in sharing about CBA in practice, I would be very pleased,” said a planning officer from the Royal Irrigation Department.

**Applying learning from the field**

Recognizing that classroom learning isn’t enough to fully appreciate the concepts, RID hosted the MOAC representatives to learn more from the practical experience of the “Yom Nan Water Management Project” covering a large area in Phitsanulok and Sukhothai provinces.

Initiated to address flood and drought problems in the Yom Nan River Basin, which are directly affecting riparian agricultural communities, an extensive water and agricultural management project has been designed by RID and an integrated team of experts from across MOAC, taking ecosystem-based adaptation lessons to heart. The project, supported by UNDP, is also likely to be the first full-scale investment proposal being submitted by Thailand for consideration by the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Participants visited a number of project intervention sites, including Ban Bangkaew floodgate. According to the project director at RID, the project will develop a database and early warning system related to water and climate, renovate water-control buildings, and the build the adaptive capacity of farmers and fishermen.

For example, under the project, the calendar for rice cultivation is being shifted to plant in April and harvest before flood season. Rice fields are then used to temporarily control water during the flooding periods. The water can be stored for future use in a retention pond, likened to a _“_[monkey’s cheek](http://www.thewaterchannel.tv/media-gallery/1860-monkey-cheeks-project-kaem-ling?quality=480)_”_ – a metaphor first coined by King Bhumibol Adulyadei of Thailand. This refers to monkeys’ habit of filling up their cheeks with excess food to save for a rainy day.

In addition to supporting the development of more robust future climate finance proposals in the sector, the workshop also aimed to build skills in tools necessary to prioritize investments and domestic budget resources for implementing the Thai National Adaptation Plan (NAP), in this critical climate-sensitive sector.

But in the end, while integrating agriculture in National Adaptation Plans requires capacity building at the ministerial and sectorial levels, the end goal remains building more climate resilient lives and livelihoods for vulnerable communities.

During the field visit, a farmer underscored the need and value of the proposed GCF-financed project. “The project can reduce the damage of productivity from flooding and reduce cost of pumping water into rice fields,” said the farmer. “This increases income and quality of life.”

2379994,"Migration, refugees and climate change: Big problems need big solutions By Joana Alfaiate

As the end of the year approaches, now’s a chance to look back at what the international policy priorities have been in order to see what might lie ahead next year.

I was at COP23 last month, the 23rd meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (UNFCCC). Based on this year’s event it seems that climate change might not be one of the global priorities for 2018. In spite of 2017 being the hottest non-El Niño year yet, international efforts to tackle climate change seem to be running out of steam.

At COP this year, a sense that other concerns might take precedent over climate and the Paris Agreement was pervasive. It was noticeable in the simplest things. Organisation was lacking, and the civil society and negotiation zones were more than a mile away, making access difficult and raising issues of transparency. And there were bigger concerns – such as complaints that there was no room on the agenda to address the neglected commitment of $100bn per year by developed countries by 2020.

Despite the general lacklustre atmosphere of the conference, there were a few positive steps to address long-standing issues. The global alliance to phase out the use of coal was formed, with more than two dozen countries, provinces and cities taking part. The Gender Action Plan was adopted, which requires gender to be a key issue for policy-making under the UNFCCC, indicating gender concerns as a continuing priority for 2018. Finally, the local communities and indigenous peoples platform was implemented, with the objective of giving indigenous people a voice in exchanging knowledge, technologies, practices and efforts to address and respond to climate change.

There are big policy concerns, however, that featured very little in negotiations, or at least didn’t feature as much as you might expect, considering their growing importance. Migration and the refugee crisis were one. Despite the decision to encourage the inclusion of migration into policy and planning for Loss and Damage mechanisms – established to address loss and damage associated with impacts of climate change – a substantive conversation that involves both climate and migration experts is missing. With the issue of migration, refugees and climate change very likely to remain some of the biggest global challenges for years to come, lack of understanding of how to tackle it in coordinated and mutually reinforcing ways could have devastating effects. Events and statistics from last year for children alone underscore this point.

UNICEF estimates that 500 million children live in flood-prone areas, 160 million children are exposed to severe drought, and 115 million children are exposed to tropical cyclones. The WHO estimates that every year, environmental risks take the lives of 1.7 million children under five years, representing the biggest global threat to children’s lives at the moment. At the same time, there are 50 million children in migration worldwide. One in every 200 children is a refugee. 20 million people were facing the threat of famine in Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen early this year due to severe droughts and massive food shortages, combined with conflict and extreme poverty.

Despite the huge sense of urgency these situations bring, and the dangerous links between climate change, insecurity and migration and refugee flows, not enough is being done to coordinate international processes on climate change and migration. Recognition of this led in part to the creation of the Global Compact for Migration, which is being set under the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants to address all aspects of international migration, including those that are related to humanitarian, developmental and human rights concerns. However, progress on the framework so far seems to suggest the ‘climate-induced migration policy gap’ is still not being addressed.

As highlighted by research presented at COP23 by the Hugo observatory, there’s still a disconnect between views and objectives related to climate and migration, which might render frameworks less effective in tackling these problems. One essential mismatch is how migration is viewed. In migration talks, the focus is on mitigation of climate effects to reduce migration and displacement. On the other hand, in climate fora, migration is seen as an appropriate adaptation to climate change rather than something that should necessarily be avoided or stopped. Simply put, migration might be the only option for people who have lost their land due to sea level rise, for example.

Migration and the global refugee crisis will, and should, be global priorities for 2018. However, it is important not to neglect climate talks, and to ensure that the critical links between climate change, poverty and migration are understood and acted upon.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2379624,"One Planet Summit drives forward climate action On 12 December 2017, two years after the historic [Paris Climate Change Agreement](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php) was adopted, Heads of State, governments, civil society and the private sector  gathered in Paris to drive forward climate action and financing of a Greener future.

Convened at the request of French President Emmanuel Macron, World Bank President Jim Kim and UN Secretary-General António Guterres,[ the One Planet Summit](https://cop23.unfccc.int/news/one-planet-summit-finance-commitments-fire-up-higher-momentum-for-paris-climate-change-agreement) launched new initiatives that assist in ramping up financial flows to developing nations as they implement their climate action plans under the Paris Agreement.

Finance is crucial for countries to green their economies and to build resilience to the inevitable impacts of climate change, which include more frequent and more severe droughts, flooding and storms.

“To save the climate, every player in society needs to be committed every day,” said French President Macron.

""The message is simple: those who fail to bet on a green economy will be living in a grey future"", said Mr Guterres.

Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary UN Climate Change, said: “Today has marked another extraordinary moment in the world-wide efforts to turn the promise of the Paris Agreement into a global reality—in other words delivering a climate secure future to all corners of the Earth and contributing to the sustainable future of every man, woman and child”.

“From the United Nations system to governments and investors, billions of dollars have today been mobilized and trillions more pointed towards a transformation of the world’s energy to agricultural sectors, adding to the finance that has already been flowing before, during and since Paris 2015”.

WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas joined heads of government and UN agencies at the event. He stressed the urgency of climate action given recent WMO reports showing that [carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/greenhouse-gas-concentrations-surge-new-record) increased at a record rate in 2016. The year 2017 is set to be one of the [hottest on record](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2017-set-be-top-three-hottest-years-record-breaking-extreme-weather), and about 1.1° Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial era, with much extreme weather.

“WMO provides you with the latest and best data and information on the state of the climate,” Mr Taalas said in a statement delivered to a panel session during the One Planet summit.

WMO has strengthened its collaboration with other United Nations agencies to reflect the impact of extreme weather and climate on food security, health and migration. WMO is also sharpening its focus on monitoring global water resources – one of the pressure points of climate change.

“We should not forget that countries in the front line of climate change often lack the capacity to collect their own data and observations. These are needed to provide the basic weather and climate services like early warning systems and seasonal forecasts that save lives and property and promote sustainable development,” said Mr Taalas.

WMO is stepping up action to build capacity in Least Developed Countries and small island developing states. This includes through initiatives such as the [Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems](https://www.crews-initiative.org/en) initiative (CREWS) and [Global Framework for Climate Services.](http://www.wmo.int/gfcs/)

In Africa, WMO is accelerating its efforts with the  [Africa Hydromet Programme](https://www.wmo.int/amcomet/sites/default/files/field/doc/events/amcomet_africa_hydromet_forum_communique_-_23_sept.pdf), carried out with the African Development Bank and the World Bank under the aegis of the [African Ministerial Conference on Meteorology](https://www.wmo.int/amcomet/)(AMCOMET) and the African Union Commission.

At the Opening of the Summit, French Minister for Foreign Affairs Le Drian and Japan Minister for Foreign Affairs Taro Kono stressed the importance of climate information and early warning systems for effective climate change adaptation and committed to support the CREWS initiative, as did a senior representative of the [Green Climate Fund](http://www.greenclimate.fund/-/early-warning-systems-move-onto-the-climate-finance-radar?inheritRedirect=true&redirect=%2Fhome). 

The Paris gathering took place less than a month after the UN climate change conference (COP23) in Bonn. It is the first in a series of international summits to help countries to raise ambition and bolster their national climate action plans, which is crucial to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The One Planet summit was preceded by [Climate Finance Day](http://www.climatefinanceday.com/one-planet-summit/) on 11 December to determine how those working in public and private finance can innovate to support and accelerate common efforts to fight climate change.

Specifically, the One Planet summit was designed to:

- Showcase climate action initiatives that are underway and which can be scaled-up with the right kind of support
- Announce several bold new initiatives that will provide new financial resources in key areas such as renewable energy, small-scale farming, support for women and forestry in developing countries
- Explore how the world’s financial architecture can be transformed to unleash the trillions of dollars that will be needed for sustainable development globally

Next year, the US state of California, the UN and other key partners will host another major conference to fast forward action ahead of the UN Climate Conference 2018 in Poland (COP24), and a summit to raise ambition will be convened by the UN Secretary General in 2019.

2379619,"WMO El Niño/La Niña Update - December 2017 **Current Situation and Outlook**

Sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have recently cooled to weak La Niña levels. Similarly, most atmospheric indicators are now consistent with the early stages of a La Niña event. Climate models indicate that weak La Niña conditions are likely to persist into the first quarter of 2018. A return to ENSO-neutral conditions before early 2018 is less likely, while the emergence of El Niño before the second quarter of 2018 appears very remote. National Meteorological and Hydrological Services will continue to closely monitor changes in the state of ENSO over the coming months.  

Since October, sea surface temperatures across much of the tropical Pacific have shifted from neutral to weak La Niña levels, with temperatures of 0.5 to 1.0 degrees Celsius below average in the east-central part of the basin. Atmospheric indicators also show La Niña patterns, including enhanced precipitation over the far western Pacific and an area of reduced rainfall near the International Date Line. Additionally, enhanced trade winds are observed in the western tropical Pacific and sea level pressures are higher than normal in the eastern Pacific and lower than normal in the west – both indicative of La Niña conditions.  
In central to eastern Pacific, waters at depth have remained moderately cooler than average since October and extend several hundred meters below the surface. These waters, which often provide an indication of the coming conditions at the surface, do not suggest any warming of the cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures during December and into January.  

Most models surveyed predict that sea surface temperatures in the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean may experience some additional cooling over the next two months, but will remain in the weak La Niña range (0.5 to 1.0 degrees Celsius below average). A small number of models predict cooling to more than 1.0 degrees Celsius below average. Based on these predictions and expert assessment, the chance of La Niña continuing into the first quarter of 2018 is 70-80%. There is virtually no chance of El Niño developing before the second quarter of 2018.  

It is important to note that El Niño and La Niña are not the only factors that drive global climate patterns, and that the strength of ENSO does not automatically correspond to the strength of its effects. At the regional level, seasonal outlooks need to assess the relative effects of both the El Niño/Southern Oscillation state and other locally relevant climate drivers. For example, sea surface temperatures of the Indian Ocean, the southeastern Pacific Ocean and the Tropical Atlantic Ocean are also known to influence the climate in the adjacent land areas. Regionally and locally applicable information is available via regional and national seasonal climate outlooks, such as those produced by WMO Regional Climate Centres (RCCs),

Paris, France, 12 December 2017 - Today, at the [One Planet Summit](https://www.oneplanetsummit.fr/en/) in Paris, the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and World Bank Group, the world’s largest multilateral development bank, announced a new partnership to provide technical and financial assistance to 150 cities across the world undertaking aggressive climate action programs.

[The World Bank’s investment of $4.5 billion USD will ensure cities battling the increasing threats of climate change have the funding necessary to implement sustainable initiatives and climate resilience programs.   ](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/12/12/global-covenant-of-mayors-and-world-bank-announce-partnership-for-climate-action#)

The partnership will help countries leverage the private sector by developing bankable business plans, structuring public-private partnerships to crowd in private sector investment, monetizing increases in land values, and designing and implementing credit enhancement mechanisms to allow commercial financing to cities.

The partnership brings together the largest global alliance of cities committed to tackling climate change with the world’s leading development institution to design and structure climate resilient investments and to catalyze new sources of capital to finance them in cities across the globe.

The lending will occur over the next three years under the umbrella of the World Bank’s [City Resilience Program (CRP)](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disasterriskmanagement/brief/city-resilience-program), and will draw on resources from IFC and MIGA to provide financial and technical assistance to 150 cities, including current and future Global Covenant cities, to drive climate ambitions forward and upwards and build greater resilience to climate and disaster risks.

The partnership will be inclusive and open to the full spectrum of investors, from multilateral development banks and international financial institutions, to institutional investors, private investors, and local commercial banks.

Ultimately, this [collaboration between the Global Covenant of Mayors and the World Bank will help ensure cities realize the investment potential of their climate action commitments](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/12/12/global-covenant-of-mayors-and-world-bank-announce-partnership-for-climate-action#), and will have the ability to contribute to their government’s NDC investment plans in order to meet their Paris Agreement targets.

2377864,"Agriculture takes a leap forward at Bonn Climate Talks UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Programme highlights need for sectoral adaptation planning  
  
Bonn, Germany – The signature decision on agriculture coming out of this year's climate talks in Bonn, called the [Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj2tOfhwYrYAhUO12MKHR4-CyAQFggpMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Funfccc.int%2Ffiles%2Fmeetings%2Fbonn_nov_2017%2Fapplication%2Fpdf%2Fcp23_auv_agri.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1quagaS9tMkkvzIIMZ6K-l), provides a new opportunity to address how climate change impacts on agricultural production have put millions of lives and livelihoods at risk worldwide.  
  
""This bold landmark decision brings agriculture to the forefront of the international climate change agenda, and looks directly at important issues such as assessing adaptation and mitigation benefits of agriculture, improving soil health, nutrient management and livestock systems, and addressing the socio-economic and food security issues associated with climate change in the agriculture sectors,"" said Julia Wolf, Natural Resource Officer and Coordinator from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for the joint UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans Programme [(NAP-Ag)](http://adaptation-undp.org/naps-agriculture%3E).  
  
Agriculture has been an agenda item within the UNFCCC's Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) since 2011. Parties and observers are invited to submit views, by 31 March 2018, on what elements should be included in the work programme, particularly on modalities for the implementation of outcomes from the five workshops held on matters related to agriculture during the years of negotiations.  
  
""This decision allows us to take new steps to address the role of agriculture in National Adaptation Plans and in particular contributing to the achievement of the Paris Agreement Goal on adaptation, while promoting poverty reduction, safeguarding livelihoods and promoting resilient societies,"" said Rohini Kohli, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) coordinator for the NAP-Ag Programme.  
  
During COP23 in Bonn, a NAP-Ag side-event, with presence from partner countries, the [Green Climate Fund](http://www.greenclimate.fund/home); and [Global Water Partnership](http://www.gwp.org/), underscored the need to engage the private sector, implement gender-responsive approaches and improve local climate governance to connect the agriculture sectors with more effective climate change adaptation plans.  
  
In her introduction to the session, Wolf underscored the need to leverage finance for National Adaptation Plans to ensure the integration of agricultural sectors by tapping into existing synergies and activities at national level.  
  
**Addressing climate risks in Uganda**  

In [Uganda](http://adaptation-undp.org/naps-agriculture/partner-countries/uganda), 72 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, out of which 77 percent are women and 63 percent are youth. But women have less access to resources such as land, tools and seeds, and are less engaged than men in the higher rungs of the value chain for agricultural products, according to Stephen Muwaya, Senior Range Ecologist from the Uganda Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.  
Muwaya highlighted NAP-Ag Programme support on gender analysis in Uganda to ensure that the unique impact of climate change on women and youth is fully reflected in climate change adaptation plans.  
Muwaya also indicated that one of these important synergies lies in connecting resilience of cropping, livestock, fisheries and integrated fishers resource management into adaptation plans.  
  
To execute these plans more effectively, Uganda is working to build more effective climate information services, early warning systems and [disaster preparedness](http://adaptation-undp.org/projects/ldcf-ews-uganda).  
  
Climate change adaptation projects are also being careful to involve both men and women in learning activities, ensuring that a fair number of trainers are women, promoting gender-inclusive climate-smart technologies, engaging young people through school programmes, and leveraging Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to share weather and market information.  
  
**Local community action in the Philippines**  

Another example of how agriculture is being integrated into climate change adaptation planning comes from the [Philippines](http://adaptation-undp.org/naps-agriculture/partner-countries/philippines), where climate change, new pests and disease, and the destruction of coastal habitats threaten yields from staple crops and is undermining efforts to build more climate resilient livelihoods.  
  
The vision of the Philippines, according to Lerey A. Panes from the Philippines' Department of Agriculture, is to enable local communities to manage climate risks while pursuing sustainable livelihoods. The Government of the Philippines is achieving this goal through its flagship Adaptation and Mitigation Initiatives in Agriculture programme (AMIA)[(http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/environment-energy/mdg-carbon/NAMAs/adaptation-and-mitigation-initiatives-in-philippine-rice-cultiva.html%3E).  
  
The programme, which started in 2015, seeks to support the introduction of climate relevant technologies at the local level across the country, working in very close collaboration with municipalities and the local communities.  
  
Through AMIA model villages, the programme is sharing climate information services, disaster risk reduction tools, training and computer-aided decision-making technology, while also working to ease access to credit, insurance and improved market access.  
  
In its next phase, the Philippines will be scaling up the AMIA programme to contribute in achieving 9 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Phillippines was referred to as a NAP Champion in a separate side event hosted by the UNFCCC. NAP-Ag programme support was acknowledged for assisting in the integration of the AMIA programme into an increased number of sectoral and national policies in the Philippines.  
  
**International partnership**  

Effectively integrating agriculture into adaptation plans will require continued international support, capacity building, improved evidence-based decision making, and partnerships across a variety of related sectors.  

Jason Spensley, Manager of the Green Climate Fund's Project Preparation Facility and Adaptation Planning Support Programme, underscored the need for Nationally Designated Authorities to look at specific climate change issues and related sectors when formulating project proposals and adaptation plans in order to leverage support from the most adequate sources.  
  
The Global Water Partnership [(GWP)](http://www.gwp.org/%3E), represented by its Executive Secretary for Southern Africa Alex Simalabwi, highlighted the need for partnerships in addressing multidimensional issues like water in these multi-sector approaches.  
  
Approximately 50 participants attended the Bonn side event, including the Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industries, and Fisheries of Uganda, his Excellency Ssempijja V. Bamulangaki.  
  
At the event, the NAP-Ag Programme officially launched a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on [National Adaptation Plans: Building Climate Resilience in Agriculture](https://napmooc.uncclearn.org/). The ongoing course, developed in partnership with UNITAR, provides step-by-step guidance on ways to integrate agriculture in climate change adaptation planning processes, and is an important learning tool in achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement, Sendai Framework and 2030 Agenda.  
  
In her closing remarks, Lea Herberg, from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) highlighted the need to bring the private sector into the financing mix.  
  
""The NAP-Ag programme is helping unpack the National Adaptation Plans process,"" said Herberg. ""Sectoral integration is key for the success of adaptation planning.""  
  
The joint UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Programme supports partner countries to identify and integrate climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sectors into relevant national planning and budgeting processes. The programme is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), through its International Climate Initiative (IKI).

2377534,"Climate Change Threatens Mexican Agriculture By Emilio Godoy

MEXICO CITY, Dec 14 2017 (IPS) - Azael Meléndez recalls the tornado that in May 2015 struck his hometown of San Gregorio Atlapulco, in Xochimilco, on the outskirts of Mexico City.

“I had never seen anything like it, and I asked my parents, and they said the same thing,” the farmer told IPS.

The tornado lifted fences protecting gardens in the area, whose name means “place in the middle of the water” in the Nahuatl language, and which is located on the south side of greater Mexico City, which is home to 22 million people.

For Meléndez, who has a horticultural project with two other farmers, this is one of the manifestations of climate change, “which has devastated the area along with urbanisation.” The group uses the ancestral method of “chinampas” to grow lettuce, broccoli, radish, beets and aromatic herbs.

They grow crops on an area of about 1,800 square metres, harvesting about 500 kilograms of products per week, which they sell to 10 restaurants, in the wholesale market in the capital and tianguis (street markets).

Water shortages, an unstable climate, proliferation of pests, infrequent but more intense rainfall, hail and the effects of human activities are affecting an area that is crucial for the supply of food and for climate regulation in the Mexican capital, says a study by the international environmental organisation Earthwatch Institute.

The system of chinampas, a Nahuatl word that means “the place of the fertile land of flowers”, was practiced by the native peoples long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 15th century.

The Aztec technique is based on the construction of small, rectangular areas of arable soil to grow crops in the microregion’s wetlands, with fences made of stakes of ahuejote (willow), a water-tolerant tree typical of this ecosystem.

The chinampa method is used on a total of 750 hectares, where about 5,000 farmers work.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) classifies it as one of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), for preserving agrobiodiversity, helping farmers adapt to climate change, guaranteeing food security and fighting poverty.

But not only this microregion is affected by climate change. Indeed, it is difficult to find a place in Mexico that is not exposed to it.

The May report “Estimates of potential yields with climate change scenarios for different agricultural crops in Mexico”, by the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change, projected a decline in rainfall in the country.

The report, focused especially on crops of corn, beans, wheat, soybeans, sorghum and barley, found that water productivity is decreasing for most crops, which means water requirements will increase in the medium term. It also found yield loss for the seven crops, especially marked in the case of corn, beans and wheat.

In the southern state of Chiapas, farmers are already facing water shortages, sudden and heavy rains, floods and rising temperatures.

“The areas need water, we need water for the land, renewed soil, because that is the baseline. And it’s not exclusive to Chiapas, it is happening throughout Mexico,” Consuelo González, a farmer in Chiapas who grows corn on 40 hectares of land, told IPS.

González, a representative of a producers committee for her state, said there are also problems of deforestation and bad agricultural practices.

Chiapas, the second-poorest state in the country, has a sown area of 1.42 million hectares and 62 crops. Among its main products are corn, pastures, coffee, sugar cane, bananas, mangoes, beans and oil palm, which account for nearly 90 percent of the state’s total production.

The 12 most important crops produce 10.11 million tons. In the case of corn, the yield reaches 1.5 tons per hectare, half of the national yield of 3.2 tons, due to the size of the plots and low level of mechanisation.

In 2010, the region passed the Law for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in the State of Chiapas, and one year later it implemented the Climate Change Action Plan.

In its nationally determined contribution (NDC), incorporated two years ago in the Paris Agreement on climate change, Mexico included strengthening the diversification of sustainable agriculture among the measures to be adopted by 2030.

Among the instruments to achieve this goal, it establishes the conservation of germplasm and native species of corn and the development of agroecosystems through the incorporation of climatic criteria in agricultural programmes.

In its NDCs, the country pledged to reduce its polluting emissions by 22 percent by 2030, compared with 2013 levels.

That year, Mexican agricultural activity released 80.17 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By 2020, emissions of this potent greenhouse gas are expected to reach 111 million.

By 2030, the goal is to curb agricultural and livestock emissions to 86 million tons.

“Agriculture is highly dependent on local weather conditions and is expected to be very sensitive to climate change in the coming years. In particular, a warmer and drier environment could reduce agricultural production,” said Eduardo Benítez, assistant representative of Programmes at the FAO Partnership and Liaison Office in Mexico.

Among other consequences of climate change, he mentioned to IPS a higher prevalence of fungi and pests, soil transformation, less availability of land and water for agriculture and alterations in agrobiodiversity.

“They give something, but it’s not enough,” Meléndez said about the government’s support for helping the “chinamperos” – farmers who grow crops using the chinampa method – adapt to climate change.

“It has cost us a lot of work. We carry out prevention work, such as using biological filters, to raise water in the channels to a certain level for irrigation. We try to regulate the temperature with meshes of different sizes that provide shade for the crops,” he explained.

One of the problems lies in the lack of coordination among Mexican institutions, as shown by the assessment of the Government’s 2014-2018 Special Programme on Climate Change (PECC), implemented by the government to address the phenomenon.

This analysis shows that the Information System of the Cross-cutting Agenda that operated between 2009 and 2012 is not working since the programme came into force in 2014, which prevents a “close follow up” of the progress of its 199 lines of action.

In addition, it found that the National Climate Change System has not addressed the question of connecting programmes, actions and investments at the federal, state and municipal levels, with the PECC.

González, based on her experience as a farmer, recommended silvopastoral (combining forestry and grazing) systems to maintain the plots. “There are areas that can be well preserved. We focus on soil conservation. Another solution is agroecology,” to restore soils and preserve resources, she said.

FAO and the government Agency for Marketing Services and Development of Agricultural Markets (ASERCA) are working on a project of early warnings for agriculture based on agrometeorological information to monitor the climate impacts on food production and availability.

The aim is for this data to be available to “policy-makers, financial and risk management institutions and mainly to producers. Thus, public policy can be oriented in actions such as the promotion and use of crop insurance or the activation of contingency funds,” said Benítez.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2377409,"Coastal hazards and climate change: Guidance for local government This guidance supports councils to manage and adapt to the increased coastal hazard risks posed by climate change and sea-level rise. It:

- provides information on the effects of climate change on coastal hazards, incorporating the latest science and relevant legislation, information from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment’s 2015 report on sea-level rise, and feedback from stakeholders  
- recommends a new ‘pathways’ approach to adaptive planning that is dynamic and flexible. It is designed to be used when there is uncertainty about future physical conditions affecting the coastal environment  
- contains new sections on collaborative approaches to engaging with communities (which is central to the adaptive planning approach) and local government roles and responsibilities  
- outlines a 10-step decision-making process that councils and communities can follow when planning for the effects of climate change on coastal hazards.

This 2017 guidance is an update of the 2008 edition. The previous edition was more of an engineering manual, and the new edition contains more information for planners and for use in the planning process.

2377364,"Adapting to climate change in New Zealand: Stocktake report from the climate change adaptation technical working group This report is the first report prepared by the Climate Change Adaptation Technical Working Group. It summarises the expected impacts of climate change on New Zealand over the medium and long term, takes stock of existing work on adaptation, and identifies gaps in New Zealand’s current approach.

In taking stock of the work already underway the Group identified three characteristics that need to be in place for effective adaptation to develop in New Zealand:

- being informed about how our climate is changing and what this means for us  
- being organised, with a common goal, a planned approach, the right tools, and clear roles and responsibilities  
- taking dynamic action to proactively reduce exposure to the social, cultural, environmental and economic consequences of climate change.

The report concludes that New Zealand is in the early stages of planning for climate change with many positive initial steps being taken across a number of sectors – it is in the informed phase, with some areas having advanced to the organised phase.

The information in the report is current as at May 2017, when it was first delivered to the Minister for Climate Change Issues.

2376509,"Water Security at Risk to Climate Change 15th December 2017 **Tonga is highly dependent on intermittent rainwater harvesting and thinning groundwater levels for potable water, and such rainfall patterns and thin groundwater lens is further exacerbated with the onset of climate change through prolonged drought periods and rising sea-level. It is a real threat to our water security, Tonga’s Head of Delegation told the Asia Pacific Water Summit. **

The CEO for MEIDECC (Ministry of Meteorology, Energy, Information, Disaster Management, Environment, Climate Change and Communications), Mr. Paula Pouvalu Ma’u, was heading Tonga’s delegation to the Third Asia Pacific Water Summit been held in Yangon, Myanmar, from 11-12 December, 2017.

He reminded the Summit that water and the plethora of issues concerning water security is considered and remains the highest of competing priorities in many if not all our countries in the region.

“A drop in rainfall due to drought could severely affect Tonga’s access to freshwater, and those options to desalinate seawater are energy intensive and beyond its economic limitations,” he said. Drought at the same time, could seriously affect Tonga’s agricultural and livestock production.

He further added that saltwater contamination by sea level rise and storm surges already affected freshwater for human consumption in the low-lying islands of Tonga.

He further emphasized that partnership of common interest, exemplified through forums such as this, and in which Tonga and the Pacific have regionally expressed through the regional Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific 2016 (FRDP). This framework is not only intrisically aligned to SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, but also to national instruments such as Tonga’s Strategic Development Framework, Tonga’s Joint National Action Plan on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management, and international instruments such as the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the SAMOA Pathway, the Sustainable Development Goals overall.”

But as we know, goals and aspirations as such are continuously hampered by unprecedented rates of coastal erosion, increasing occurrences of flash flooding, prolonged drought periods, outbreaks of both water and vector-borne disease which are further compounded by tropical cyclones that are increasing in frequency and intensity.  These are all climate change-related effects.

The ominous effects of climate change on national water security entails we take greater steps toward alleviating the risks to our scarce water resources. The adoption and implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was indeed a giant step to solving these issues, including positive outcomes from this summit, he said.

These within-reach solutions can be further enhanced into concrete actions throughout and beyond the International Decade on ‘Water for Sustainable Development 2018-2028.

Mr. Ma’u also conveyed his indebtedness and his delegation to the Asia-Pacific Water Forum and its Secretariat for their impeccable organisation and arrangements of the Summit, and Myanmar for their kind and excellent hosting.

He was joined by Mr. Sione Talo Fulivai, Principal Climate Finance Officer of MEIDECC.

2374604,"Action on Climate and Security Risks: Review of Progress 2017 **Executive summary**

This report looks at progress made on policy and practical responses to climate-security risks for 2016-2017. Using the independent G7 commissioned report A New Climate for Peace as a basis, and building on last year’s report, Towards A Global Resilience Agenda, this year’s report sets out the key achievements, pitfalls and new challenges facing the foreign policy community working to reduce climate-fragility risks.

2017 saw ongoing and worsening political conflict and humanitarian crises. At the same time, we have witnessed a year of climate extremes. Devastating hurricanes, floods and tropical storms buffeted the Caribbean, North America and South Asia, whilst drought and desertification push thousands more towards extreme hunger in the Sahel and the Middle East. Arctic ice is at its thinnest level ever and a vast iceberg, twice the size of Luxembourg, broke off an ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula.

As climate extremes and conflicts are increasing, so too are geopolitical and socioeconomic extremes. The world is currently and simultaneously facing high levels of uncertainty around the fragile new world order, the highest levels of displaced people in decades, and a peak in global hunger - affecting 11 per cent of the world’s population.  
These trends all affect each other, and are projected to worsen.

The global political and economic context has been a major stumbling block for political progress on tackling climate and security risks. The global economy has still yet to recover from the 2008 crash. And efforts to put economic recalibration onto an environmentally sustainable track have been hindered by a shift to nationalist populism across Europe and the US, Brexit, the Trump administration and the rise of right-wing parties such as Alternative für Deutschland in Germany have made it difficult for political leaders and officials to push this agenda.

Nevertheless, there has been political progress and opportunities. Positive developments in the climate and security space in the past year include steps taken towards new and deeper partnerships for resilience, for example, between the EU and China, across 14 US states following Trump’s threatened withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and between municipal authorities around the world through alliances such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. There has also been greater acknowledgement of climate-fragility risks in national and global fora, policies and strategies, for example in the EU’s Global Resilience Strategy, UN Security Council Resolution 2349 on Lake Chad, and the Australian Senate Inquiry into climate and security. Various global frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the New Urban Agenda - the global agreement for promoting sustainable urban development, and the Global Compact for Migration - the first ever global level agreement on migration and displacement are now being implemented, presenting opportunities for promoting long-term and sustainable solutions to the root causes of climate-security risks. And there have been steps to operationalise action to address climate-fragility risks, for example, the G7 and partner states are supporting a comprehensive risk assessment of Lake Chad. But these practical steps towards implementation - which are few and far between – need to be scaled up, driven deeper and multiplied to have lasting impact.  
Against this context, our review of progress presents a mixed bag. US President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement has not yet been nearly as damaging as commentators had feared. Yet other steps which appeared positive, such as the UNSC Resolution on Lake Chad including an entire, unprecedented paragraph on the role of climate change on the crisis, failed to live up to expectations, with the ensuing Report by UN Secretary General Guterres failing to make any reference to climate change at all.  
Added to this are new issues which remain largely unaddressed in policy and practice and require further attention, such as the implications of climate change on urban security, the risks to security of transitions to low carbon energy, and the links between climate change and radicalisation.

These circumstances present three key tests for addressing climate-fragility risks:

1. Shifting dynamics in international cooperation and leadership opens new space to address climate-security risks at the international level through new mechanisms and within new alliances.

2. More people than ever before are at risk. Urgent and growing humanitarian needs underscore the critical importance of better preventative action, even as most resources continue to be channelled into dealing with crises ex post.

3. As efforts to operationalise commitments under global frameworks such as Agenda 2030 roll out, the need for enhanced cooperation and coordination between policies, actors and their actions under various frameworks becomes more apparent than ever - if they are ever to effectively address climate-security risks.

But on balance, the policy progress, emerging partnerships and tentative steps towards action on building resilience to climate-security risks offer more grounds for optimism than for pessimism.

Notwithstanding this cautious optimism, the urgent challenge to move from analysis to action on addressing climate-fragility risks remains. To this end, we set out three, cumulative steps to help catalyse the much needed transition from analysis to action to build global resilience:

1. Partner for resilience: The complex nature of climate-fragility risks requires many actors – international and regional institutions, civil society, and the private sector – to work more closely together. An institutional home for climate change and security within the UN system would provide much needed a locus for leadership, cooperation and joint-action. Greater cooperation between the G20 Development Working Group and G7 Climate Fragility Working Groups would also enable better coordination and stronger global leadership on the issue.

2. Prioritise prevention: This means a move towards a new funding and programming paradigm which puts prevention first. Steps would include:

 • Moving from post-crisis response, with prevention focused on only the most immediate risks, to early and urgent action to directly tackle and manage the full range of risks that could lead to climate related conflict.

 • Strengthening national institutions’ capacity to focus on prevention, enhancing governance legitimacy and expanding the scope of and calibre of government actions.

 • Combining short and long-term approaches. Shorter-term results increase the buy-in for investment in sustained and strategic approaches to prevention.

3. Move from analysis to action: Successfully addressing climate-related security challenges requires knowledge sharing, partnerships, and getting out of separate silos. It requires the emergence of a new community of practice, a road-map to consolidate, strengthen and catalyse action to address climate-fragility risks, and a joint commitment towards a set of shared goals. To advance this goal, the Planetary Security Consortium have set out an Agenda for Action in The Hague Declaration.  
It contains practical commitments governments, institutions and organisations can take on specific thematic and geographic areas. The Hague Declaration is an example of the kind of efforts required to move from analysis to action, by contextualising the recommendations of the G7 commissioned report A New Climate for Peace in specific regions and sectors.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2374534,"Sri Lankan civil society poised to support Green Climate Fund project in the Dry Zone Galgamuwa, December 8, 2017 – Four leading civil society organizations have been inducted as partners in the newly-launched [Green Climate Fund-supported project in the Dry Zone](http://www.greenclimate.fund/-/strengthening-the-resilience-of-smallholder-farmers-in-the-dry-zone-to-climate-variability-and-extreme-events-through-an-integrated-approach-to-water-), ensuring communities will play a leading role in building their own resilience to climate change.

Hosted December 5-6 by the [Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment](http://www.environmentmin.gov.lk/web/) – the implementing Ministry for the project – in Galgamuwa, the orientation workshop was attended by [Janathakshan](http://www.janathakshan.com/index.php?lang=en), [Sri Lanka Red Cross Society](http://www.redcross.lk/),[South Asia Partnership Sri Lanka](http://www.sapsri.lk/), and [Palm Community Development Services.](http://palmsrilanka.com/home/)

The four organizations were selected from 45 applicants in a competitive process, based on their experience in working with communities as well as in minor irrigation, agriculture, drinking water, and disaster risk reduction.  

Over the coming year, the organizations will support project roll-out in the target districts Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Puttlam, and Kurunegala (until end 2018). Their role will encompass raising awareness of climate change; mobilizing local involvement in planning, implementation and monitoring; identifying and communicating communities’ needs and feedback; and coordinating with authorities. 

“Working closely with the civil society organizations is really crucial to climate change adaptation,” said Buddika Hapuarachchi, the Project Manager. “Their role is indispensable to the success of this project, in ensuring project target beneficiaries are aware and supportive of its activities, in boosting cooperation between stakeholders at different levels, and in paving the way for the sustainability of the project beyond its lifetime. It’s by involving communities right from the start – and fostering their ownership and leadership – that a project like this will endure.”   

The agenda of the two-day workshop focused on an introduction to the project; examination of impacts of climate change on the Dry Zone, especially to smallholder farmers; adaptation gaps and the theory of change behind the project; cascade-based approach for climate change adaptation; environmental and social safeguards and gender considerations; and monitoring and evaluation.

Janathakshan will support in Anuradhapura district; Sri Lanka Red Cross Society in Kurunegala district; South Asia Partnership Sri Lanka (SAPSRI) in Puttlam district; and Palm Community Development Services in Vavuniya.

**About the project**

Launched in September 2017, with support from the Green Climate Fund, the 7-year project ‘Strengthening the resilience of smallholder farmers in the Dry Zone to climate variability and extreme events through an integrated approach to water management’ (the ‘Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project’) aims to increase the climate resilience of poor and vulnerable households in the Malwathu, Mi, and Yan river basins.

The project, for which UNDP provides technical support, pioneers a holistic approach to enhancing Dry Zone water security and agricultural productivity, and for the first time in a project in Sri Lanka, will include climate smart initiatives designed to combat the effects of extreme weather events on the continuity of irrigation and drinking water supplies.

The project specifically targets women and youth groups in implementation, maintenance, monitoring project investments.

Since launching in September, the project has:

Entered an agreement with the International Water Management Institute, to develop a model for cascade water resource development and management (an key first step towards restoring of the cascades: one of the essentials for Dry Zone cultivation since ancient times);
Carried out environmental surveys, with design work already in progress for three cascades in Anuradhapura and Vavuniya (including within them 54 village irrigation systems). The project is in the process of deploying survey teams to cascades in Vavuniya and Puttlam.
Identified water-stressed, vulnerable communities and sources for water supply schemes in the districts of Puttlam and Vavuniya.

2374364,"Hard Choices Integrated Approaches: A Guidance Note on Climate Change Financing Frameworks **Bangkok, Thailand, December 14 2017** – This week during Asia Pacific Climate Week, UNDP launched a [Guidance Note](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Hard%20Choices%20-%20Integrated%20Approaches.pdf) on how to create and refine Climate Change Financing Frameworks – the flagship product of UNDP's Strengthening the Governance of Climate Change Finance Programme (GCCF).

The product, which guides Asia Pacific governments in the better management of climate finance and can increase the effectiveness of these growing resources in a region at risk – is a world first in providing advice and assistance for the new frameworks.

Domestic and international resources to respond to and mitigate climate challenges are increasing in the region. The Climate Policy Initiative's Global Climate Finance Landscape report estimates that in East Asia, South Asia and the Pacific from 2015-2016 public investments for climate change reached USD154 billion, and of this, 79% of finance was spent in the same country in which it was spent.

As these resources (particularly domestic resources) scale up, it is critical that governments have integrated whole-of-government strategies that ensure they are used efficiently and effectively to reach those who need them most.

To achieve this, specifically tailored Climate Change Financing Frameworks (CCFF's) outline the policies and processes to better manage, mobilize and target climate finance. UNDP has assisted the governments of Cambodia, Nepal, Indonesia and Pakistan create CCFF's and the new Guidance Note – Hard Choices, Integrated Responses - has drawn from the practical knowledge and lessons learned from that implementation.

""Increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of how climate finance is delivered will play a key role in how countries can move towards realising the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" said Tom Beloe, UNDP's Governance, Climate Change Finance and Development Effectiveness Advisor.

""Looking forward, climate financing strategies and CCFFs also present unique opportunities to integrate gender equality and other social development concerns to the mutual benefit of all agendas,"" he added.

The note contains direct, tailored advice for Line Ministries, Climate Policy Bodies and Ministries of Finance and Planning including how to coordinate a CCFF programme of work.

Accompanying methodological notes will be issued that provide more detailed step-by-step guidance on building blocks within within a CCFF.

2374154,"Hurricane-hit Caribbean states target future safe from climate harm By Sophie Hares

TEPIC, Mexico, Dec 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A group of Caribbean nations, many devastated by recent hurricanes, will work with companies, development banks and other organisations to curb damage from climate change and grow cleanly, under an action plan launched this week.

The countries aim to restructure up to $1 billion in debt to free up cash for coastal defences, switch from costly imported fuels to cheaper green energy, and buffer their communities and economies against the effects of global warming, including rising sea levels and heavier storms and floods.

Angus Friday, Grenada's ambassador to the United States, said the idea was to ""inject a new DNA"", breaking away from business-as-usual and bureaucratic measures so as to be able to act faster.

""Given the next hurricane season is just seven months around the corner, it's really important we move with the speed of climate change now,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

Hurricanes Maria and Irma left a trail of destruction as they crashed through the Caribbean earlier this year, and many low-lying nations fear their infrastructure and economies will be devastated by more powerful storms and encroaching seas.

With many economies in the region plagued by high levels of debt, Caribbean nations have been pushing for rich countries to help bolster their defences and in turn, protect livelihoods.

Eleven nations, including Jamaica, Grenada, Dominica and the British Virgin Islands, signed up to the plan to create a ""climate-smart zone"", unveiled at the ""One Planet"" summit in Paris on Tuesday.

The plan's backers include the World Bank, the Nature Conservancy, the Green Climate Fund, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and British businessman Richard Branson, whose Caribbean island Necker was hit by Hurricane Irma.

Branson has pushed for a scheme to help vulnerable islands, centred on replacing outdated fossil-fuel power grids with renewable energy systems that can better withstand extreme weather and boost economic development.

The Caribbean region needs $8 billion to roll out national plans to tackle climate change under the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Around $1.3 billion has been pledged to help islands rebuild in the wake of the recent hurricanes, while a further $2.8 billion has been committed through longer-term investment and debt restructuring plans.

The Nature Conservancy, a U.S.-based environmental charity, wants to work with lenders and governments to find ways to restructure $1 billion in sovereign debt and free up funds to invest in the ""blue economy"", a statement said.

That would include restoring and better managing coastal areas, and harnessing natural resources such as mangroves and coral reefs to protect vulnerable islands.

Using insurance to transfer disaster risk is another component of the climate-smart plan, backed by Swiss Re and the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) which paid out almost $30 million to countries hit by Irma.

""Ultimately, we will only win the battle on climate change when investments in climate action and broader resilience become the economically sensible decision to make every time,"" Allen Chastanet, prime minister of St. Lucia, said in a statement.

""It's not just about protecting against negative impacts – climate action needs to be about enhancing competitiveness, creating jobs, improving our economies.""

2373884,"EU will support Niger with assistance of €1 billion by 2020 *European Commission - Press release*

Brussels, 13 December 2017

Overall EU development assistance to Niger will amount to €1 billion for the period 2017-2020. This was announced by Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica at the Donors' Round Table for Niger in Paris.

At this occasion, Commissioner Mimica stressed: ""Niger is facing numerous challenges and has already demonstrated on many occasions a strong political willingness and leadership to confront those challenges. The European Union will support the country with around 1 billion euros for the period of 2017-2020. Our focus will be on ensuring the delivery of basic social services, while continue addressing the pressing security challenges. One cannot come at the expense of the other. ""

This EU assistance was jointly defined with the Nigerien Government and will help to implement Niger's 2017-2021 Economic and Social Development Plan. EU support will further contribute to strengthening State capacities and the delivery of social services. It will help to boost job creation and economic growth as well as increase food security and resilience and fight against climate change. A particular focus will be put on gender equality, girl's empowerment and education. EU support will also sustain good governance efforts, the reform of the country's security and justice systems, as well as the fight against irregular migration, trafficking and smuggling.

As part of the €1 billion envelope, Commissioner Mimica and the Nigerien Minister of finance, M. Massoudou Hassoumi have signed a first financing agreement of €40 million to increase the EU's support in the sector of nutrition, food security and resilience. They also signed an agreement amounting to €64 million to build hybrid power plants in Agadez and in Gorou Banda. The action is co-financing from the French Development Agency (Agence française de développement), with EU grants worth €21 million.

**Background**

Niger faces major challenges in terms of development, where the population is in dire need of provision of basic services, job creation, rural development and access to energy. EU support to Niger under the National Indicative Programme (11th European Development Fund) amounts to €596 million for 2014-2020. It focuses on four sectors: (1) Food security, nutrition and resilience, (2) Reinforcing State capacities to implement social policies, (3) Security, Governance & peace consolidation and (4) Road access to areas affected by insecurity and conflict risks.

Niger benefits from the full range of European instruments to support its role in maintaining stability in the region, to address the economic, budgetary and humanitarian challenges and to support the country in implementing its national development plan for the benefit of the people of Niger. Niger is the first beneficiary of the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, which aims to address the root causes of instability, irregular migration and forced displacement.

The EU also supports the country in facing instability and insecurity, such as a surge of armed terrorist groups, increased transnational organised crime activities, as well as armed banditry, irregular migration and trafficking. To help tackle this, the EU is supporting Nigerien authorities through our civillian Common Security and Defence Policy Mission EUCAP Sahel Niger with advice and training, in order to strengthen their capacities in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. The EU also committed to support the Joint Force of the G5 Sahel countries (Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad) with €50 million to improve security and cross border cooperation in the region.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"

Never has it been so pressing to address climate change. So let’s hurry to embrace a proven part of the solution. The radical (but not new) concept of agroforestry – be it integrating trees to create shade over coffee bushes, adding trees to Colombian cattle ranches, or managing and encouraging shea trees to flourish amid millet crops in the Sahel – must move to centre stage.

2372884,"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Commits $300M (€255M) to Help Farmers in Africa and Asia Cope with Climate Change *Gates Foundation funding complements investments from the European Commission ($318M/€270M) also announced today, bringing total agriculture R&D commitments to over $600M (around €525M)*

PARIS, Dec. 12, 2017 — Today at the One Planet Summit in Paris, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pledged $300M (around €255M) over the next three years (2018-2020) to support agricultural research that will help the world’s poorest farmers better adapt to increasingly challenging growing conditions brought about by climate change, including rising temperatures, extreme weather patterns (droughts and floods), diseases, poor soil fertility, and attacks from crop pests.

Two-thirds of the world’s poorest people live in Africa and Asia, and roughly 800 million of them rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. These smallholder farmers play a negligible role in generating carbon emissions but they suffer some of the harshest effects of climate change. As the climate changes, farmers’ ability to produce crops to feed their families or earn an income will be increasingly threatened. Livelihoods will be destroyed and climate-related pressures could force people to abandon their homes and communities, in search of better conditions.

Poor farmers in developing countries will need the most innovative tools and technologies to adapt to the effects of climate change. There is an urgent need to equip them with the tools that can make their crops more productive, sustainable, and resilient in the face of a rapidly changing environment. The Gates Foundation’s announcement today is in direct response to the needs articulated by developing countries in their adaptation plans in three areas:

**Crop improvement:** at a time where the world population is growing, new discoveries are on the horizon to help meet the growing demand for food. These include boosting photosynthesis to generate major increases in crop yields and enhancing the natural processes employed by plants such as soybeans and peanuts that draw nitrogen from the air into the soil for more efficient crops that use less water and fertilizer. Combining big data with robotics to scan large fields of crops will also help breeders better understand plant characteristics (height, leaf structure, growth) and ultimately improve the speed of crop breeding.

**Crop Protection:** investments will specifically help farmers protect their crops from drought, floods and heat, as well as attacks from plant pests and diseases. Scientists already are producing breakthrough varieties, including drought-tolerant rice and maize and heat-tolerant beans, and developing new ways to detect and control diseases that can destroy cassava, sweet potatoes and yams -- crops that are crucial to feeding 800 million people in West and Central Africa.

**Crop management:** in addition to new technologies, innovations in managing existing farmland will help give farmers new insights into the most advanced practices, particularly ways to help preserve and enhance soil fertility that allow them to sustainably boost production.

The Gates Foundation’s commitment comes in addition to a $318M (€270M) commitment from the European Commission announced today, with additional commitments from Member States still to be finalised. Taken together, the funding from the European Commission and the Gates Foundation to help farmers increase crop yields, respond to environmental threats, and adapt their farming methods to climate change will amount to over $600M (around €525M) over the next three years.

Also today, the Gates Foundation and the BNP Paribas Foundation, in partnership with the Agropolis Foundation, launched the One Planet Fellowship, a €15M 5-year programme to support 600 young African and European researchers who are working to help African farmers adapt to climate change.

Speaking at the One Planet Summit, Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said:

“Agriculture is the most promising path out of poverty for individuals and countries. The disproportionate impact of climate change on the world’s poorest people means that there is a more urgent need than ever to help the poorest farmers improve their productivity in the increasingly tough conditions that they continue to face.

“We are excited to join forces with the European Commission to drive forward research and innovation that will help farmers improve their crop yields, respond to climate pressures and have access to the latest developments in farming practices. Together we can help smallholder farmers improve their livelihoods, lift more families out of poverty, and contribute to a sustainable global food system.”

2372869,"No escape from discrimination: Minorities, indigenous peoples and the crisis of displacement EMBARGO: 00.01 (GMT) 14 December 2017

Guaranteeing stronger rights protections for all, including minorities and indigenous peoples, rather than building walls or restricting travel, is ultimately the only effective and sustainable response to the forced displacement of millions of people around the world today, says Minority Rights Group International (MRG) in a new report.

The rights organisation is launching No escape from discrimination: Minorities, indigenous peoples and the crisis of displacement to mark International Migrants Day<http://www.un.org/en/events/migrantsday/>.

‘The world’s leaders are planning to gather in 2018 to sign two Global Compacts – one on refugees and one on migration,’ explains Carl Söderbergh, MRG’s Director of Policy & Communications. ‘We fear that in the rush by most states to emphasise border control and return, the rights of those affected by displacement will get lost – most especially minorities and indigenous peoples.’

The report focuses on the discrimination behind displacement among minorities and indigenous peoples, and the drivers uprooting them from their homes, such as conflict and extremism.

In Myanmar, amidst an orchestrated campaign of executions, sexual assault and village burning, an estimated 600,000 Rohingya have been forced to flee during 2017. But their persecution has its roots in their exclusion from the list of 135 state-defined ethnicities in the 1982 Citizenship Act. Violent crackdowns, dislocations and discrimination meant that the majority of Rohingya people could not meet subsequent documentation requirements, in practice rendering the whole community stateless.

Minority communities, such as Yezidis, are at risk of disappearing in Iraq following large-scale violence and displacement. In Central African Republic, violence by anti-balaka fighters has led to the virtual removal of the country’s Muslim minority in some areas.

**Climate change and land rights violations also play a part.**

In Colombia, military and business interests have exploited the vacuum caused by the decades-long civil conflict to appropriate large swathes of communal land belonging to Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations, who comprise 70 per cent of those displaced in the first half of 2017. In India, of the more than 60 million displaced by mining and industrial developments since independence, around 40 per cent are Dalits and another 40 per cent tribal people.

Hundreds of thousands of nomadic herders in Mongolia have been forced in recent years by increasingly unstable weather conditions to resettle in Ulaanbataar, where they reside in informal settlements without access to basic services or adequate housing.

Importantly, the report also looks at how discrimination shapes the experience of minorities and indigenous peoples whilst in transit.

Members of religious minorities from Syria who have fled to refugee camps in neighbouring states such as Jordan or Lebanon, may face continued discrimination not only from officials and citizens in their host country, but also from fellow Syrians belonging to other communities.

Finally the report examines the hostility from majority communities to new arrivals, and how this shapes the experience of integration and inclusion once minorities and indigenous peoples settle in the new countries they now call home.

Hostile attitudes about diversity and multiculturalism which were once fringe have now become mainstream, whilst the debate about current immigration and the needs of long-established minorities within arrival countries has become blurred, says MRG.

In Hungary, the recent vilification of refugee arrivals, particularly Muslims, has exacerbated age-old discrimination against Roma. In the Netherlands Wilders has specifically spoken about the country’s ‘Moroccan problem’ and was convicted by a court in December 2016 of inciting hatred.

‘Governments must urgently address racism and discrimination towards minority refugees and displaced at every stage in the process of flight – as a root cause of displacement, as a contributing factor towards the exploitation while in transit, and as a barrier to integration upon arrival,’ urges Söderbergh. ‘Simply put: less restrictions, more protections.’

2372754,"UN Launches Initiative to Improve Climate Resilience of Women in the Sahel Paris, 12 December 2017 - A new United Nations initiative, aimed at building the resilience of a million women and youth in the Sahel to climate impacts through smart agriculture, was launched today at the One Planet Summit. The launch coincides with a gathering of world leaders in the French capital to mark the anniversary of the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement.

The climate smart agriculture programme will leverage information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide access to agriculture assets. Using a digital platform, known as “Buy-From-Farmers” or AgriFed, small-scale women and youth farmers will be connected to customers, suppliers, information, markets and finance to help build their economic identity and make them valued entrepreneurs, able to end food insecurity in the Sahel.

The initiative is a programme of the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) and the G5 Secretariat. The participating UN agencies are the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the UN’s children’s organization UNICEF, UN Women, the World Food Programme, the International Organization for Migration, the UN Population Fund, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the UN Development Programme, under the umbrella of the United Nations Office for West Africa (UNOWAS).

The G5 Sahel, the institutional framework for development coordination among the five countries in the region—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger—has identified combatting climate change and environmental degradation, along with their effects on rural populations, as a priority. At the national level, governments are working on adaptation strategies; the new initiative is designed to support those efforts.

UN Women presented the programme, which is among some 12 showcased at today’s Summit, on behalf of the UN system.

Women make up more than 40 per cent of the agricultural labour force in the Sahel and play a critical role in enhancing food security and nutrition. In most places with high prevalence of undernourishment, women farmers have significantly less access to land, information, finance and agricultural inputs. This makes them more vulnerable to climate shocks, and affects their health and the food security and nutrition of the entire household. Lack of employment, on the other hand, puts youth at risk of terrorist recruitment.

The One Planet Summit, co-hosted by the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, and the President of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, is aimed at supporting the formal UN process on climate action as nations look to raise climate ambition in the run up to 2020.

The Summit aims to showcase and launch innovative projects and initiatives that boost financial flows to support developing countries’ national climate action plans in areas ranging from agriculture to renewable energy.

It also looks at measures needed to reform, redirect and reset the global financial system so that eventually trillions of dollars of finance flows into climate action under the Paris Agreement and the wider Sustainable Development Goals.

Background on the new programme to boost resilience of women and youth in the Sahel

The joint UN initiative responds to 12 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and has the potential to economically empower at least one million people, mostly women, youth and marginalized groups in the Sahel, doubling their income in three years.

Building upon climate-smart programmes currently being implemented by the UN agencies participating in the joint initiative, it will contribute to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture. These include: increasing productivity and incomes without damaging the environment; enhancing adaptation by strengthening local communities’ resilience and capacities; and mitigation, by reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions through responsible farming, soil management and afforestation.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"

2372234,"Caribbean leaders launch ambitious plan to create the world’s first “climate-smart zone” **The Caribbean Climate-Smart Coalition seeks rapid implementation of US $8 billion climate investment plan that will transform regional energy system, build resiliency, drive economic growth and set a global example**

Paris, 12 December 2017 - The UN Development Programme (UNDP) announced its support to Caribbean leaders gathered today during the launch of a new public-private coalition to create the world's first ""climate-smart zone"" to support the parts of the region decimated by some of the most powerful hurricanes to ever cross the Atlantic in September.

The announcement came at the One Planet Summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris to review progress made on the Paris Agreement adopted by global governments two years ago today.

Alongside the on-going recovery efforts, the Caribbean Climate-Smart Coalition aims to find a way to break through the systemic obstacles that stop finance flowing to climate- smart investments. With the right domestic and international reforms, the world can step up – and help unleash the means to catalyse an ambitious US $8 billion investment plan to bring greater energy and infrastructure resilience to 3.2 million Caribbean households. This would help Caribbean islands to eliminate their costly dependency on fossil fuels so that they can meet close to 100% percent of their energy needs from renewable sources, and to embed resilience into communities and livelihoods to realise the bold ambitions of all Caribbean people.

Caribbean leaders have brought together a Coalition of global organisations such as the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank, as well as businesses and supporters from the Caribbean and the international community. The Coalition aims to reinvigorate the islands that have been impacted by recent hurricanes Irma and Maria, and help build more resilient infrastructure and communities across the region as the likelihood of future extreme weather events increases.

Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada, Chair of CARICOM, said: “Caribbean leaders have come together as a powerful collective to build a better future for the people of the Caribbean. We welcome the financial commitments from our partners – around US$1.3 billion for recovery efforts and US$2.8 billion toward the vision shared by all members of the Coalition and others. This is a great first step. Now we need to turn this possibility into a set of realities that benefit all our people. We all need to work together to change the rules of the game to accelerate climate-smart financial flows for the Caribbean and other small island developing states. Together we can build thriving economies fuelled by clean energy, nature-based resilient design and innovation. The time for action is now.”

Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of Dominica, said: “Despite the immense human suffering and economic damage caused by the recent hurricanes, the people of the Caribbean do not want to be just passive victims of climate change. Rather, they want to be active participants in designing and implementing solutions, and for their Caribbean region to serve as a beacon of hope for island nations all over the world.”

The announcement comes nearly a month after over 400 high-level representatives from governments, multilateral and civil society organizations and the private sector gathered at UN headquarters on 21 November at the “[CARICOM-UN High-level Pledging Conference: Building a more Climate-Resilient Community](http://resilientcaribbean.caricom.org/) ” to help countries “build back better” as the first climate-resilient countries in the world.

 “The next hurricane season is only six months away so achieving climate-smart and resilient development for the Caribbean is critical. Affected individuals are the focus of the $5 billion recovery process, but this effort will only be successful if it involves the private sector, civil society and governments at all levels working together for a more resilient Caribbean. Last month, close to $2.5 billion was pledged at a conference co- organized by CARICOM and UNDP for recovery and resilience in the Caribbean, and it is our objective to facilitate joint efforts with the work of the Caribbean Climate-Smart Coalition.” said Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP.

Coalition members will help to establish partnerships that can make investment deals happen. They will also bring their collective abilities together to break down the technological and financial barriers that represent the last obstacles to Caribbean people grasping the transformational opportunities that are in reach.

2372149,"Games About Change: An Activity Book highlighting the impacts of Energy, Infrastructure, Transport, Technology projects in Asia and the Pacific **Energizing sustainable development: launch of new publication highlights the role of energy in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and mitigating climate change** 

December 13 2017, Bangkok – As UN agencies gather under the banner of Climate Week in Bangkok, the UN Development Programme has launched a new publication connecting the dots between energy, poverty, and climate change action. 

The colorful book, ‘Games About Change’, combines impact case studies from 16 countries across Asia and the Pacific with games and activities designed to spur readers – whether they be students, parents and children or policy makers– to think about energy and the ways in which the world can shift to a cleaner, more sustainable future. The book aims to translate “technical talk” into plain language, supported by facts and figures.  

Access to affordable energy, infrastructure, transport and technology is interlinked with reducing poverty and inequality. Yet with the planet on track to a potentially catastrophic three degrees Celsius of warming, the answers must lie in clean, renewable energy sources.

Energy poverty continues to impact communities around the world. A majority of households in rural areas across Asia and the Pacific remain without access to modern forms of energy to cook, light their homes and provide heating. 

Governments are making bold efforts to improve access to energy and reduce emissions. The book highlights examples of UNDP-supported projects from India – where the government is working to improve energy efficiency in the national railway systems and to develop sustainable urban transport – to Indonesia, where efforts have focused on nurturing investment in the renewable energy sector.

The book also draws on personal stories to illuminate the link between energy and women’s empowerment, education, and health.

In Islamabad, the story of a student benefitting from a new metro bus service, designed to reduce road emissions but also making it safer for women travelers;

In Bangladesh, the story of a father for whom a new solar lantern system was life-changing, enabling his children to study and for life to go on at night;

In India, the story of women being trained as “barefoot solar engineers”, learning to assemble, install and maintain solar-powered lights and lanterns in their villages;

In Hebei, the story of a rural family, including a ninety-year old grandmother, for whom a new house made from energy efficient bricks slashed heating and cooling bills.

In Tuvalu, the story of a nurse for whom access to 24-hour solar power will improve her workplace’s ability to store life-saving vaccines and medicines, and to power equipment used for the treatment of acute medical issues.

The launch of the publication is timely: moving from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy remains squarely on the international agenda. Climate talks concluding in Bonn (COP23) last month focused heavily on scaling-up action to meet commitments to reduce carbon emissions, set out under the Paris Agreement. 

Statistics bring into stark relief the magnitude of the challenges which confront the global community in meeting demand for energy, while also reducing dangerous greenhouse gas emissions.

By 2030, the world’s energy consumption is predicted to increase by 30-50 per cent. Global transport emissions are expected to rise 120 per cent by 2030 (from 2000 levels). Transport-related CO2 emissions are expected to increase 57 per cent worldwide between 2005 and 2030.

“Access to reliable and sustainable clean energy both enables and accelerates progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Haoliang Xu, Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations and Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific. 

“All the Goals are interconnected and in fact, the achievement of Goal 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’ contributes to each of the others, including eliminating poverty and hunger, enhancing health and wellbeing, and achieving inclusive and quality education. 

“This book brings to life the issues, the challenges, but most importantly, the solutions at hand.”
Globally, UNDP supports sustainable energy across more than 110 countries, with almost 260 projects representing around US$1 billion in grant financing and leveraging nearly $6 billion in co-financing from the public and private sectors.

FACTS AND FIGURES 

By 2030, the world’s energy consumption is predicted to increase by 30–50 per cent. In developing countries, energy consumed by the industrial sector is frequently in excess of 50 per cent of the national energy supply. 

According to the International Energy Agency, the building sector (commercial and residential) is the biggest consumer of the world’s energy use, at 41 per cent. Industry consumes 31 per cent, while the mobility sector uses 28 per cent.

Globally, the building sector’s final energy consumption doubled between 1971 and 2010 to reach 2,794 million tonnes of oil equivalent, driven primarily by population increase and economic growth. 
Although primary energy demand is expected to increase by about one third by 2030, the energy demand globally is predicted to grow by two-thirds – three times as fast as the world’s population. 
Unless the way we move through cities changes, experts predict a 120 per cent growth of global transport emissions by 2050 (from 2000 levels). Transport-related CO2 emissions are expected to increase 57 per cent worldwide between 2005 and 2030

Energy efficiency measures reduce costs both for the public and private sector. Efficient light bulbs and management can save up to 82 per cent of energy used, while modern boilers can save up to 40 per cent of fuel used.

Adopting energy-efficient technologies could, by 2030, reduce global projected electricity consumption of building and industry by 14 per cent. Investments in energy productivity can contribute to job creation. 

Almost 90% of people in Bangladesh cook with traditional fuels, such as firewood, jute sticks and agriculture waste. In Bhutan, more than 80 per cent of rural households (where 70 per cent of the population resides) are largely dependent on traditional fuels, such as firewood and kerosene. 

The unreliability of energy production and distribution and the cost of fossil fuels impact country finances greatly. Regular power blackouts disrupt industry and lead to reduced and inefficient production and increasing expenses. 

The dependence on imported fossil fuels leaves least developed countries and small island developing States particularly vulnerable to volatile prices. 

From 2012 to 2015, the Global Environment Facility alone channeled $117,629,563 through UNDP to fund 27 climate change mitigation and sustainable energy projects in 14 countries in Asia and the Pacific.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2372064,"As climate threats grow, Iraq battles a new enemy: Water shortages By Laurie Goering

LONDON, Dec 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - After years battling Islamic State militants, Iraqi farmers – many of them military volunteers – are now returning to their homes and fields only to find a new threat: a shortage of water.

Construction of dams and other water-holding facilities in upstream Turkey and Iran, combined with increasingly erratic rainfall across the region, mean the amount of water flowing in key Iraqi rivers has fallen by at least 40 percent in recent decades, said Hassan Janabi, the country's water resources minister.

Damage to Iraq's own dams and other infrastructure from years of fighting - and from a recent earthquake - also is making water supplies more irregular, he said.

While war was raging, water was a secondary concern - but today it is fast becoming a new source of conflict, he said.

Farmers in swathes of southern Iraq have had too little water to plant this winter's wheat crop, leading to demonstrations and increasing anger, the minister said. By next summer, even drinking water may be in short supply in some areas, he warned.

""People are very, very upset,"" Janabi said at a conference on climate change and security issues at The Hague on Tuesday. ""We somehow have a social conflict now.""

Climate change is contributing to worsening security threats around the world, from growing migration to increased militancy, in hotspots from Africa's Lake Chad basin and Mali to Iraq, government and military officials said at the conference in the Netherlands.

But acting effectively on those threats remains a challenge, in large part because doing so often requires bringing together not just different countries but leaders in wide-ranging fields - from peacekeeping to environmental action, food security and migration – who do not usually work together.

""There is a real need to bring together all the different pieces of this puzzle,"" said Janani Vivekananda, a senior advisor on climate change and peacebuilding at adelphi, a German thinktank focused on climate, environment and development issues.

In particular, ""we need to bring in people who think, ‘Climate change? That's not us'"", she said.

**U.S. MILITARY STEPS UP**

In some cases, that is already beginning to happen. The U.S. military, for example, for years has been a leader in looking at security threats from climate change. It has also been altering its own operations – including by reducing its use of fossil fuels and adopting renewable energy – to try to reduce them, experts said.

""There's a willingness now to understand how these trends – water scarcity, changing climate factors, energy resources – are affecting our broader national security and geopolitical situation,"" said Sherri Goodman, a senior adviser for international security at the U.S. Center for Climate and Security, a policy institute with top military experts on its advisory board.

Many Europeans, similarly, are increasingly aware that top priority problems at home – such as dealing with growing flows of migrants – are ""intimately connected"" to security and climate threats elsewhere, said Monika Sie Dhian Ho, the general director of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank on international relations.

""We see how urgent this thing is,"" she said. ""We really need to invest in climate problems to deal with the migration and refugees and the security risks that develop as a consequence of that.""

At the conference, the foreign ministers of the Netherlands, Sweden and Belgium and other participants signed a declaration pledging to work together on a range of security threats.

Those include better coordination of migration and climate change responses, promoting better urban resilience and strengthening climate-sensitive development in Mali, water security in Iraq and risk assessments in the Lake Chad region.

**PARCHED IRAQ**

Janabi, Iraq's water resources minister, said his country and others have been slow to focus on climate change-related threats not only because of other pressing priorities – not least war with Islamic State militants – but because climate pressures often build slowly and are harder to see.

""When the threat is cumulative, people tend to overlook the challenge. But it is not less a threat to the nation and stability,"" he said.

Dealing with growing water security threats, however, has been difficult in a country financially devastated by years of war and by low oil prices, which have cut one of its main sources of income, said Janabi, who oversaw the restoration of Iraq's parched southern marshlands, now a World Heritage listed site.

The minister said fighting in Iraq had damaged significant parts of the country's water infrastructure but his capital investment budget for water infrastructure improvements over the next two years is set at zero, even as demand to solve the country's water shortages soars and the country imports 70 percent of its food.

Solving the problems ultimately may require not just repairs and better use of limited water but negotiating effective water sharing agreements with Turkey and Iran – something that will be a huge challenge in a region where ""geopolitics is an issue"", he said.

2371999,"Afghanistan launches US$71 million initiative to prepare rural communities for climate change December 13 2017, Kabul – The Government of Afghanistan, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Least Developed Countries Fund, has launched a new multi-million dollar project aimed at insulating vulnerable Afghan communities from the worst impacts of climate change.

With a particular focus on women and marginalized groups, the new $US71.1 million project – financed with a $5.6 million grant from the GEF Least Developed Countries Fund and co-financing from the Government of Afghanistan ($5 million), Asian Development Bank ($57 million), World Bank ($2.5 million), and UNDP ($1 million) – will promote community-based preparedness and adaptation in the highly vulnerable provinces of Jawzjan and Nangarhar. 

“Climate change is a real and present threat affecting Afghanistan” said H.E Nasir Ahmad Durrani, Minister for Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL), opening the launch event. “While we have been taking steps to build resilience, under the National Adaptation Programme of Action, this new project represents a leap forward, helping build public awareness of climate change risks, strengthen institutional capacities to respond to the challenges, and critically, involving local communities in decision-making.” 

Over the next five years, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock will lead implementation of the project, with a focus on four main pillars: enhancing gender-sensitive disaster risk reduction in, and by, vulnerable communities; establishing community-based early warning systems; promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices and livelihoods; and working with national, provincial and district-level government institutions to better integrate climate change into planning.

The project will work closely with a range of local institutions, including men and women’s shuras and cooperatives, community-based organizations, civil society organizations and NGOs, to maximize the voice of women, youth and others in decision-making.

Increased frequency and severity of droughts, as well as changes in rainfall, glacial lake outflows and increased flash flood risk, are already evident in Afghanistan.  The human and economic impacts are devastating. 

In 2012, more than 380 disaster incidents – including flooding – were recorded in 195 districts and resulted in 479 deaths and damage to almost 30,000 homes. In 2014, heavy, sustained rainfall in April caused flash floods in 27 districts which resulted in more than 150 deaths and the displacement of approximately 16,000 people.  

It is estimated that 80% of Afghanistan’s economic losses are caused by climate-induced disasters, in combination with extreme winters.

“Around three quarters of Afghans are reliant on agriculture for their income and livelihoods. This renders communities highly vulnerable to climate-driven disasters affecting crops and livestock,” said Mr. Mamoon Khawar, the project manager . “The provinces of Jawzjan and Nangarhar are considered especially vulnerable due to a dependence on rain-fed agriculture, widespread poverty and limited resources to invest in adaptation and risk reduction.  Projections indicate that annual rainfall will continue to decrease, with greater variability between seasons – we must be prepared.”

“With no escape from climate change, building the resilience of local governments and communities is an urgent priority,” said UNDP Country Director, Jocelyn Mason. “This project will help reduce losses and damages resulting from climate-driven disasters; facilitate recovery from climate-shocks; and underpin progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Afghanistan.”

2371449,"EU proposes a modernised partnership with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific countries *European Commission - Press release*

Brussels, 12 December 2017

The European Commission has today presented a recommendation to the Council, including a proposal for negotiating directives. This is an important milestone towards opening negotiations with the countries of the Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States (ACP).

High Representative/Vice-President, Federica Mogherini, stated: ""The EU and the ACP countries represent together more than 100 countries, and more than half of the United Nations member states. Together, we have an important role in shaping the global agenda and international cooperation. As an essential part of our commitment to multilateralism, modernising our ACP-EU partnership will allow us to jointly tackle today's global challenges of building peaceful and resilient states, ensuring respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms, and democratic principles.""

Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, stated: ""Renewing our partnership with the ACP countries is a unique opportunity to shape a true partnership of equals, moving beyond traditional donor-recipient perceptions. Only together can we achieve sustainable development. Only our joint commitment can lead us to tangible results in areas such as economic growth, jobs and investment or climate change and bring forward the sustainable development agenda.""

The recommendation by the Commission sets out the basis and the main orientations for a modernised political partnership between equals. The Commission's ambition is to strongly focus on common interests and values, and to go beyond development policy only.

It focusses on obtaining results in key areas such as democracy and human rights, economic growth and investment, climate change, poverty eradication, peace and security and migration. The Commission also highlights the importance of promoting a multi-stakeholder approach by involving a wide variety of actors in dialogue and cooperation. Today's recommendation draws upon an inclusive consultation process with both EU and ACP stakeholders.

**Background**

In February 2020, the Cotonou Agreement between the members of the Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States, on the one hand, and the European Union and its member states, on the other, will expire. In pursuance of the related provision in the Agreement, negotiations on how to govern future relations have to start not later than August 2018.

The expiry of the agreement and the pursuit of a renewed partnership is a strategic opportunity for the parties to strengthen their longstanding relations and make these responsive to the challenges of a changed global context, focusing on common and intersected interests and shared responsibilities.

On the basis of the joint communication from the Commission and High Representative Mogherini, issued in November 2016, the Foreign Ministers of the EU had an exchange of views on future relations with the ACP countries at the Foreign Affairs Council of May 2017.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2371429,"IACHR Grants Precautionary Measure for the Communities of Cuninico and San Pedro in Loreto, Peru Washington, D.C.—The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) granted a precautionary measure on December 2, 2017, to protect the life and physical integrity of the inhabitants of the communities of Cuninico and San Pedro in Loreto, Peru. The matter is included in an application for precautionary measures presented on behalf of a group of several communities that allegedly have been affected by crude-oil spills in the Peruvian Amazon region, along several stretches of the Norperuano pipeline.

Having analyzed the allegations of fact and law presented by the parties and the information the IACHR obtained during a July 2017 visit to the area, the Commission concluded that the information available shows, prima facie, that the matter meets the requirements of seriousness, urgency, and irreparability set forth in Article 25 of its Rules of Procedure.

In making this determination, the Commission took into account that, according to information presented by the applicants, following an oil spill that took place in 2014, the alleged contamination continues to have effects, notwithstanding the passage of time and measures adopted by the Peruvian State. According to the applicants, this situation can be verified by the presence of certain heavy metals, such as cadmium and mercury, above recommended levels. The IACHR was also informed that these higher-than-recommended levels were verified in some judicial decisions in Peruvian courts. The applicants alleged that various illnesses or afflictions associated with these impacts are consistent with the potential effects of prolonged exposure to such elements, and therefore immediate measures must be adopted to protect their rights.

Consequently, the Commission requested that the State of Peru adopt the necessary measures to protect the life and physical integrity of those who live in the identified communities. This should include conducting the necessary diagnostic medical tests to determine the degree to which the beneficiaries may have been poisoned by heavy metals or other substances, so as to provide appropriate medical care, in line with the applicable international standards in this area. In addition, the State should provide special attention to children as part of this process. The IACHR also asked the State to ensure that the members of the communities have access to potable water that is free of contaminants and to a diet that is nutritionally and culturally appropriate and within the levels considered acceptable by international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Finally, the IACHR asked the State to report on the measures it adopts to mitigate any effects on human health that may result from the sources of risk that led to this precautionary measure. Any measures should be adopted by agreement with the beneficiaries and their representatives.

The granting of the precautionary measure and its adoption by the State do not constitute a prejudging of any eventual petition that may come before the inter-American system alleging violations of rights protected in the American Convention on Human Rights and other applicable instruments.

A principal, autonomous body of the Organization of American States (OAS), the IACHR derives its mandate from the OAS Charter and the American Convention on Human Rights. The Inter-American Commission has a mandate to promote the respect for and defense of human rights in the region and acts as a consultative body to the OAS in this area. The Commission is composed of seven independent members who are elected in an individual capacity by the OAS General Assembly and who do not represent their countries of origin or residence.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2371219,"Global Initiative to Relieve Pressure on Mountains By Becky Heeley

**ROME, Dec 12 2017 (IPS)** - International Mountain Day and the Mountain Partnership’s 15th anniversary coincided on December 11, kicking off a three-day Mountain Partnership Global Meeting at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome.

An initiative of Italy, Switzerland, the UN Environment Programme and FAO, the Mountain Partnership is committed to increasing mountain conservation awareness and rebuilding development and international policies. Along with the Paris climate agreement, the 2013 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes that noone should be left behind.

“Our world needs all our pieces and that includes mountains,” shared Andrew Taber passionately, Executive Director of the Mountain Institute and Chair of the Mountain Partnership Steering Committee.

Sixty countries and 200 civil society organizations pledged to relieve climate, hunger, and migration pressures on mountain ecosystems and communities.

“Yes, mountains are under pressure. Yes, mountains still don’t play the role they need to in their countries, but we must get out of this defensive attitude,” contributed Dominique Kohli, Assistant Director-General of the Federal Office for Agriculture of Switzerland.

This attempt to encourage positivity directed at a global audience was explained further by Thomas Hofer, Coordinator of the Mountain Partnership Secretariat, “The mountain agenda is a global agenda. Each mountain region has its specific vulnerability. There is no overall recipe to address vulnerability, so it needs to be done based on the specific situation. Vulnerability has also to do, ultimately, with political attention to mountains.”

With 1 billion people living in mountains and over half the world’s population dependent on mountains for water, food, and clean energy, the pressures mountains are facing reach across regions. Massive environmental shifts brought on by climate change, natural disasters, and land degradation threaten the abundance of fresh water and other goods cultivated in mountains.

The Himalayas are hugely affected by climate change explained Hofer, “For example, in the Himalayan area, the most prominent concern is climate change. The increase in temperature is 2-3 degrees, or even 3-4 degrees, which is much more than the global average. Glaciers in the mountains are retreating.”

Climate change reduces rainfall. In Kenya, mountain communities face water shortages and difficulties growing food. Kenya has overcome these vulnerabilities by utilizing the Partnership’s Adaptation for Food Security and Ecosystem Resilience in Africa project, which promotes collecting rainwater on roofs and building irrigation systems. Now, male and female farmers store water and can grow food for personal consumption as well as for profit.

Hunger is another major issue faced by mountain people. In Colombia, FAO helped combat hunger by implementing the framework for the Biocarebe Connections project, which along with other initiatives, increased food security through forest restoration programmes.

FAO has successfully worked with Nepal to overcome forest degradation, “Over the last twenty or twenty-five years, Nepal has become a champion in terms of community forestry and handing over the responsibility of forest management to communities has led to a strong improvement of mountain forests which is linked to institutionalization of this by the government,” said Hofer.

Governments recognizing and adopting Mountian Partnership initiatives is crucial to globally combating the myriad of problems mountains face.

As the vulnerability of mountain ecosystems increases, so does migration. Many mountain men migrate to already stressed urban areas to find work leaving behind women and families.

“One and a half million young Nepali men work in the Gulf region. It has a big impact on the livelihoods and social situation of women. Women have to deal with everything; the family, the farm, elderly people,” emphasized Hofer.

To alleviate the burden on mountain women and as incentive, community investment in countries like Nepal and specifically Tajikistan, where almost 30% of the glaciers have melted, the Climate Resilience Financing Facility (CLIMADAPT) gives loans to farmers, households, and entrepreneurs who adopt measures to reduce climate change.

Despite the complex climate, hunger, and migration pressures, “Mountain communities and mountain people are very resilient,” states Hofer.

Even though mountain people are strong and have generations of knowledge that allows them to adapt to climate variances and survive, current hardships are exceeding normal levels.

“It is not that mountain communities now are starting to ask for help, they implement their indigenous strategies to deal with variability, but because of the lack of attention and lack of voice in terms of decision making, when the changes are really strong compared to what they are used to, they get to a certain limit,” explained Hofer.

Mountain people need a platform to speak from within their communities and countries. To relieve the immense pressure on mountain ecosystems and people, which is undoubtedly a global problem, mountain communities must be heard so governments can take united interdisciplinary actions.",4588,"Climate Change and Environment"
2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4589,"Contributions"
2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",4589,"Contributions"

 PRC Secretary General Atty. Oscar Palabyab personally received the donation from Chinese Embassy to the Philippines Counsellor Sun Yi at the PRC National Headquarters in Mandaluyong City on Wednesday. 

 “We are very thankful to the Chinese people for your generosity to the Filipinos. Be rest assured that this amount will be properly accounted for and will go far in providing the urgent needs of those suffering from the recent devastating storm in the Visayas,” Palabyab said. 

 A statement released by the Chinese Embassy website said that the “Chinese side looks forward to the aid lending more strength to the disaster relief efforts on the Philippine side to overcome the difficulties caused by tropical storm Urduja, which has hit the Visayas of the Philippines recently, and help the affected people restore their normal livelihood at an earliest date.” 

 Aside from Palabyab, also present to witness the turnover of the donation are: PRC Assistant Secretary General Elizabeth Zavalla, Chinese Embassy to the Philippines Third Secretary of Political Office Liu Tiantian, PRC Fund Generation Director Genna Mijares, and PRC Communications Manager April Ann Abello-Bulanadi. 

 Since last week, the PRC has been working round-the-clock amidst the Christmas season to provide the needed humanitarian assistance to areas affected by Urduja. 

 The PRC recently deployed a humanitarian caravan, consisting of ambulances, water tanker, water bladders, tap stands, water treatment sets and portable generator sets to Biliran province.

 To address the scarcity of clean water in the area, the PRC set up a 5,000-liter water bladder at the Biliran Provincial Hospital. It also provided anti-tetanus vaccines, as well as food and non-food items such as towels, plastic mats and blankets in Biliran. 

 The PRC also set up 13 welfare desks and provided psychosocial support to 169 individuals. Over 60 individuals were also rescued and transported for medical attention.

 The PRC also distributed hot meals to 8,299 individuals in Northern Samar, Ormoc City, Surigao City, Leyte, Masbate, Eastern Samar, and Camarines Norte. 

 As the foremost humanitarian organization in the country, the PRC operates in 103 chapters across the country together with an estimated of 2 million volunteers nationwide.

2391579,"UAE steers discussion about humanitarian crisis in Horn of Africa with UN partners The United Arab Emirates Mission to the United Nations in New York, in collaboration with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has hosted a briefing to engage Members States in evaluating the humanitarian situation and possible responses in the Horn of Africa. The meeting featured briefings by the UN’s humanitarian heads in Ethiopia, Somalia, and South Sudan.

Humanitarian response and prevention is at the heart of the UAE’s foreign aid and assistance. The UAE is deeply concerned by the different situations in the Horn of Africa, from war to climate change, and is partnering with OCHA to illuminate the options for the UN community and donors to empower these countries and their people to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The humanitarian situations in the three countries continue to cripple their development progress. Drought has pushed Somalia to the brink of famine, as well as threatened lives in many parts of Ethiopia, despite strong government leadership in the 2016 and 2017 drought response. Conflict in South Sudan, worsened by climate change, has caused over 2.3 million people to flee their homes and 1 million people at risk of famine in 2018.

The meeting looked at both funding needs – which are especially acute in South Sudan – as well as innovative options to prevent and mitigate crises. These include techniques like forecast-based financing, which mandates donors to release money for humanitarian action before harsh weather strikes, and the tailoring of programs for specific demographics.

The UAE has provided over $250 million of aid to the three countries and their citizens since 2013, most recently to support Uganda as the host of hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese refugees.",4589,"Contributions"

The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney T.D., and Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development, Mr. Ciarán Cannon, T.D., today announced additional Irish funding of €500,000 towards the humanitarian response in Yemen, now the world's largest crisis, with over 20 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.

This new funding is in addition to €750,000 provided last month and brings Ireland’s total direct humanitarian support to the crisis in Yemen to over €5.3 million this year, and nearly €12.5 million since 2012. In addition, Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated USD $25.6 million to Yemen in 2017. 

Ireland provides this support through the UN-managed Yemen Humanitarian Fund, an approach which allows for the most urgent needs to be met quickly, be they for food, shelter, health or protection for the most vulnerable.

 Announcing the funding, the Tánaiste said:

*“The scale and severity of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is overwhelming, and the suffering of the Yemeni people is increasing every day. A staggering 22.2 million people, or 76% of the population, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, an increase of 1.5 million people since June 2017 alone. The UN has warned that Yemen is now the world’s largest man-made humanitarian crisis, with 17.8 million people food insecure and 8.4 million people at risk of starvation.*

*Basic public services are on the brink of collapse, and the cholera outbreak is of an unprecedented scale. Over 3 million people have fled from their homes, and more than 11 million people are in need of protection, facing serious risks to their safety, well-being and basic rights.*

*Following the launch of a missile from Yemen towards Riyadh on 4 November, the Saudi-led coalition imposed restrictions on humanitarian access in Yemen. Ireland unreservedly condemns missile attacks which endanger civilian lives, including the attack on 13 December. Ireland has also consistently highlighted, in bilateral contacts and at EU level, that humanitarian and commercial access to Yemen is necessary to avoid tragedy on an appalling scale. At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I myself urged stronger EU action in this area, and I am personally committed to following this issue closely*.”

Minister of State Cannon added:

“*The humanitarian needs in Yemen continue to exceed available funding, with the UN Humanitarian Response Plan 61% funded. Ireland remains committed to responding where needs are greatest, and we have consistently provided humanitarian support to the people of Yemen. We will continue to do so in 2018*.”

- Irish Aid is the Government’s overseas assistance programme. It is managed by the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. For further information visit www.irishaid.ie.

- Ireland’s Humanitarian Assistance Policy outlines how Irish Aid saves and protects lives, alleviates suffering and maintains human dignity before, during and in the aftermath of humanitarian crises. 

- The UN OCHA Humanitarian Pooled Funds allocate funding in-country to a broad range of partners, including UN organisations, and national and international NGOs. The Pooled Funds form part of the Humanitarian Response Plan for each country and the funding is allocated to meet critical humanitarian needs ranging from food assistance to protection to livelihoods support.

- Ireland has consistently contributed to the humanitarian response in Yemen. Today’s allocation brings Ireland’s total direct humanitarian support to the crisis in Yemen to over €5.3 million this year, and nearly €12.5 million since 2012. In addition, Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated USD $ 25.6 million to Yemen this year.

- The situation for the Yemeni people will only improve permanently with peaceful resolution of the conflict. Ireland supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.

- Ireland will also continue to support efforts to investigate alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and to hold those found guilty of such violations accountable for their actions. At the UN Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen. This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.

- The situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate rapidly. According to the UN, 22.2 million people, or 76% of the population, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. 17.8 million people are currently food insecure, and this is expected to worsen - the UN has warned that 8.4 million people are at risk of famine. Over three million people have been forced to flee from their homes. Critical basic public services in health, water and sanitation, and education, are on the brink of collapse, with 16 million people lacking access to safe water and sanitation and 16.4 million with no access to adequate healthcare. About 11.3 million people are in need of protection, facing serious risks to their safety, well-being and basic rights.",4589,"Contributions"
2391354,"UNHCR welcomes Britain’s support for South Sudanese refugees in Sudan [EN/AR] **Khartoum, Sudan, 21 December 2017** - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today welcomed a multi-year contribution of £7.5 million (approximately US$9.9 million) spread over three years from the Government of the United Kingdom to respond to the critical needs of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan, and those anticipated to arrive between 2018 and 2020.

UNHCR will use the funds to provide life-saving assistance to respond to the vital needs of the South Sudanese refugees as well as host communities in White Nile; West and South Kordofan; and East and South Darfur in the area of protection, water and sanitation, and education. The funds will also allow UNHCR to procure non-food items, such as blankets, sleeping mats and cooking kits, for this vulnerable population. South Sudanese refugees arrive in Sudan in very poor condition, exhausted after long walks to reach the borders and in urgent need of protection, especially children who have lost or been separated from their families during the journey.

Dr. Christopher Pycroft, Head of the Department for International Development in Sudan, said “The unfolding tragedy in South Sudan has had terrible human consequences. The British people stand by those affected by conflict and famine, and commit to continue to support the hundreds of thousands of women and children who have been forced to flee their own country, by providing them with safety, food and water and a roof over their heads. DFID has committed to provide this assistance over three years to help our partner UNHCR, and the other aid agencies involved, to plan ahead and deliver life-saving assistance on the ground more effectively, and to help ensure that children continue to have access to Education even during this time of crisis.”

The UK has been a major donor to UNHCR in Sudan for years, contributing over £ 14.8 million (around US$ 20.8 million) in the past four years. This has enabled UNHCR to assist refugees in the country and has greatly contributed to supporting the South Sudan response since the early days of the crisis.  
Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR’s Representative in Sudan particularly welcomed this multi-year agreement and said: “The United Kingdom has consistently demonstrated its commitment to UNHCR activities to assist the most vulnerable children and people from South Sudan. In an operational context that can change very quickly, this multi-year funding will give more predictability and flexibility to UNHCR to respond more efficiently and at scale when a crisis hits and help respond to expected needs in 2018 as part of our contingency planning”.

To date, close to 453,000 South Sudanese have crossed into Sudan since December 2013, and are now residing across 9 states, in addition with an estimated 350,000 remaining in Sudan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.

Sudan continues to open its borders to refugees seeking safety in the country, which is critical as the conflict in South Sudan is becoming ever more complex in parallel with a worsening food security situation.

2391279,"New Zealand commits 1 million NZD to help UNFPA meet the humanitarian needs of women and girls amid the Rohingya crisis Cox’s Bazar 23 December 2017 - The New Zealand government has committed 1 million NZD to help UNFPA address the sexual and reproductive health and protection needs of women and girls, and to aid survivors of gender-based violence amid the Rohingya humanitarian response.

Since the 25th of August, 655,000 Rohingya refugees have entered Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh from neighbouring Rakhine State in Myanmar. Now four months into the crisis, the needs on the ground – for shelter, food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare and protection – remain staggering. And the unique health and safety needs of women and girls – who represent over half of arrivals – compounded and far from being met.

More than 30,000 women among the new arrivals are pregnant, and almost 11,000 are expected to give birth by the end of February 2018. Nearly 1,500 are at risk of life-threatening pregnancy complications and need access to functioning health facilities for delivery.

Overcrowding and limited privacy across the camps and settlement areas have heightened risks of gender-based violence and exploitation for women and girls. Up to one in five Rohingya refugee families are female-headed, exhibiting even greater vulnerability.

The New Zealand government’s funding commitment recognizes that women and girls are particularly impacted by the crisis. “We commend UNFPA’s tireless efforts to support women and girls impacted by the Rohingya refugee crisis,” said Craig John Hawke, Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations. “We recognize the important role UNFPA plays in delivering lifesaving sexual and reproductive health care and safeguarding the rights of women and girls and we are pleased to support these efforts.”

UNFPA is working in partnership with the Bangladesh Government, UN agencies, and international and local organizations to meet the health and protection needs of the most vulnerable women and girls in Cox’s Bazar, including Rohingya refugees and host communities. Iori Kato, Acting Representative of UNFPA Bangladesh lauds New Zealand’s timely support to scale up the response. “Currently, there is no end in sight to this crisis. With more women and girls arriving from Myanmar by the day, this funding is crucial for the scale up of our lifesaving reproductive health and gender-based violence prevention and response services. We are grateful for the Government of New Zealand’s show of leadership, helping to ensure women and girls are not left behind in this response.”

2391269,"Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee Awarded $100 Million for Early Childhood Education of Syrian Refugees Three Finalists Awarded $15 Million Each in Global Competition for Bold Solutions to Critical Problems of Our Time

Chicago, Illinois, December 20, 2017 — The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation today awarded a $100 million grant to [Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee (IRC)](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/2017/) to educate young children displaced by conflict and persecution in the Middle East. 

The Foundation’s Board, deliberating among four finalists in *[100&Change](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/)*, MacArthur’s global competition for bold solutions to critical problems of our time, decided to award additional grants of $15 million to each of the other three finalists, based on the strength and potential impact of their proposals. The Foundation remains committed to helping the finalists attract the additional support their critical work requires. 

Sesame Workshop and IRC will use the $100 million grant to implement an evidence-based, early childhood development intervention designed to address the “toxic stress” experienced by children in the Syrian response region—Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria. The project will improve children’s learning outcomes today and their intellectual and emotional development over the long term. 

“We are compelled to respond to the urgent Syrian refugee crisis by supporting what will be the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting,” said MacArthur President Julia Stasch. “Less than two percent of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children. The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education.”

Each of the project’s three components is designed in consultation with local child development and curriculum experts, and each will help caregivers restore nurturing relationships and give their children the tools they need to overcome the trauma of conflict and displacement.

- Customized educational content and a new local version of Sesame Street – Delivered through television, mobile phones, digital platforms, and direct services in homes and communities, pan-Arab content will help provide an estimated 9.4 million young children the language, reading, math, and socioemotional skills they need to succeed in school and later in life. Embedded in the content, Sesame’s Muppets will model inclusion and respect, and gender equity, and they will provide engaging educational messages, always from a child’s perspective. All the content that is created will ultimately be publicly available at no cost. 

- Home visits reinforced with digital content – Home visitation and caregiving support sessions will connect trained local outreach and community health workers to 800,000 caregivers. Home visit content will promote caregiver responsiveness, early learning, mental well-being, and resiliency. The content will engage families through storybooks and picture books, parent brochures, caregiver guides, toys, developmentally appropriate games, digital content, and parenting resources via mobile devices. Direct services in homes and centers will reach 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children. 

- Child development centers – Sesame and IRC will transform community sites, formal and informal schools, and other points of aid into nurturing care and learning centers. Centers will be equipped with storybooks, video clips on pre-loaded projectors, activity sheets, and training guides to enable age-appropriate, play-based learning. 

“The Syrian refugee crisis is the humanitarian issue of our time and we are deeply grateful for this incredible opportunity,” said Jeffrey D. Dunn, President & CEO of Sesame Workshop. “For almost 50 years, Sesame has worked around the world to improve the lives of children and help them to grow smarter, stronger and kinder. This may be our most important initiative ever and we are humbled by the trust and confidence that has been placed in us. These children are, arguably, the world’s most vulnerable and by improving their lives we create a more stable and secure world for us all.”

Sesame Workshop has a long record of developing local versions of Sesame Street in places like Bangladesh, India, Afghanistan and South Africa. And the IRC brings its long and deep engagement in the refugee community and an established network of community workers and local facilities to the partnership. Sesame and IRC will receive the $100 million grant over five years and in accordance with established milestones that ensure the project remains on track. The success of the project will encourage a redirection of existing humanitarian aid, excite new donors, and provide a working model for local government support.

David Miliband, President and CEO of IRC, called the 100&Change grant “a transformational investment that will bring hope and opportunity to a generation of refugee children. This MacArthur grant will create a model for investment in early childhood services around the world. IRC’s partnership with Sesame is an incredible validation of our determination to put education center-stage in humanitarian settings. I hope the new kind of philanthropic thinking embodied by this grant will be an inspiration to others seeking to tackle the world’s largest problems. At a time when governments are in retreat, NGOs and philanthropists need to step up, and that is what we are seeing here – and in a big way.” 

The 100&Change finalists receiving grants of $15 million each over five years are:

- [Catholic Relief Services](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/catholic-relief-services/) – changing how society cares for children in orphanages; 

- [HarvestPlus](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/harvestplus/) – eliminating hidden hunger in Africa by fortifying staple crops; and 

- [Rice 360° Institute for Global Health (Rice University)](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/rice-360-institute-global-health-rice-university/) – improving newborn survival in Africa. 

“Collectively, these projects identify the opportunity for action to improve long-term prospects for the world’s children. They propose feasible and durable solutions to remediate the effects of family and community disruption, the lack of dietary diversity, and premature birth. All four projects proved worthy of MacArthur’s support,” said Cecilia Conrad, MacArthur’s Managing Director who leads 100&Change. “MacArthur is deeply committed to helping all of them attract the support their critical work requires and finding partners to realize these impactful solutions.”

To help draw attention to and support for the many strong proposals submitted to the competition, MacArthur partnered with Foundation Center to develop the [*100&Change* Solutions Bank](http://100andchange.foundationcenter.org/), a website where nonprofits can find collaborators and funders can search for projects in which to invest. The Solutions Bank is searchable by topics such as geography, subject, strategy, population served, sustainable development goal alignment, and linked research. MacArthur also supported the Center for High Impact Philanthropy (CHIP) at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy & Practice, which analyzed the [top 200](http://100andchange.org/#results/top200) scoring proposals using its lens of social impact. CHIP’s “[Bold Ideas for Philanthropists to Drive Social Change](https://www.impact.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CHIP1217_BoldIdeas_Final.pdf)” guide showcases 81 proposals that stood out for the clarity of their goal and the logic of their proposed solution. Eleven “best bets” were highlighted as having the greatest potential for impact. Third, MacArthur worked closely with [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5027), which identified *100&Change* participants that it rated with four stars, and shared its analysis with its broad audience of individual donors.

*100&Change* is a distinctive competition that invited proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location. There was [robust participation](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/update-100change-robust-participation/): 7,069 competition registrants submitted 1,904 proposals. Of those, 801 passed an initial [administrative review](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/update-100change-applications/) and were evaluated by a [panel of judges](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/panel-wise-heads/) who each provided ratings on [four criteria](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/100change-judging-criteria/): meaningfulness, verifiability, durability, and feasibility.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of millions of vulnerable people across sub-Saharan Africa, including women and children suffering from a lack of access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their daily needs —the result of severe drought and conflict.

On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Ambassador Marc-André Blanchard, Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations, today announced $19.8 million in additional funding to address extreme levels of food insecurity in Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan and Uganda.

In these seven countries and neighbouring regions, Canada’s funding of experienced and trusted Canadian and international partners will respond to critical humanitarian needs. This includes the provision of basic necessities, such as emergency food, potable water, adequate sanitation, health care, shelter and protection services. 

**Quotes**

“Canada is pleased to provide critical humanitarian assistance to address the effects of drought and conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa and to ensure those requiring emergency assistance are reached. Today’s announcement will help save lives, alleviate suffering and bring relief to people who need urgent help.”

2390649,"The European Union donates an additional EUR 10.5 million to UNRWA at a crucial time for Palestine refugees The European Union (EU) has announced an additional, vital contribution of EUR 10.5 million to the 2017 Programme Budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), in support of education, access to health care, employment opportunities, and improved living conditions for millions of Palestine refugees.

This donation complements nearly five decades of steadfast EU support of Palestine refugees. This year, in particular, the European Union and UNRWA have launched the unique _Healthy Living, Healthy Spaces_ (HLHS) campaign, targeting 50 EU-sponsored UNRWA schools and 15 health centers for repair and rehabilitation across Lebanon, Gaza, West Bank and Jordan fields. Both [the HLHS initiative](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-and-eu-celebrate-launch-project-improve-unrwa-health-and-educational) and latest contribution stand as a testament to the strong EU and UNRWA partnership for Palestine refugees.

In recognition of the contribution, Pierre Krähenbühl, UNRWA Commissioner-General, stated: “Giving some half million students in UNRWA schools across the Middle East a sense of dignity and preserving their opportunities is particularly urgent at a time when the spaces in which they can develop and enjoy a normal childhood are shrinking so dramatically. This is particularly important in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in Gaza and in Syria. In these contexts, the support we receive from the EU is of critical significance.”

""With this contribution, the EU support to the regular UNRWA budget in 2017 has reached EUR 102 million. This support allows millions of Palestine refugees to receive access to education, health and other social services. These services are crucial for sustaining hope amid a tough reality,"" said EU Representative Ralph Tarraf. ""In its five fields of operations, UNRWA is contributing to stability in the face of enormous new challenges. The EU will continue to support this effort until a just and agreed-upon solution is found for Palestine refugees. This is an essential element of the EU strategy to maintain peace in the region,"" he added. 

The European Union is the Agency’s largest multi-lateral donor, with an overall yearly contribution amounting to 12.5 per cent of the total programme support. This latest donation brings the EU contributions to EUR 102 million for 2017, including EUR 82 million disbursed earlier in the year and the additional contribution of EUR 9.5 million announced this past September.

**EU AND UNRWA: TOGETHER FOR PALESTINE REFUGEES**

Since 1971, the European Union and UNRWA have maintained a strategic partnership governed by the shared objective to support the human development, humanitarian and protection needs of Palestine refugees and promote stability in the Middle East. Today, the European Union is the largest multilateral provider of international assistance to Palestine refugees. This reliable and predictable support from the European Union enables UNRWA to provide core services to more than 5 million Palestine refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, including quality education for roughly half a million children and primary health care for more than 3.5 million patients.

Collectively, the EU and its Member States are also among the largest contributors to the Agency’s humanitarian emergency appeals and projects in response to various crises and specific needs across the region. The partnership between the European Union and UNRWA has allowed millions of Palestine refugees to be better educated, live healthier lives, access employment opportunities and improve their living conditions, thus contributing to the development of the entire region.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. As a result, the UNRWA Programme Budget, which supports the delivery of core essential services, operates with a large shortfall. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

UNRWA is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees. Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight. UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection and microfinance.

2390024,"North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, November 2017 **Operational Overview**

The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains severe due to ongoing conflict, continued internal displacement and the unpredictable return of refugees from neighbouring countries. New population movements continued to be recorded in November, with 1,862 new arrivals in Gwoza, followed by 729 in Askira/Uba, 428 in Mafa, 373 in Ngala and 358 in Madagali; Jere and Chibok recorded relatively high numbers of departures. Additionally, recent important and unexpected arrivals of population (over 13,000 persons) were recorded in Nganzai, Konduga and Magumeri where there is very limited partner presence due to insecurity and lack of access. Humanitarian agencies mobilised to address to the most urgent needs, in particular through the rapid response mechanism (RRM), filling the most pressing gaps until sectors can plan and deliver a comprehensive response.  

While food security has improved throughout the north-east in 2017 as a result of a massive scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihoods assistance, the situation remains extremely fragile with many households, particularly in Borno State, mainly dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic food and livelihood needs. Many remain forced to resort to negative coping strategies to access food. The most recent Cadre Harmonisé analysis (finalised in November) projects that, without adequate and timely humanitarian assistance, 3.7 million individuals will be facing critical levels of food insecurity during the 2018 lean season (June through September). The figure does not include four Borno State local government areas (LGAs) where data could not be collected due to access constraints (in Abadam, Guzamala and Marte) or lack of partner capacity (in Kala/Balge).  

In addition to food insecurity, issues of protection continue to cause extremely serious concern throughout the north-east, including person-borne explosive device attacks in or near IDP camps, and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of internally displaced persons (IDPs) by those supposed to protect them, as was reported in Bama (Borno State). In addition, on 1 November, four pupils in a primary school in Kwaya Kusar, Borno State, were gruesomely attacked. Two of them died and the other two were severely wounded. This direct attack against an educational institution, the first one in two years, may impact school attendance as parents may fear for their children’s lives. In addition, following the resurgence of attacks by non-state armed groups in some parts of Adamawa State, 12 primary schools have been closed, affecting education continuity for the children enrolled in those schools.  

The dry season has also allowed the work on ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs to accelerate and, to date, five out of the nine planned hubs are complete (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza). Another four (Monguno, Damasak, Banki and Rann) are expected to be fully operational by early 2018. As these hubs offer secure accommodation and Internet connectivity for aid workers, they are instrumental in supporting effective last-mile aid delivery and enhancing local coordination.  

With close to 70 per cent (US$731 million out of $1.05 billion) of the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) funding requirements received before year-end, the humanitarian response in Nigeria is one of the world’s best funded. Thanks to the generous support of donors, many sectors have been able to meet their targets on key life-saving activities. However, a critical gap remained throughout the year in the funding of the Response and Recovery Planning sector. This has hampered the humanitarian agencies’ ability to deliver comprehensive livelihood support to affected people, has slowed down debris removal activities in major towns, and overall limited early recovery work across north-east Nigeria.  

As the year draws to a close, sectors and humanitarian organisations continued to carry out various programme-based and areabased needs assessments which are contributing to drafting the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan, to be finalised respectively by mid-December and early January.",4589,"Contributions"

2389669,"IOM, Italy Broaden Stabilization Efforts for Conflict-Affected Communities in Iraq [EN/AR] Iraq – After the end of the successful first phase of the IOM Iraq - Italian Government partnership to strengthen community stabilization initiatives in Diyala Governorate (between August 2016 to November 2017), a new project has been launched to support the psychosocial well-being of vulnerable displaced women in Dohuk and Ninewa governorates.

Funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), the one-year project, with a budget of half a million euros, will enable IOM Iraq to empower vulnerable women who have been affected by conflict, including through the provision of livelihood support. 

The project will aim to involve 1,000 women, including from ethno-religious minorities; especially Yazidis –considered one of the most vulnerable communities of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq. 

The Yazidi community is mostly concentrated in northern Iraq. Its members, especially women, went through ordeals when ISIL swept into their areas, beginning in 2014 and seized large swathes of territory, killing and enslaving thousands of Yazidis.

“The active participation of women is essential to reach sustainable peace and community stabilization. This livelihood training will assist vulnerable women to strengthen their skills and allow them to support themselves and their families. We are pleased to provide support, especially during this time of transition, as families continue to recover from devastating conflict,” said Bruno Antonio Pasquino, Italian Ambassador to Iraq. 

“Gender and minorities are the two traditional focal points of the Italian activities in the field of development cooperation,” Ambassador Pasquino added. 

In addition to individual livelihood support for women, the project will provide a dozen grassroots local civil society organizations (CSOs) with training and follow-up coaching to address the essential psychosocial needs of community members, in partnership with Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government authorities including the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Health.

The training courses will cover a broad range of topics such as psychosocial support and social cohesion, enhancing CSOs management and networking skills, as well as providing beneficiaries with entrepreneurial livelihood support by creating self-help groups to improve interactions, social cohesion, and confidence among them. 

“Engaging local CSOs will enable us to transfer the experience we gained over the last three years in providing psychosocial support in emergency contexts, and prepare the community-based partners to take the lead in providing psychosocial services,” said Renato Libanora of IOM Iraq’s psychosocial support team.  
The project in Dohuk and Ninewa builds on the similar recently completed project that IOM implemented in Diyala, in partnership with AICS.

Khalida Nouri of Khanaqin, one of Diyala project’s participants, says that the project economically empowered dozens of women by teaching them sewing skills. 

“About 44 women participated in the course I taught; they were mostly displaced from their homes, and included Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen,” she said. 

“The course’s contents and the interaction among us made me more confident. I learned many things; since taking this course I have become more self-sufficient. I also had an opportunity to learn about other people’s traditions and lifestyles,” Nouri said. 

Nouri added that she is still in contact with a number of participants who opened small sewing businesses, either at home or in shops, thanks to the skills they learned in the course. Nouri said that there are now nearly 500 applicants who want to enroll in this course to be able to help themselves and their families.

According to the latest Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) figures, since January 2014, more than 2.9 million Iraqis are still displaced This includes 941,000 in Ninewa 360,000 in Dohuk and nearly 83,000 in Diyala governorate. More than 2.7 million of formerly displaced Iraqis have returned to their place of origin.

2.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid

Over 633 300 internally displaced and 545 497 CAR refugees in neighbouring countries (UNHCR)

1.4 million people food insecure

EU humanitarian funding:            
€22.5 million in 2017                
€136 million since 2013 

**Introduction**

More than four years after the crisis broke out in December 2013, the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) remains extremely serious. Humanitarian needs are on the rise and have reached a level similar to the peak of the crisis in 2013-2014. Fourteen humanitarian workers have been killed so far this year, which makes CAR the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarians after Syria. In November, international aid organisations in some areas in the north suspended their activities and evacuated all their staff.

**What are the needs?**

Some 2.2 million people in the country – almost half of the population – are in need of humanitarian assistance. Around 1.4 million people are food insecure. Chronic malnutrition has increased and is currently among the highest in the world (around 40% of the under 5-year old population according to UNICEF). Communities' stocks are empty and livelihoods have been severely affected by fighting and looting, provoking substantial increases in food prices and a substantial decrease in household income. The situation of the still very high number of internally displaced is of particular concern. 

The weak national health system has collapsed due to widespread violence. There is also a severe shortage of skilled health workers and medical supplies. Up to 58% of health infrastructures are supported by humanitarian actors. This lack of access to basic healthcare continues to have serious repercussions for the population. Needs in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are particularly severe in the areas most affected by the conflict and maintaining an adequate level of WASH remains a challenge, especially in internally displaced person's (IDP) sites. Safe drinking water is scarce. 

The crisis has also spilled over into neighbouring countries (in particular in Chad and Cameroon) and the effects are considerable, notably in terms of pressure on local resources.

**How are we helping?**

With over €400 million provided since 2014, the European Union (Commission + Member States) is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to CAR. The European Commission alone has provided €136 million in humanitarian aid inside the country since December 2013, in addition to over €83 million for Central African refugees in neighbouring countries.  

The spill-over over the crisis to neighbouring countries has been significant, with the refugee situation becoming protracted. Humanitarian needs created by the CAR conflict, including in bordering Cameroon and Chad, are therefore considered a forgotten humanitarian crisis by the European Commission.  

The Commission's humanitarian assistance primarily targets needs in the areas of food, health, emergency shelter, water, sanitation and protection of civilians. Relief assistance is focused on displaced people both inside and outside IDP camps, as well as on refugees who mostly rely on humanitarian assistance to cover their needs. Support to operations (coordination, air services) is also crucial.  

The Commission also funds humanitarian projects to enable free access to primary health care services through mobile clinics, with a main focus on life-saving interventions and the control of epidemic-prone infectious diseases. Projects seeking to improve the protection of civilians are also being supported, including tracking of incidents, medical, psychosocial and legal support to victims, as well as actions offering a protective environment for children. 
 
In 2017, the European Commission has also supported the UN humanitarian air services (UNHAS) in order to facilitate the transport of humanitarian personnel to remote locations which would otherwise remain inaccessible due to insecurity and very poor infrastructure.",4589,"Contributions"

Nearly 80 percent of United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) funding for Yemen this year has been provided by the United States, Germany, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, with the US providing the largest single amount (US$386 million).

“We are more than 1,000 days into the Yemen crisis, and the only way we’re able to continue to offer assistance for millions of Yemenis is due to the generosity of a handful of dedicated countries,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “The people of these countries and their governments are saving lives in Yemen every day, and we say a heartfelt ‘thank you’ for their support. But the situation remains desperate, so we need more governments to provide funding immediately so we can keep people alive. And most importantly, we call for an end to the conflict that is causing this catastrophe.”

Additional significant contributions to WFP operations in Yemen this year have come from Japan, UN Funds and Agencies, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), Saudi Arabia, Norway and Canada. CERF receives broad support from UN Member States, with Germany, Sweden, the UK, Netherlands and Norway topping its list of donors in 2017.

Despite the generosity of these donors, WFP operations in Yemen require an additional US$277 million to provide food assistance through June next year. Since August, WFP has provided food assistance to seven million people, but around half of these people received a mere 60% of their rations due to funding constraints.

More aid will also be granted for the acute crises in Africa. Finland will support Northeast Nigeria with EUR 1.5 million through the UNHCR. In addition, EUR 750,000 will be directed to Ethiopia through the WFP and EUR 1 million to the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Congo, as many as 3.8 million people have had to flee from conflicts and currently the country has one of the fastest growing humanitarian crises in the world.

In addition, Finland will grant EUR 8 million of general aid for the WFP. The WFP can flexibly decide on allocating general aid, which often improves the cost-efficiency and speed of the aid.

With the new aid, the amount of humanitarian aid that Finland has granted in 2017 will total EUR 81.3 million. Approximately one third of this is general aid, one third directed to humanitarian action in the Middle East and slightly less than one third to Africa. In addition, Finland has supported humanitarian work in Afghanistan, Myanmar, North Korea and Ukraine.

Among other things, in thematic issues, Finland has hosted a conference on aid to Syria and promoted the position of the disabled in humanitarian action and the development of flexible forms of funding during this year.

The humanitarian situation in the world has deteriorated during 2017. According to the UN’s recent estimates, 136 million people are now in need of humanitarian aid and protection. In spite of the ever-growing need, more aid has been delivered this year than ever before, which has saved millions of lives in different parts of the world.

2388324,"Syria: Complex Emergency appeal operations update n°MDRSY003  Operations update n°14 This operations update provides a summary of key results achieved against objectives of the IFRC Syria Complex Emergency Appeal from 01 January 2017 until November 2017. As of October 2017, the number of people in Syria affected by the crisis, in urgent need of humanitarian assistance is still more than 13 million. 

This Operations Update extends the timeframe of of the Emergency Appeal (MDRSY003) until 31 December 2018 in order to continue supporting the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) in providing life- saving assistance to conflict-affected people in Syria. 

The plan and budget for the Emergency Appeal will be revised in the first quarter of 2018, based on a comprehensive review of the operation that will begin in January. The review will analyse the relevance, effectiveness and overall quality of the Emergency Appeal response to date, consider lessons learned and provide a roadmap for the future of IFRC support for the coming years. 

The 2017 operational budget of CHF 49.7 million is 72% funded, thanks to the continued efforts of the IFRC partners. Yet, the IFRC Syria operational plan and budget have a significant funding gap of CHF 13.9 million for objectives that remain highly relevant in 2018, and are in line with SARC’s priorities for response, recovery and the requisite institutional capacity. 

With this 12-month extension, IFRC will continue to mobilize resources towards the targets outlined in the current plan and budget. Current urgent funding priorities are to secure an ongoing supply of relief contingency stocks, medical stocks, and sustained capacity of the IFRC Syria office structure in 2018.   
 
Partners are encouraged to make funding commitments for the 2018 period, and contribute towards the immediate funding priorities to facilitate a timely procurement and operational priorities towards the beginning of 2018 2017 was characterized by institutional and operational reorganization for both the IFRC Syria office and for SARC. IFRC adjusted its strategies and operational approaches to overcome the challenges with the import of relief and medical stocks which continued from 2016 hindering the IFRC implementation levels during the first months of 2017. Positive outcomes mid-2017 continue to boost operational progress in the second half of the year.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**   

The IOM DTM Round XIX (October 2017) estimates that a total of 1.57 million people remain internally displaced across the three northeast states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 85 per cent are in Borno alone. This represents a decrease of about 3 per cent as compared to Round XVIII (August 2017). The reduction is explained by the movement of people to the newly accessible areas in Borno State. Children represent 56 per cent of the total IDP population.  
During the reporting period, a total of 2,641 new arrivals were registered in 16 LGAs in Borno and 4 LGAs in Adamawa (IOM DTM ETT Report: No. 39; No.40). These ongoing arrivals are increasing the pressure on the delivery of humanitarian services in the IDP settlements in terms of shelter, health and nutrition, provision of food and access to sanitation. With the upcoming dry season and improved road access, it is expected that hostilities will intensify leading to increased population displacement.  
The number of cholera cases continued to decrease during the reporting period and as of 15th November 2017, the total number of confirmed and suspected cholera cases reached 5,340, with 61 deaths (CFR = 1.1 per cent): 2,686 cases in the Muna corridor (Jere LGA); 1,758 cases in Monguno and 82 cases in Guzamala. The total number of cases reported from Dikwa, MMC and Mafa stand at 736, 58 and 20 respectively and have remained so for over 3 weeks.

2388279,"UNICEF Syria Crisis Situation Report (Humanitarian Results) - November 2017 **Highlights**

- As of 18 December 2017, the UNICEF 2017/18 winter response in Syria and Syrian refugee host countries reached over 630,000 children but remains 58% underfunded (out of US$72 million appeal) and 880,000 children remain in dire need for support.

- In Syria, the escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta and limited access of humanitarian deliveries and commercial goods has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, half of them children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since January 2017. In the same month, UNICEF reached more than 340,000 people in hard-to-reach locations (including 27,000 people in besieged locations) with life-saving interventions and critical services in the areas of WASH, education, health and nutrition and child protection.

- In November in Turkey, over 167,000 Syrian refugee children benefitted from the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education (CCTE) for attending school regularly in preceding months, a nearly 22% increase in beneficiaries over the previous payment in September. Approximately 82% of children receiving the CCTE in November also benefitted from the Emergency Social Safety Net programme, which helped reach close to 1.1 million refugees to date.

- In Lebanon, UNICEF WASH response to 190,000 people living in informal settlements (population of 272,000) is facing a critical funding shortage of US$ 26.5 million to sustain services beyond April 2018. To pre-empt the funding shortfall, a shift from full service coverage is being undertaken to mainly focus on the most vulnerable, semi-temporary costeffective water and wastewater facilities, and the establishment of a surveillance mechanism to identify possible communicable disease outbreak and trigger an immediate Health and WASH joint response.

- The number of unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) in Egypt has increased to nearly 2,500 in 2017 compared to 1,800 last year including some Syrian refugees. Key needs identified for this highly vulnerable group include legal documentation, legal support, cash assistance, education and child protection services. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs:** Humanitarian needs remained critical in Syria throughout November. Though the overall level of violence decreased in some areas of the country (primarily those linked to de-escalation zones in southern Syria, northern Homs), violence escalated and or remained high elsewhere such as in Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Raqqa and Deir-Ez-Zour where fighting and anti-ISIL operations continue to inflict high civilian casualties. The escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta along with limited access of humanitarian and commercial shipments has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, especially children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since the last survey conducted in January 20171 . 

Furthermore, fighting between armed opposition groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Nour al-Din al-Zenki (NDZ) led to the disruption of humanitarian services in western rural Aleppo. Some humanitarian services were suspended from November 14 to 18 over concerns for the security of staff. Clashes between non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and the Government of Syria resulted in shelling in southern rural Aleppo, triggering a displacement of more than 10,000 residents and 2,600 internally displaced people (IDPs)2 . 

A rise in military clashes led to a displacement of more than 90,000 IDPs from As-Saan, Hamra and Oqierbat in Hama governorate and Tamanah in southern Idleb to move northward into Idleb governorate in the past two months.3 In Raqqa, displaced populations are returning to areas with a high prevalence of unexploded ordinances and landmines. Humanitarian partners estimate more than 200 related trauma cases since cessation of military activities in Raqqa City, particularly among children, highlighting the importance of scalingup life-saving mine risk education in prior active conflict zones. The destruction of education and health4 infrastructure along with further attacks and internal displacement continues to limit access to these essential services for children throughout the country. Subsequently, an estimated 1.7 million children remain out-of-school and 200,000 others have missed-out on basic immunization and polio. 

In total, Jordan now hosts 2.7 million refugees, including 655,588 registered Syrian refugees (51 per cent children)5 . A population of approximately 40,000 Syrians remain along Jordan’s northeast desert border near Rukban, of whom 80 per cent are estimated to be women and children, with a significant percentage of households headed by females. Since the closure of the border in June 2016, only modest support has been possible from the Jordanian side of the berm, including the provision of safe water and access to basic health services, primarily through the UN and in close coordination with the Jordanian Armed Forces. The UNICEF-supported clinic near Rukban has provided around 500 medical consultations in November, a decrease from services provided in the previous month (1,002 consultations) due to limited access. The daily provision of safe water by UNICEF and access to some health services remain the only regular humanitarian assistance available for the vulnerable population at the Berm. 

Reports of minor clashes between Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) armed forces (Peshmerga), Iraq Security Forces (ISF) and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) continued in the reporting month, albeit no significant displacement. As in the previous month, armed conflict remained largely far from Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) areas where Syrian refugees reside. There has been no resolution to ongoing political tension between the KRG in Erbil and the federal Government of Iraq since the referendum on the former’s independence in September, however political dialogue is ongoing. As of November, Iraq is hosting 246,974 registered Syrian refugees including over 107,187 children 6 . Although overall numbers have remained largely static, movements continue between Syria and Iraq at the Peshkhabour border crossing. Per information received from border authorities, some 5,100 Syrians arrived in the KRI in September alone, of these, more than 3,800 were readmittances after prior authorization by border authorities to return to Syria.7 The humanitarian situation of Syrian refugees in Iraq has remained largely the same throughout 2017. With around 40 per cent of Syrian refugees under 18, the need for access to formal education remains high. Although Syrian refugees in camps remain well served, Syrian refugees in host communities may not have regular access to primary healthcare, regular safe water supply or adequate sanitation. In this prolonged refugee crisis, there is need to identify and strengthen community-based child protection networks to identify child protection issues and advocate for child-focused solutions. 

Lebanon continues to host an estimated 1.5 million refugees (over one million registered with UNHCR8 ). The sudden resignation of the Prime Minister Saad Hariri on 4 November heightened the sense of an impending crisis. While the situation normalized with his return to Lebanon, the incident exposed a precarious political context and its potential impact on the region. UNICEF continues to face critical funding shortages in Informal Settlements (US$26.5 million gap) to meet the needs of 190,000 people (estimated population of 272,000) for WASH as well as for Health (US$ 2.8 million gap). Given the expected decrease in humanitarian funding next year, UNICEF is transitioning towards strategic and longer-term systems strengthening in the areas of the No Lost Generation initiatives (child protection, youth, education and social protection) as well as child survival (health and WASH), while maintaining a more durable humanitarian response in light of ongoing needs and current instability.  
In November, nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, including over 1.5 million children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.9 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, 2,052 refugees and migrants were rescued or apprehended on their sea journey from Turkey to Greece, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece. Under the framework of the EU-Turkey Statement, seven rounds of returns took place for 75 people in November (including two accompanied children)10, bringing the total number of readmissions to 1,469 since the Statement came into effect in March 2016. 

In Egypt, the total number of registered Syrian refugees and asylum seekers has reached over 124,000, an increase from the 117,591 registered in January 2017. Forty per cent of new Syrian arrivals are coming illegally from the Sudanese border leading to an increased number of detentions. UNICEF has access to the 23 detention centres where it provides health assistance, including vaccines, hygiene kits and non-food items, with a focus on young and adolescent girls. 

The Government of Egypt grants Syrian refugee children access to education in public schools under the same rules and regulations that apply to Egyptian nationals. However, absorbing the number of Syrian students in public schools is a persistent constraint due to high class density and limited number of teachers relative to students. Other challenges to enrolment include strict documentation requirements, safety measures (inside and outside classrooms) and lack of quality teaching in public schools. Currently, an estimated 39,000 children remain out-of-school. The number of unaccompanied and separated children has increased to about 2,50011 compared to 1,800 last year. Key needs include issuance of legal documentation to help qualify for legal support and cash assistance, in addition to education, child protection services.",4589,"Contributions"
2388119,"European Union–UN Women partnership bolsters efforts in response to Syrian crisis _EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis steps up its support to women’s empowerment in Jordan, Iraq and Turkey through a EUR 12.5 million investment._

Date: Thursday, December 21, 2017

Pursuing joint efforts against gender-based violence, the European Union (EU) and UN Women today launched a women’s rights and empowerment programme aimed at strengthening the resilience of Syrian women and girls and host communities in Iraq, Jordan and Turkey. This is the first agreement with UN Women under the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis, the “Madad Fund”.

This integrated programme aims to reach 60,000 people in need, predominantly women living in situations characterized by increasing domestic violence, isolation and economic insecurity. It will address economic vulnerability and violence by increasing women’s access to financial assets and recovery and income opportunities, while providing immediate and life-saving protection services.

Placing women and women’s organizations at the forefront of the regional response to the Syrian crisis and with a long-term view, the programme focuses both on improving service delivery with efforts to enhance women’s representation and rights, and strengthening national accountability for addressing violence against women. By bringing together different communities and creating spaces for dialogue, the programme seeks to build cohesion for more peaceful societies.

The programme will support women like Rana, who is living in an informal settlement in Iraq, after losing her home, many of her family members, and the life she knew. As the head of her family, Rana is receiving services from a UN Women–supported safe space, while contributing to her community.

“I always look forward to going into the UN Women centre in my area; it is my second home”, says Rana. “It gives me a community to belong to, a sense of purpose and a place for my children to regain their youth. I have always dreamt of opening my own bakery to benefit myself, my family, and those around me. With support from the centre, now I can.”

“Syrian women and girls have been facing extraordinarily challenging circumstances as they cope with losing their homes and sustaining their families”, says Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of UN Women. “The economic opportunities and safe spaces we will be creating will be both short-term resources and lifelong skills, supporting them to build sustainable livelihoods, free from violence and poverty. Launching this programme reaffirms the EU’s strong commitment to women’s empowerment and ending violence against women and girls.”

“Almost half of the people affected by the Syria crisis are women, states Michael Kӧhler, Director for Southern Neighbourhood Policy at the European Commission’s DG NEAR. “Women and children often catch the brunt of violent conflict. So far insufficient attention has been paid to their needs, but also to their potential. When we empower women, they will develop sustainable economic and social solutions for themselves and their families. This is why I am particularly pleased that the EU Madad Fund is supporting women and girls.”

Funding from the EU’s Madad Fund will help to scale up significantly UN Women’s targeted interventions in Jordan, Iraq and Turkey, and joins funding from the Government of Japan as an important and timely contribution to address women’s empowerment priorities in the context of the Syrian crisis regional response, and towards the achievement of the globally agreed Sustainable Development Goals.

Yemen December 20, 2017: Today, the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen- represented by the Spokesperson, Col. Turki Al Maliki, along with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Yemen- Ambassador MonahmmedAl Jaber, spoke at a joint press conference in Riyadh to discuss details around a more comprehensive approach to relieve the suffering of the Yemeni people and address the humanitarian situation there with a long-term view. The full humanitarian response plan will be announced soon.  
Humanitarian Plan Overview by the Kingdom’s Ambassador to Yemen, Ambassador Mohammed Al Jaber

- The comprehensive humanitarian efforts aim to remedy the human condition in Yemen, through providing humanitarian aid and commercial shipments of foodstuffs, petroleum products, and other commercial goods delivered to the Yemeni people in all regions of Yemen. It aims at doing so in a way that addresses the needs of Yemen, providing a means for a dignified life for the Yemeni people, at a level much higher than it was at during the year 2017. The goal of the humanitarian operations is not to provide a temporary solution but to address and repair the humanitarian conditions in Yemen in a comprehensive and lasting manner.

- The Coalition today has declared that it will continue to keep Hodeidah Port open for humanitarian and aid provisions, allowing entry for commercial shipments, including petroleum byproducts, foodstuff, and other products, for thirty days, as a measure to support the effort of the UN envoy Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh and his recommendations regarding Hodeidah Port.

- The Coalition will permit the entry of the UN’s four cranes to Hodeidah Port.

- The humanitarian operations include increasing the capacity of the Yemeni ports, using the various land passes from the Kingdom, and using the Port of Jizan, if the need arises, to ensure that humanitarian aid and commercial shipments are delivered to all the regions in Yemen.

- The Coalition will provide safe passage corridors for the humanitarian aid and commercial shipments to reach their destinations in all the regions of Yemen. This step aims to ensure that the humanitarian aid operations are flexible. The goal of delivering comprehensive humanitarian aid and commercial shipments remains, despite the Iranian-backed Houthi militias continued impedance and rejection of all the global efforts and suggestions in this regard.

- We will coordinate with the legitimate government of Yemen, through convening urgently in the coming days with the UN and other humanitarian organizations, to discuss the various details of the humanitarian operations, and the means and mechanisms of implementation, as well as, the role of the UN and humanitarian aid agencies play, to complete the organizational discussion and begin implementation as soon as possible. We will also discuss with the UN the humanitarian contributions needed to ease the suffering of our neighbors in Yemen.

- We continue to work on implementing these steps at a time when our cities and our citizens face a continued assault by ballistic missiles at the hands of the Iranian-backed Houthi militia. In this comprehensive humanitarian operation; we seek to lift the injustice and oppression that these Iranian-supported militias are placing on the people of Yemen. We will not allow the Iranian-backed Houthi militia to continue to dominate and loot the humanitarian aid and commercial shipments and use them in their assault on the people of Yemen

**Operational Statement by the Spokesperson for the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen, Colonel Turki Al Maliki**

The Threat of Ballistic Missiles:

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels pose a direct threat to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The Iranianbacked Houthi militia threaten the Kingdom’s territory both through missile launches and through attempts by militants to penetrate the border on foot in mountainous areas. o He confirmed that the missiles fired at Riyadh were produced in Iran.  
These missiles were not previously present in Yemen. o He confirmed that at least ballistic 83 missiles have been fired into the Kingdom’s territory. o He reiterated that Iranian-supplied missiles are a security threat for the region, as well as, a growing number of countries, such as Lebanon and Europe.  
Humanitarian Aid Access:

- Col. Al Maliki reiterated that goods are continuing to enter Yemen even after the first missile launch into Riyadh:

o AIR ENTRY: Nov 13-Dec 20 -- 340 permits for aid delivery at 5 airports. 196 tons of cargo. o SEA ENTRY: Nov 13-Dec 20 – 259 permits issued, 435,051 tons of food and 296 tons of medical; including fuel supplies.

- He confirmed that the Coalition intends to keep Hodeidah Port open for 30 days as stated today. In addition to the previous aid, commercial food and fuel aid are also permitted to enter.

- As iterated by Ambassador Al Jaber, 4 cranes funded by USAID will be allowed into Hodeidah Port soon.

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that the Iranian-backed Houthi leadership continuously refuse to accept proposals from the UN Special Envoy for inspection protocols or independent administration of the Port of Hodeidah.  

Targeting Procedures and Military Operations:

- Col. Al Maliki also mentioned that Coalition airstrikes are based on intelligence and extensive monitoring and surveillance, to ensure all targets are military installations and to avoid civilian casualties.

- He reiterated that targeting is specific, clear, and legal. o Extensive precautions are taken to avoid civilian areas, especially where women and children are present.

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that some strikes are made at the request of the Yemeni Armed Forces. o Examples of facilities targeted include weapons factories, storage facilities, training camps, air defense assets, and coastal radar threatening Red Sea ships.

- Over 167,000 refugee children benefitted from a conditional cash transfer for education (CCTE) payment for attending school regularly in preceding months – a 22% increase over the September payment.

- Between April-November, UNICEF and NGO partner ASAM distributed almost 41,800 protection vouchers to more than 18,800 vulnerable refugee families in six provinces, benefitting over 57,700 children.

- UNICEF provided support to the Ministry of Health for a third vaccination campaign for refugee and migrant children under five. Over 376,000 children were screened in 20 provinces, 117,000 of whom were found to have missed doses and vaccinated accordingly.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

In November, the number of registered refugees and asylum seekers in Turkey stood at over 3.7 million. Nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, of which 1.5 million are children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.

Meanwhile, over 3,200 refugees and migrants successfully journeyed by sea from Turkey to Greece in November, a 22% decrease compared to October. An estimated 35% of those who crossed are believed to be children.2 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, an additional 2,052 people were rescued or apprehended, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece.  

Under the framework of the EU-Turkey Statement, seven rounds of returns took place for 75 people (including two accompanied children)3 , bringing the total number of re-admissions to 1,469 since the Statement came into effect in March 2016.

This is particularly apparent at the moment in Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, where the population suffer from lack of food and urgent medical care.

The increased presence afforded by the opening of the humanitarian office makes it possible for Switzerland, under the leadership of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, to monitor more closely the dialogue to secure humanitarian access to the affected population, to intensify efforts to improve relief services and to better monitor projects on the ground. The humanitarian office will also increase support to local humanitarian organisations in addition to that provided to international agencies.

One of the world's worst humanitarian crises, the conflict in Syria is now in its seventh year. About 18 million people, including 13 million inside Syria, depend on humanitarian aid. Since the crisis began in 2011, Switzerland has provided over CHF 315 million to support people affected by the crisis. About half of this funding is used to help those in need in Syria itself. This is currently Switzerland's biggest humanitarian operation.  

Since the Swiss embassy closed along with the SDC's cooperation office in spring 2012, Switzerland has mainly carried out its humanitarian efforts through its representations in neighbouring countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey). In the context of this regional crisis, these representations will continue to play a central role in humanitarian efforts.

Switzerland provides humanitarian relief in response to the specific needs of the people affected. It works in accordance with the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. Humanitarian aid is provided throughout Syria to people affected by the conflict, whatever their ethnic, religious or political affiliations.

In order to meet the considerable needs of those affected, Switzerland supports tried and tested partner organisations such as the ICRC, UN agencies and international and local partners in Syria and in the region, to enable them to carry out humanitarian projects. Specialists from the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit and the Swiss Expert Pool for Civilian Peacebuilding have also been working for partner organisations in Syria and in the region for a number of years.

Switzerland's commitment in Syria is based on three pillars: in addition to providing humanitarian relief to support those in need in Syria and neighbouring countries, Switzerland is also working for a political solution to the conflict. It is also working to promote and ensure compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights, and to combat impunity.

“Supported by UNHCR, we are providing concrete aid for the victims of the Syria conflict and are sending an important signal that Austria will continue its tradition as a dedicated humanitarian aid donor”, said Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl in a statement on the decision of the first Council of Ministers session of the new Federal Government to mobilise a further 150,000 euros of aid from the Foreign Disaster Fund for Syrian refugees.

“These funds enable us to provide support to approximately 4,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan. It is of great personal importance that we use these funds to support, in particular, women who have been victims of sexual or gender-specific violence, as well as children who are either unaccompanied or have been separated from their families”, said Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl. Activities specifically designed to benefit women include psychological help and legal advice for women who are survivors of sexual or gender-specific violence, as well as measures for the prevention of such violence. Financial aid for medical treatment is also provided. The funds will be issued to UNCHR via the Austrian Development Agency.

The armed conflict in Syria has given rise to one of the most serious humanitarian catastrophes of recent decades. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), more than 13.1 million Syrians are reliant on humanitarian aid. Close to five million have sought refuge abroad, most of them in neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. The number of internally displaced persons has risen by just under a million in the last seven months alone.",4589,"Contributions"

Even though the situation is normalising throughout the country, Dominica remains seriously impacted. Over 80 percent of houses still have inadequate roofing, many children have not yet returned to school, 90 per cent of the population still does not have electricity, and a sizeable portion of the population is highly vulnerable due to the loss of their main source of livelihoods.  

Humanitarian actors are transitioning from relief to recovery-oriented activities and coordination mechanisms are reflecting this shift.

- 97,000 people return to Marawi following the end of conflict; heavilydamaged areas remain off-limits 

- IDPs and returnees lack access to adequate services, livelihoods 

- USAID/OFDA provides support to vulnerable populations in Marawi and surrounding areas

**KEY DEVELOPMENTS**

- On October 23, the Government of the Philippines (GPH) announced the end of the five-month offensive against Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-affiliated armed groups in Marawi, the capital city of Lanao del Sur Province in the Philippines’ Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The GPH and relief actors are responding to continued humanitarian needs among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees. As of December 3, the GPH had registered nearly 354,000 IDPs.

- Of the 354,000 registered IDPs, approximately 97,000 had returned to Marawi as of December 10, according to the GPH Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). However, the GPH continues to restrict returns to the most-affected barangays—the smallest administrative divisions in the Philippines—due to widespread damage and destruction of homes and ongoing protection risks.

- Lack of basic services and livelihood opportunities in Marawi continue to hinder IDP returns. In addition, relief actors report that displaced populations residing in informal sites and host communities lack sufficient access to basic services.

- In FY 2017, USAID/OFDA provided $3 million to address the multi-sector needs of vulnerable populations in Marawi and neighboring areas, including through the provision of protection, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance.",4589,"Contributions"
2385919,"Mexico Earthquakes Humanitarian Situation Report - Three Month Review, 19 December 2017 **I.THREE MONTHS IN REVIEW WHAT HAS HAPPENED?**

* On 7 and 19 September, 2017 Mexico was struck by two earthquakes of 8.2 and 7.1 magnitude on the Richter scale, respectively. The main affected states were Oaxaca, Chiapas, Mexico City, Puebla and Morelos. An estimated 7 million children live in these 5 states.

* Three months after the earthquakes, most children living in the most affected municipalities in the five states have gradually returned to school and to their normal lives.

* UNICEF's response plan during these three months focused on: 1)protecting children from violence, exploitation and abuse in shelters and public spaces of temporary refuge, as well as providing safe spaces and psychosocial support; 2) promoting educational continuity for children by advocating and supporting an early return to school and prevention of school drop-out; and 3) ensuring access to adequate hand-washing and sanitation facilities, as well as hygiene supplies.

* UNICEF established alliances with key partners from government, civil society and the private sector to establish 34 child friendly spaces, benefiting 3,126 children; train 353 teachers, who in turn will further train 5,296 teaching staff and 171 child-friendly space facilitators with tools and strategies for psychosocial support; establish 100 temporary learning spaces with water and sanitation facilities for severely damaged schools; distribute 410 schools-in-a-box benefiting 16,400 students; and distribute 20 early childhood development (ECD) kits, benefiting at least 800 children under 5 years of age.

* To date, the total value of funds raised by UNICEF amount to US$ 5,194,331.04, which surpassed the total initial ask of US$ 4.6 million.

* These actions were implemented initially in 24 priority municipalities, identified after five rapid assessment missions of UNICEF staff to the affected areas in the first 24-72 hours following the earthquakes. An additional 10 municipalities were included in the plan, where UNICEF staff identified urgent needs of children and women in the said areas, after subsequent missions.

* Three months later, UNICEF has developed an Early Recovery Plan to be implemented between January and June 2018.",4589,"Contributions"
2385889,"UNFPA Response in Yemen: Monthly Situation Report #11 - November 2017 **HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MONTH**

On 6 November, ‘temporary’ closure of all of Yemen’s airports, seaports and land crossings took effect, disrupting the delivery of humanitarian assistance to 27 million people. UNFPA and all humanitarian actors called for the borders to be re-opened and flights to be resumed, stressing that continued closure will sharply aggravate humanitarian crisis in Yemen and bring millions of people in Yemen closer to starvation and death. Of particular concern was on the lives of 52,800 pregnant women who risk complications with immediate danger to their lives if they do not get urgent life-saving maternal care and medicines.

While some sea and airports were opened following two weeks of complete closure, the humanitarian crisis has continued to aggravate posing a critical threat to the lives of millions already struggling to survive. Due to limited funding, humanitarian agencies are only able to target one third of the population (7 million), while some two thirds of the population rely on commercially imported supplies, making the continued availability of commodities in the markets essential in preventing an unprecedented famine in Yemen.

UNFPA's response in Yemen has so far reached over 2 million people with reproductive health and gender-based violence services and information.

Support in November included treatment of 46 fistula cases in Sana'a and Aden.'Mama kits' containing items for the hygiene and protection of mother's and their newborns were provided to maternity units across 8 governorates. In addition, 118 unemployed midwives are being assisted to operated private home-based clinics, providing critical life-saving maternal health services to pregnant women and women of childbearing age.

The new Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Adolescent Health Strategy for Yemen 2017-2021 was launched and endorsed in November.

2385799,"Evaluation of the European Commission's interventions in the Humanitarian Health sector, 2014-2016 **Executive summary** 

This evaluation provides an independent assessment of the European Commission's Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations’ (DG ECHO’s) interventions in the humanitarian health sector during the period 2014 to 2016. The evaluation, launched by DG ECHO in November 2016, was carried out by ICF Consulting Services Ltd, with specialist inputs from humanitarian aid and health experts. 

The purpose of the evaluation was to analyse DG ECHO’s portfolio of health interventions between 2014-2016, reporting findings against seven core evaluation criteria specified in the Terms of Reference (relevance, coherence, connectedness, effectiveness, efficiency, EU Added Value and sustainability), in order to provide conclusions and recommendations to inform DG ECHO’s future interventions in this area and feed into the comprehensive Humanitarian Aid evaluation currently being undertaken. 

**Evaluation data sources and methods** 

Findings presented in this report are based on analysis and triangulation of the following data sources: 

 HOPE database records for all 553 DG ECHO-funded humanitarian health actions in Third Countries, reported between 2014-2016; 

 Project reports and FicheOps from a sample of 100 projects; 

 A sample of 52 Humanitarian Implementation Plans (HIPs); 

 Background literature from 55 references; 

 44 semi-structured stakeholder interviews with DG ECHO officers and partners, international donors and development actors; 

 An online survey gathering feedback from 32 DG ECHO partners (106 respondents); 

 Three field visits (exploring the External Assigned Revenues – ExAR – programme in Ivory Coast, DG ECHO’s health interventions in Jordan in response to the Syrian conflict; and DG ECHO’s humanitarian health response in South Sudan); and 

 A research-based case study on the global humanitarian response to the earthquake in Nepal in 2015.

**Validity of evaluation results**

As with any evaluation, limited data and data inconsistencies in some cases, along with the vested interests of different stakeholder groups may affect the quality and strength of findings.

It was not feasible to conduct a review of the full portfolio of health-focused actions, due to budget constraints, and given the high number of funded projects identified. A purposeful sample of 100 was therefore selected to capture the diversity of healthfocused actions funded by DG ECHO and the diversity of contexts in which the intervention took place.

The HOPE Database was the principle source for extracting health-funded actions. A number of inaccuracies related to defining health sub-categories of actions were found when further analysing the data. Findings within this evaluation report reflect the data extracted from the database, however caution was applied when providing views on the amount of funding provided by DG ECHO to each of the pre-defined subcategories, due to this inaccuracy. 

For practical reasons such as time and budget available for the evaluation, as well as security concerns, it was not possible to randomly select sites for fieldwork. The approach to selection of sites for fieldwork was therefore both purposeful and convenient, involving DG ECHO regional health experts and Headquarters (HQ).  
As far as possible, methodological limitations were overcome by using complementary research methods to enhance the reliability and validity of the data collected, and to provide the basis for cross-verification and triangulation of the evaluation results.  
Caution was exercised when interpreting data and reporting findings, and interests of different stakeholder groups were taken into account to address potential bias and to ensure objectivity. Input, review and validation with external thematic experts contributed to substantiate the validity of the evaluation results. However, in some cases it was not possible to make conclusive findings on the basis of existing evidence: where this was the case, it has been clearly highlighted in the report.

**Main findings**

This section provides summary findings from the descriptive analysis of actions, followed by in-depth analysis by evaluation theme. The final component of this section provides a summary of the main findings observed during the field visit to the ExAR Programme in Cote d’Ivoire.

**Overview of DG ECHO’s response in 2014-2016**

Between 2014 and 2016, DG ECHO funded 553 humanitarian health sector actions in third countries (equivalent to € 616.9 million of funding).

Most funded actions were multi-sectoral – although they had a health focus or health component – combining health activities with nutrition, food security and livelihoods and/or Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) activities. Breaking down health activities into health sub-sectors, the most common health sub-sectors covered by projects were primary health (67% of projects) followed by medical supplies (51%), reproductive health (48%), community outreach (47%), and, prevention and response to outbreaks/epidemics (42.5%). Just over a quarter of projects (27%) included Mental and Psycho-Social support.

Looking at funding breakdowns for country, partner and target group, South Sudan received the largest amount of humanitarian health funding over this period (€ 73 million or 11.4% of the total budget) while globally, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement was the partner organisation receiving the largest amount of funding (€ 121 million, 18.9%). In relation to target groups for funding, the majority of funding (73%) was provided to support IDPs and refugees. Natural disaster-affected populations received the smallest amount of funding. Nearly three quarters (72%) of DG ECHO funding was provided to projects that incorporated preparedness and response activities to epidemics (equivalent to 42.5% of projects).

**Relevance**

DG ECHO’s humanitarian health actions have been relevant to a moderate extent, however better needs assessments would improve relevance of funded actions.  
DG ECHO’s field network of Regional Health Experts (RHEs) were key in providing primary, up-to-date data, and, context-specific information to inform DG ECHO’s response strategies in the health sector. RHEs also engaged with DG ECHO implementing partners at design stage, by, for example, informing partners of thematic priorities and defining crisis-specific strategies. Evidence shows, however, that RHEs were not systematically consulted at the stage of the development of the HIPs or by DG ECHO TAs and partners on projects delivering health activities.",4589,"Contributions"
2385744,"EU funding for disaster preparedness in the Caribbean In the aftermath of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which wreaked havoc across the Caribbean in September 2017, the European Commission has mobilised an additional €3.3 million to support preparedness initiatives that will help countries in the region to avert future crises.

""*It was just a few months ago when the Caribbean islands had to endure the devastating effects of catastrophic hurricanes. These disasters highlighted the vulnerability of these countries to natural hazards, which are only getting worse and more frequent as a consequence of climate change. The EU is committed to invest in emergency preparedness and response to minimise the impact of future disasters*,"" said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides.

The Caribbean region is surrounded by several tectonic plates meaning that it is particularly vulnerable to severe, recurring natural hazards. The new funding will support preparedness initiatives in the region and will be used to enhance local water and sanitation response capacities in Haiti to help local teams provide immediate, high-quality response in emergencies, including in case of epidemics.

The €3.3 million comes on top of the €61 million for disaster preparedness the EU has allocated to the Caribbean since 1994.

**Background**
   
The EU quickly intervened after hurricanes Irma and Maria (both category 5, maximum strength hurricanes) devastated Dominica, Cuba, Antigua and Barbuda, and severely affected Turks & Caicos, St Kitts & Nevis, Sint Maarten and Saint Martin, the British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

Under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, EU Member States provided logistical support for humanitarian relief, civil protection expertise and in-kind assistance to affected Caribbean countries and territories. Additionally, the European Commission allocated €2.9 million in humanitarian relief to provide temporary shelters, safe drinking water, food assistance and health and sanitation services to the most affected islands.

These events took place after an extreme drought, a consequence of the El Niño weather phenomenon, which has affected over 6 million people in Caribbean countries since 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, Commission-funded response interventions worth €14 million in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba helped to mitigate the impact of the drought on people’s livelihoods, food security, and health.",4589,"Contributions"

The National Staff Association of the UN Mission in South Sudan has mobilized a variety of items to support vulnerable children at the Juba Orphanage Home and Al-Shabbah Children’s Hospital in the capital, Juba.

Items delivered to the two institutions included rice, maize flour, beans, cooking oil and non-food items such as tables, chairs and blankets.

“We are trying to protect and save the lives of these children with the assistance we have given to them in order to create an environment conducive for learning and a healthy mindset,” said Bennett Kenyi, the President of the NSA. “We are donating these items to give them the courage necessary in order to grow up as responsible citizens in the future.”

Mr Kenyi said that the Association mobilized the little resources they had to support the vulnerable children, who will grow up to be the leaders of South Sudan.

Jubek State Minister of Gender, Child and Social Welfare, Rose Lisok Paulino, said that she was moved by the spirit of volunteerism shown by UNMISS national staff. She said that such acts of kindness give hope to the children that they have not been forgotten.

Ms Rose said that war, which has never been part of South Sudanese culture, was to blame for the ongoing suffering in the young nation. 

The State Minister appealed to the United Nations mission to help bring lasting peace to South Sudan so that the nation can live in peace and harmony.

“No mother wants to see her children go hungry, grow up without education, and live in an insecure environment. A mother needs the best for her kids and the best for her family,” she said.

The Director of Juba Orphanage Home, Angelo Kenyi Samuel said that they have been struggling to mobilize financial support for the running of the orphanage which currently houses 55 children.

The Jubek State Secretariat also received some office chairs and tables.

As part of the UK’s continuing commitment to a lasting peace in Colombia, Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister for the Americas Sir Alan Duncan has announced an increase in financial support for Colombia’s Peace Agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

Over £7m of additional funding from the Government’s Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) will support the peace agreement at a critical stage. This includes a new £5m contribution to the UN’s Trust Fund, which will help reintegrate former combatants and support recovery in post conflict areas.

Sir Alan Duncan, Minister for Europe and the Americas, said:

I am delighted to announce that the UK is increasing support to Colombia’s Peace Process with over £7m of additional funding, bringing our total support in 2017/18 to almost £12m.

There has been significant progress since the signing of the peace agreement in November 2016. The FARC have laid down their arms and become a political party. But there is more work ahead. The implementation of the peace agreement is now entering a critical and complex stage, which is why we are increasing our support.

The new funding has enabled the UK to contribute an extra £5m to the UN Trust Fund, which will support projects that help stabilisation in post-conflict areas, and the reintegration of former combatants back into normal life.

The funding will also provide additional support to the Organisation of American States Peace Monitoring Mission in Colombia, and to the work of the UN Office for Human Rights.

2385344,"European Union increases support for the anti-personnel mine ban convention  calls on those using landmines to cease their use Vienna, Brussels, Geneva – The European Union (EU) has announced additional support to help countries implement their obligations under the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention which bans the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of these weapons. 

The EU reaffirmed its strong support for the Convention during the Sixteenth Meeting of the States Parties of the Convention taking place in Vienna. Over 400 representatives of government, international and non-governmental organisations are meeting at UN Vienna to address the implementation of the landmark disarmament and humanitarian treaty signed this December 20 years ago. 

“The EU condemns the use of anti-personnel mines by any actor, whether States or non-state actors. We also appeal to all States not party to the Convention and non-state actors to stop manufacturing, trading and using these weapons,” said Jacek Bylica, the EU’s Special Envoy for Disarmament and Non-proliferation during the meeting. “Particularly worrying is the use of improvised anti-personnel mines in the context of urban warfare, specifically aimed at terrorising civilians and hindering the return of internally displaced persons and refugees. This is a key driver in forcing people to leave their homes and a major factor behind the current refugee crisis,” added Jacek Bylica. 

“The use of improvised anti-personnel mines has created new large-scale contamination in Iraq, a State Party to the Convention, and Libya and Syria, which have not yet joined. The use of these improvised mines has resulted in a reversal of the downward trend in the number of global mine casualties for the second year in a row since the entry into force of the Convention. The new threats must be addressed with determination, without distracting attention from the vast areas across the world that remain inaccessible due to legacy mine contamination,” said the EU Envoy, meaning countries like Angola, Cambodia and Zimbabwe which are still suffering the effects of landmines planted decades ago. 

“Their impact continues to disproportionately affect rural communities, usually some of the poorest, as well as minorities and marginalised groups. They should not be forgotten. In light of these developments, it is necessary to reaffirm our commitment with regard to international cooperation and assistance, as the obligation to rid the world of anti-personnel mines is a collective effort by all States Parties.” 

**European Union financial assistance to mine action**

The EU and its Member States are one of the world’s largest donors for humanitarian mine action. EU assistance includes mine clearance, risk education, victim assistance, stockpile destruction, and benefits nearly all heavily affected countries, including Chad, Colombia, Croatia, Iraq, Lao PDR, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, Syria and Ukraine. 

In the 2012-2016 period the EU through its institutions and Member States, committed over €600 million to address the threat of mines and explosive remnants of war in conflict-affected countries. 

Some States Parties to the Convention however, need additional capacity-building support to identify and overcome remaining challenges if they are to fulfil their ambition of a mine-free world by 2025. 

The European Union through a Council Decision will allocate an additional €2.3 million to promote the universal adherence to the treaty including through the Convention’s Special Envoys Prince Mired of Jordan and Princess Astrid of Belgium. Other projects under the Council Decision will help States Parties to implement their mine clearance, stockpile destruction and victim assistance commitments under the 2014 Maputo Action Plan of the Convention. 

“The Decision will facilitate national stakeholder meetings in mine-affected countries with relevant authorities, international and non-governmental organisations, donors and mine-affected communities. In the spirit of partnership embedded in the Convention, the implementation of this Decision will include the participation of the 1997 Nobel Peace Co-Laureate the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other relevant UN and international organisations,” said Jacek Bylica. 

**The Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention**

The Convention was adopted in Oslo and signed in Ottawa in December 1997. To date, there are 163 States Parties – just last week, heavily mine-affected Sri Lanka joined the treaty. Together, the Parties have destroyed over 51 million landmines, and liberated millions of hectares of once contaminated land. To date, 30 States have declared being mine free, while 31 continue to implement their mine clearance obligation. 29 States Parties have declared responsibility for a large number – hundreds or thousands – of landmine survivors, including some of the poorest in the world and face significant challenges in fulfilling their responsibilities.",4589,"Contributions"

**Khartoum, 20 December 2017**. A new £31.5 million multi-year contribution from the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) is helping the humanitarian community in Sudan provide life-saving support to millions in need of assistance.

Through the flexible Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF), a multi-donor pool fund managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the United Kingdom funding supports Sudan’s most critically vulnerable populations in times of need and plays a vital emergency response role in close coordination with the Government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission.

“There are significant shortfalls in the funding required to address the humanitarian needs in Sudan, which makes responding to new emergencies difficult and puts lives at risk. This additional contribution by the United Kingdom will enable humanitarian agencies to continue to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance by meeting the needs of the most vulnerable people, and helps the International Community to play its role in supporting the Government to respond,” said Dr. Christopher Pycroft, the Head of DFID in Sudan.

DFID has been steadfast in its backing to the SHF since its inception, and its latest contribution comes at a critical time. As a strategic fund, the SHF constitutes 8 per cent of the funding available to humanitarian partners in Sudan, and plays a vital role in providing an effective, coordinated, prioritised and principled humanitarian response.

The United Kingdom will provide an additional £11.5 million for 2017, which is their second contribution to the SHF this year. Multi-year funding provides a measure of flexibility in countries where humanitarian scenarios may change year-on-year, allowing donors to engage in programmes that may cause longer term impact and reduce aid dependency. 

The donation from the United Kingdom boosts Sudan’s $804 million Humanitarian Response Plan 2017 (HRP 2017), currently closing the year with a 55% funding shortfall. “We are extremely grateful for the support from the United Kingdom. In light of the significant funding gaps this year, this second allocation is a testament to its commitment to the people of Sudan and the humanitarian community,” said Mr. Selva Ramachandran,  
Humanitarian Coordinator, a.i. for Sudan.

“The German Government greatly appreciates its strong and effective partnership with WFP in Iraq,” said Dr. Cyrill Nunn, Germany’s Ambassador to Iraq. “WFP plays a critical role in providing life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people in this country. With this additional contribution to WFP’s Emergency Operation, we reconfirm our commitment to those who are in desperate situations - they will not be forgotten.” 

This contribution will allow WFP to increase the scale and reach of cash-based transfers through WFP’s food assistance management system, known as SCOPE. This allows vulnerable Iraqis to buy nutritious foods of their choice from local shops. Every month, families are notified by text message that their electronic credit allocation of around €15 euros (US$17) per family member has been reloaded. Using a WFP SCOPE card, they can withdraw cash from a local money transfer agency or pay for food in designated stores. 

“We’re grateful to the German Government for its contribution to assist Iraqis still affected by conflict,” said Sally Haydock, WFP Representative and Country Director in Iraq. “By giving cash assistance to families, we are giving them a broader choice in what they buy while helping strengthen the local food market.” 

Since 2014, Germany has contributed €104 million (US$122 million) to WFP’s operations in Iraq. These funds have enabled WFP to provide nutritious food to the most vulnerable Iraqis and Syrian refugees every month.",4589,"Contributions"
2384969,"Somalia: Humanitarian Dashboard - November 2017 (issued on 20 December 2017) **SITUATION OVERVIEW**

The unprecedented drought and conflict have resulted in severe and growing humanitarian needs, according to the Humanitarian Needs Overview released on 29 November. Over 6.2 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, half of these require urgent life-saving assistance. This includes 866,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as of November 2017, reflecting a sharp spike in the number of most vulnerable people, up from 83,000 people in Emergency in January 2017. More than one-third of those in need are internally displaced persons (IDPs).  
Humanitarians continue to reach over three million people per month with life-saving assistance and livelihood support. However, with humanitarian needs growing, famine prevention efforts need to be sustained into 2018, alongside scaling up of livelihoods support to prevent populations at risk from sliding deeper into food insecurity. Early funding next year, to support the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, will be critical to enable humanitarian partners to sustain the current life-saving efforts.",4589,"Contributions"
2384789,"Horn of Africa: Humanitarian Impacts of Drought – Issue 12 (8 December 2017) **DISPLACEMENT**

Drought continues to cause displacement of populations and livestock, along with other protection concerns. In Somalia, drought-related internal displacement increased to 874,000 in November, up from 837,000 in September. Overall, more than 1.1 million people have been displaced as a result of drought, floods, conflict and insecurity in 2017, nearly two-thirds of these are under age 18. A spike in conflict driven displacements in multiple regions was observed during November. Approximately 6,000 IDP returns were recorded in November. In Kenya, lack of pasture, crop failure and loss of livestock have caused pastoral populations to migrate long distances, while families have adopted negative coping mechanisms — including increased child labour and early marriage — in response to the impacts of the drought. Sexual and domestic violence are reported to have increased during the drought, with women walking long distances to collect water or firewood at heightened risk of sexual violence. 

**MALNUTRITION**

Across the Horn of Africa, nearly 5.2 million children and women are estimated to be acutely malnourished. In Ethiopia, 3.6 million children and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) are projected to be acutely malnourished in 2017. From January to September 2017, 255,623 children were treated for severe acute malnutrition (SAM), while 843,837 children under age 5 and 820,712 pregnant and lactating women (1,664,549 total) were treated for moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). In Somalia,

1.2 million children and PLW are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition from September 2017 to September 2018 and malnutrition rates have reached emergency levels in some locations, especially among internally displaced people. In Kenya, 370,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition in the drought-affected Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) areas. On 3 November, a nurses’ strike ended after nearly five months of service delivery interruption. The strike significantly affected nutrition outreach activities, with up to 40 to 50 per cent of planned outreaches not completed in West Pokot, Baringo, Garissa and Isiolo counties. As a result, there was a drop in admissions to acute malnutrition treatment programs across affected counties.

**FOOD SECURITY** 

More than 15.2 million people are severely food insecure in the Horn of Africa, with the number in Somalia reaching nearly double the 5-year average. In Ethiopia, 8.5 million people are food insecure. A Government-led multi-agency needs assessment is ongoing from 18 November to 13 December to assess the performance of the kiremt (summer) rains in the highlands of northern, central, western and south-eastern Ethiopia and the short seasonal deyr/hagaya (autumn) rains in the lowland areas of south and south-eastern Ethiopia. Chronic shortages of water and fodder have already been observed in most parts of the current drought-belt. In Somalia, more than 3.3 million people are severely food insecure, including 2.4 million people who are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 866,000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Well below-average agricultural production has been reported and pastoralists have suffered significant livestock losses. The deyr rainy season (October to December) started late and is generally performing below average, marking a fourth failed rainy season. Rainfall in December is not expected to significantly improve crop prospects and the risk of famine (IPC Phase 5) remains. In Kenya, drought conditions have persisted in Garissa, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kilifi, Marsabit, Narok and Samburu counties and 3.4 million people are estimated to be facing severe food insecurity (IPC 3 or above) in December. 

**DISEASE OUTBREAKS**

Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) and cholera cases have decreased in Ethiopia and Somalia, while new counties have been affected in Kenya. In Ethiopia, since January 2017, 48,592 AWD cases were reported across the country, the vast majority from Somali region. The measles outbreak in Ethiopia is also ongoing, with 3,490 cases reported as at 3 November. Affected regions are: Oromia (46 per cent of reported cases); Amhara (21 per cent); Addis Ababa (16 per cent); and Somali (20 per cent).  
In Somalia, AWD/cholera cases are decreasing. Since the start of the year, some 78,426 cases (567 in October), including 1,159 deaths (CFR 1.48 per cent), were reported, with no deaths reported in October and November. Children under age 5 constitute more than 58 per cent of the reported cases. The number of measles cases has also declined in recent months but remains at epidemic levels. More than 20,000 cases were recorded between January and 19 November 2017. This is four times higher than in 2015 and 2016 respectively. A nationwide measles vaccination campaign is being planned, targeting 4.2 million children. In Kenya, the cholera outbreak is active in seven counties (Nairobi, Garissa, Mombasa, Turkana, Wajir, Embu and Kirinyaga), with 3,967 cases, including 76 deaths (CFR 1.9 per cent), reported from 1 January to 29 November.",4589,"Contributions"

and to build resilience.**

The UK Aid and Irish Aid are providing £6.8m (circa $9m or 6.6bn MWK) that will ensure the World Food Programme and a Save the Children-led NGO consortium can provide cash transfers to meet the food needs of over 500,000 vulnerable Malawians. The Vice President, together with UN and NGO implementing partners, will launch this support in Nsanje today, Wednesday 20th December.

This new package of development assistance from the UK and Ireland will help hundreds of 
thousands of the poorest people with cash transfers to buy food and other essentials during the difficult pre-harvest lean season, and is in support of the Government of Malawi’s forthcoming National Resilience Strategy.

In line with Government data and plans, DFID and Irish Aid are targeting the most vulnerable 
districts: Nsanje, Balaka, Chikwawa and Mwanza (the worst affected four Districts) plus Machinga, Blantyre, Mulanje, Phalombe and Neno. This leaves a number of other districts seeking support from others.

Jen Marshall, Head of the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) in Malawi said: “This year is a better year for food availability in Malawi, providing the chance for Government and Development Partners to do things differently.

“This cash-only safety net programme provides cost efficient, flexible, immediate assistance. But now is the time to plan how Malawi’s long term social protection programmes can better respond to high levels of vulnerability. And importantly, these cash transfers are being provided alongside a further scale up of UK Aid funded resilience-building interventions that aim to reduce communities’ and the country’s dependence on short-term responses.

“We all agree that Malawi urgently needs to break the cycle of annual emergency response and find long term solutions, including expanded long term safety nets, more resilient livelihoods, and more predictable markets for maize and other crops.”",4589,"Contributions"
2384684,"FAO and WFP step up efforts to alleviate hunger in Greater Kasai **Belgian funding channelled through the UN bodies will benefit tens of thousands at risk in the Democratic Republic of Congo**

KINSHASA – Against a backdrop of intense human suffering, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) are joining forces to mitigate some of the effects of conflict in Greater Kasai. The two United Nations agencies will be using US$10 million in Belgian government funding to improve access to food for more than 100,000 people. Some 18,000 households – whether displaced, returnee or host families – stand to benefit.

""Thanks to this significant contribution, we are able to ramp up our efforts and work closely together to prevent people, including young children, from dying of hunger and malnutrition,"" said FAO Representative ad interim Alexis Bonte.

“These interventions will not only protect vulnerable people, but help revive agricultural production and boost social cohesion in communities affected by the crisis,"" added Claude Jibidar, WFP’s Country Representative in DRC.

Under the project, WFP will distribute fortified maize meal, legumes, fortified vegetable oil and iodized salt – as well as cash. Children aged 6 to 59 months, and pregnant and breastfeeding women, will be treated for three months with special nutritious supplements. For its part, FAO will supply vegetable-growing kits – hoe, rake, spade, watering can, and vegetable and fruit seeds – that will allow each family to eat for two months and sell what they don’t eat.

There will be training in raising guinea pigs as a source of protein; and in processing and marketing bamboo to use as firewood, kitchen utensils, baskets, canoes, fishing equipment and fences. Vegetable gardens near health centres and women's associations will meanwhile provide malnourished children, and pregnant and nursing women, with micronutrients such as iron and zinc.  

The joint initiative will be rolled out in partnership with the DRC Ministry of Agriculture and local NGOs. But welcome as it is, it cannot meet anything like the full extent of humanitarian needs.

The conflict in Kasai, formerly a maize-producing region, has forced a million people out of their homes and off their land. Some 3.2 million are now severely hungry. Child malnutrition is widespread. 

The tragedy experienced by the Congolese people demands greater solidarity. FAO and WFP are advocating for significantly expanded funding to address harrowing levels of need.

Above all, the two agencies are calling for a lasting peace that allows everyone to grow their own food, rebuild their livelihoods and secure a more prosperous future.

WFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide by distributing food assistance in emergencies and working with communities to improve their nutritional status and build resilience. Each year, WFP provides assistance to some 80 million people in nearly 80 countries.

FAO's mandate is to improve nutrition levels, agricultural productivity, the quality of life of rural people and to help eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.

2384144,"New assistance package for Lebanon: EU strongly committed to supporting the country's development and stability Brussels, 19 December 2017

The EU-funded projects will support the people of Lebanon in key sectors such as democratic participation, sanitation and local developments.

The European Commission adopted a new €44 million assistance package that will contribute to the promotion of stability and economic and social development in Lebanon. The projects will support the country's electoral reform process, will aim at enhancing the waste management sector and will foster socio-economic development along the Litani River Basin.

Ahead of visiting Lebanon, High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini said: ""During my visit to Lebanon today, I will confirm the European Union full support to stability, security, and unity of the country. Lebanon can count on EU commitment from the humanitarian aid to development cooperation, but also on economic and security levels. We will also continue to accompany Lebanon in its solidarity towards Syrian people fleeing the crisis.  The next Brussels II Conference on supporting the future of Syria and the region will be the opportunity to channel more support from the international community for Lebanon"".

Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations Johannes Hahn said: ""We will support the electoral reform and democratic participation, promote integrated waste management, and help improving socio-economic conditions for the Lebanese people. The new EU projects come in addition to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the Syrian conflict to the Lebanese society and economy, for which the EU has provided €1 billion to Syrian refugees and host communities in Lebanon"".

The package consists of three programmes:

•  The programme ""Support to Electoral Reform and Democratic Participation in Lebanon"" aims at developing the capacity of national entities to conduct credible, periodical, transparent and inclusive elections in the country. It will strengthen public confidence in the electoral process, thereby contributing to Lebanon's democratic consolidation.

•  ""Towards a Decentralised Waste Management Integrated Response"" programme is designed to enhance the capacity of the Governorates of Beirut and Mount Lebanon to process waste management. It will also contribute to the establishment of better and environmentally-friendly waste governance in general.

• The ""Local Development Programme along the Litani River Basin"" component is focused on promoting stability in the country through the improvement of socio-economic conditions and the resilience of the populations living along the Litani River. It will strengthen the institutional capacities of local governments and promote public and private partnerships generating employment opportunities and improving delivery of basic needs.

This package comes in addition to the support provided by the European Commission to Lebanon since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, which amounts to more than €1.2 billion, including almost €1 billion in assistance to Lebanese hosting communities and refugees.

**Background**

The European Union and Lebanon adopted a Partnership Priority and a Compact in December 2016 to improve the living conditions of both refugees temporarily staying in Lebanon and of vulnerable host communities. The Partnership aims at improving the socio-economic prospects, security, stability and resilience of the whole Lebanon. In turn Lebanon commits to ease the temporary stay of Syrian refugees, in particular regarding their residency status.

The EU and Lebanon established a Single Support Framework (SSF) for 2017-2020 that frames the EU's financial cooperation around three broad intervention areas: (1) growth and job creation, (2) local governance and socio-economic development and (3) Rule of Law and enhancing security. This SSF is also instrumental in honouring the pledge the EU made towards Lebanon on the occasion of the conference the EU hosted in Brussels, in April 2017, to ensure continuous engagement of the international community in supporting the future of Syria and the region. A second Brussels conference is foreseen in spring 2018.

The package adopted under the Annual Action Programme 2017 follows up on the SSF commitments, by allocating money to concrete programmes that will become operational on the ground in the months and years to come.",4589,"Contributions"
2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4590,"Coordination"

At the beginning of 2017, more than 128 million people needed humanitarian assistance in 33 countries. OCHA appealed for US$22.2 billion – the largest humanitarian appeal ever launched.

The Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), then Stephen O’Brien, warned: “The scale of humanitarian crises today is greater than at any time since the United Nations was founded. Not in living memory have so many people needed our support and solidarity to survive and live in safety and dignity.”

By midyear, this had increased to some 145 million people, which means that as needs rise, so does the amount of money needed to help people. Throughout the year, humanitarian agencies reached tens of millions of people and saved millions of lives.

The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent.

The Protection Cluster held  two operational working group meetings to support and strengthen field-level coordination for the ongoing responses in Eastern Ghouta and Northeast Aleppo. Seven members of the Protection Monitoring Task Force conducted 1059 KI interviews in 119 communities, covering 39 sub-districts, 16 districts, in 7 governorates (Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Damascus, Hama, Homs and Idleb). The Cluster released the first quarterly report of the Protection Monitoring Task Force, which is available here in English and Arabic. The report covers data collected through monthly monitoring from March to June 2017. Data was collected by 12 partners in 1,534 key informant interviews conducted in seven governorates, mostly in northern Syria. The Cluster and Sub-Clusters Technical Review Committees finalized both the second standard Humanitarian Fund allocation, awarding $2M to eight projects. The Cluster reviewed and recommended 12 protection (standalone and integrated) projects for the 2018 HRP, with a budget request of $11.4M.

The GBV Sub-Cluster actively engaged in the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) with the technical review, vetting and final approval of 16 GBV stand-alone projects and 10 integrated projects (GBV-CP or GBV-CP-General Protection). The GBV SC coordination team organized a learning session for GBV SC members (group 2) on GBV supervisory structures. The session was attended by 10 participants (9F, 1M) representing 9 organizations. The new GBV SC IMO hosted by Global Communities started work on Nov 1. On 25th Nov, the 16 Days of Activism against GBV campaign took off with a series of activities in Syria, mainly in WGSS  and in Turkey. The GBV SC engaged in advocacy actions with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), on the importance of a multi-sectoral response to GBV and launching the VOICES from Syria 2018 report. The GBV SC also organized a 4Ws refresher training, attended by 29 people (17M, 12W). Finally the GBV SC organized a 10 days training for Case Managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, GBV SOPs, PSS and Case Management. The first part of this took place from 28th Nov to 2nd Dec and was attended by 17 participants (14F, 3M), representing 14 organizations.

The child protection sub-cluster hosted in Gaziantep the yearly WOS CP meet for partners on 23-24 November. In attendance were 58 participants from 43 organizations. Participants had the opportunity to reflect on the 2017 HRP implementation as well as agree on the strategy for 2018. The need to improve inter-hub engagement on issues such as family tracing, was also highlighted. Field test of the Situation Monitoring tool was conducted and data collected and analyzed. 89 KII were conducted in Rural Damascus, Idleb and Aleppo. This was done to test the tool, the questions and process.

15 Mine Action project were approved to be included in 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) after going through the vetting , strategic and technical review process.  Efforts continue to integrate risk education materials within different sectors distributions.

**Gap**

Limited specialized services or inclusive services for other groups with specific needs, e.g. persons with disabilities or older persons, remains a critical gap for the Cluster.

Limited funding for some partners affecting their capacity to scale up response in a timely manner as required.

There is a high need to increased coverage of areas in need. Many areas and IDPs still have not been reached with risk education.

The 16 Days of Activism will continue until the 10th Dec with activities in Syria, especially in the WGSS and in Turkey. The second part of the 10 days training for GBV case managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, PSS, SOPs and Case Management will be conducted from 4th to 10th Dec. In Dec a CMR specialist from Amman will visit Gaziantep and will meet and train GBV and Health actors. 2 CMR trainings are also planned inside Syria during December. The GBV SC will engage in the consultation process to support the Global GBV AOR in the development of the 2018-2020 Global Strategy.

Strong coordination on winter plan and response is required to make sure the most vulnerable people in need, in camps and out of camps settings are reached with appropriate support.  
As per the IOM-led DTM report, 3.2 million IDPs and 2.6 million Returnees have been identified across the country, from January 2014 to 31 st October 2017. 

▪ The number of IDPs has increased in Camps (from 18% of 3.0 million beginning of Jan.’17 to 24% of 3.2 million end of Oct.’17); 

▪ 49% of the 3.2 million IDPs are currently in private settings (in rentals and in host families) while 12% remain in critical shelter arrangements (unfinished/abandoned building; school/religious buildings and informal settlements) and 15% in other unspecified shelter types. 

▪ The number of returnees has increased (from 1.4 million beginning of Jan.’17 to 2.6 million end of Oct.’17); 

▪ 95% of the returnees are in their habitual residence while 5% remains in critical shelter arrangement and in private settings. 

However MCNA (round-4&5) conducted in April and August revealed that 24% of the returnees remain in very crucial Shelter/NFI need.

**CURRENT CLUSTER INTERVENTIONS (1st Jan. – 31st Oct. 2017)**

▪ Out of the overall target of 2.3 million, 1,700,568 people have been assisted with non-food items kits; 1,120,674 of which have also benefited from shelter interventions. The coverage for non-food items kits stands at 73% of the cluster target; and the coverage for shelter stands at 48% of cluster target. From the total reached beneficiaries, 1,680,378 of vulnerable people were provided with safe and appropriate critical life-saving non-food items, 779,040 of which benefited from appropriate emergency shelter interventions in first line response. In second line response, 332,412 people were assisted with shelter upgrade and basic repair interventions including 20,190 people with critical life-saving non-food items replenishment and 9,222 people were assisted in full cluster response which consist of expand safe, dignified shelter and housing options in accordance with the cluster agreed standards. 

▪ Cluster partners have completed their post distributions monitoring surveys been conducted (by phone or in field visit) in camps and out of camps settings, reaching out 7,341 vulnerable households. 

▪ More than 13 camps across the country benefited from camps maintenance activities such as construction of communal shading, kitchen; rehabilitation of fences, road, drainage and camps electricity network.

This regional appeal will ensure that the response to the food crises in Africa is effectively managed and coordinated beyond the country level, focusing on five key objectives: 

1. Provide strategic oversight, enhanced leadership at the regional level and ensure support to operations.

2. Promote approaches which increase households and community resilience and build sustainable solutions to food insecurity.

3. Facilitate and encourage regional learning and peer-to-peer support.

4. Support the collection, consolidation and effective use of monitoring and data and information.

5. Strengthen and scale up community engagement and accountability approaches and activities.    

This Emergency Appeal has been revised considering the adjusted geographic scope and evolving humanitarian needs in the Africa continent, as well as the human resource requirements of the regional coordination team. A funding gap of CHF 857,045 remains in this revised Emergency Appeal. The strategy has been informed by a continuous analysis of the emergency and operational conditions in the countries with food crises in Africa, and may be further adjusted based on the developments in 2018.

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)). In 2017, these conditions have led several countries to be on the brink of famine.",4590,"Coordination"
2390304,"Nigeria: Humanitarian Dashboard (January - November 2017) **Situation Overview**

The crisis in Nigeria’s north-east is one of the most severe in the world, with 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2017 in the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, out of whom 6.9 million are targeted for assistance. Now in its ninth year, the crisis shows no sign of abating. Insecurity continues to pose major challenges in delivering assistance, especially with the dry season enabling an intensification of hostilities between the Nigerian armed forces and non-state armed groups. Additionally, about 926,000 people remain completely inaccessible to humanitarian organisations. As the year draws to a close, the various sectors of the response are carrying out assessments to refine the planning of programmes for 2018, and carrying out various lessons-learnt exercises to improve the quality of the response moving forward.",4590,"Coordination"
2390024,"North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, November 2017 **Operational Overview**

The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains severe due to ongoing conflict, continued internal displacement and the unpredictable return of refugees from neighbouring countries. New population movements continued to be recorded in November, with 1,862 new arrivals in Gwoza, followed by 729 in Askira/Uba, 428 in Mafa, 373 in Ngala and 358 in Madagali; Jere and Chibok recorded relatively high numbers of departures. Additionally, recent important and unexpected arrivals of population (over 13,000 persons) were recorded in Nganzai, Konduga and Magumeri where there is very limited partner presence due to insecurity and lack of access. Humanitarian agencies mobilised to address to the most urgent needs, in particular through the rapid response mechanism (RRM), filling the most pressing gaps until sectors can plan and deliver a comprehensive response.  

While food security has improved throughout the north-east in 2017 as a result of a massive scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihoods assistance, the situation remains extremely fragile with many households, particularly in Borno State, mainly dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic food and livelihood needs. Many remain forced to resort to negative coping strategies to access food. The most recent Cadre Harmonisé analysis (finalised in November) projects that, without adequate and timely humanitarian assistance, 3.7 million individuals will be facing critical levels of food insecurity during the 2018 lean season (June through September). The figure does not include four Borno State local government areas (LGAs) where data could not be collected due to access constraints (in Abadam, Guzamala and Marte) or lack of partner capacity (in Kala/Balge).  

In addition to food insecurity, issues of protection continue to cause extremely serious concern throughout the north-east, including person-borne explosive device attacks in or near IDP camps, and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of internally displaced persons (IDPs) by those supposed to protect them, as was reported in Bama (Borno State). In addition, on 1 November, four pupils in a primary school in Kwaya Kusar, Borno State, were gruesomely attacked. Two of them died and the other two were severely wounded. This direct attack against an educational institution, the first one in two years, may impact school attendance as parents may fear for their children’s lives. In addition, following the resurgence of attacks by non-state armed groups in some parts of Adamawa State, 12 primary schools have been closed, affecting education continuity for the children enrolled in those schools.  

The dry season has also allowed the work on ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs to accelerate and, to date, five out of the nine planned hubs are complete (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza). Another four (Monguno, Damasak, Banki and Rann) are expected to be fully operational by early 2018. As these hubs offer secure accommodation and Internet connectivity for aid workers, they are instrumental in supporting effective last-mile aid delivery and enhancing local coordination.  

With close to 70 per cent (US$731 million out of $1.05 billion) of the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) funding requirements received before year-end, the humanitarian response in Nigeria is one of the world’s best funded. Thanks to the generous support of donors, many sectors have been able to meet their targets on key life-saving activities. However, a critical gap remained throughout the year in the funding of the Response and Recovery Planning sector. This has hampered the humanitarian agencies’ ability to deliver comprehensive livelihood support to affected people, has slowed down debris removal activities in major towns, and overall limited early recovery work across north-east Nigeria.  

As the year draws to a close, sectors and humanitarian organisations continued to carry out various programme-based and areabased needs assessments which are contributing to drafting the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan, to be finalised respectively by mid-December and early January.",4590,"Coordination"
2389979,"Kenya: Food Assistance Fact Sheet -  December 21, 2017 **Situation**

- Below-average rainfall during the 2016 rainy seasons and the 2017 March-to-May rainy season has led to severe drought and deteriorating food security and nutrition conditions in northern and southeastern parts of Kenya. The 2017 October-to-December rainy season has been above average across most of the country, leading to slight improvements in water and pasture availability for livestock. As a result, food security in some pastoral households is improving to Stressed (IPC 2) levels. However, staple food prices remain high after several consecutive below-average harvests, and the majority of poor pastoral households will likely continue to face Crisis (IPC 3) levels of acute food insecurity through January 2018, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).

- High levels of malnutrition persist, with approximately 370,000 children younger than five years of age and 37,000 pregnant and lactating women experiencing acute malnutrition.

- According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Kenya hosts more than 489,000 refugees. As of October 2017, Kenya hosted more than 286,500 Somalis and 111,000 South Sudanese fleeing conflict and food insecurity in their own countries. While the number of Somali refugees has decreased since 2016 due to repatriations, the number of South Sudanese has increased as insecurity worsens in South Sudan.

**Response**

- The USAID Office of Food for Peace (FFP) partners with the UN World Food Program (WFP) to provide relief and build resilience among the most vulnerable populations in Kenya. In the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) counties, FFP supports food-insecure Kenyans by providing cash transfers or food in exchange for work on improving community assets, such as rehabilitating local roads or irrigation systems. FFP also provides funding and in-kind, ready-to-use therapeutic foods to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in the ASALs and among refugee populations in Kenya. FFP provided support to WFP for contingency planning for possible violence and displacement associated with the 2017 Kenyan general elections, as well as supplementary nutritious foods for children younger than five years of age and pregnant and lactating women in areas with the highest levels of acute malnutrition.

- FFP supports refugees living in the Dadaab and Kakuma camps, and their host communities, through direct food distributions, education on maternal and child health, livelihoods training, and supplementary and therapeutic nutritious food. FFP also supports WFP’s refugee operation by providing cash-based transfers for food, support for local procurement of cereals and pulses, and a pilot program to develop refugee-managed milling operations.",4590,"Coordination"

2389259,"Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, remarks at the opening of the Centre for Humanitarian Data The Hague, the Netherlands, 22 December 2017

*As prepared for delivery*

Thank you to Minister Sigrid Kaag and her excellent team, and to Mayor Krikke and the municipality of The Hague, for hosting and supporting us here at the Centre for Humanitarian Data. We are also absolutely thrilled to do this with the Government of the Netherlands.

I am also pleased to see so many members of the UN family here, including Vitaly Vanshelboim of the UN Office for Project Services, who are a critical partner for us in the Centre as well as representatives of OCHA’s generous donors.

Historically, many millions of people across the planet have died in famines, floods, fighting and other disasters, without anyone elsewhere in the world ever knowing it was happening. Modern technology means that we can now see pretty much everything, everywhere, all the time.

When people see suffering, in other places, the natural human reaction is to want to help. With today’s technology, we have the chance to identify problems as they appear, predict what will happen next and organize an effective response. The potential for saving lives and reducing suffering is literally enormous.

In 2014, OCHA launched the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) to improve data sharing. HDX is now used in every active crisis around the world including Bangladesh, Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan, and by users across some 165 countries. New organizations join HDX every week. Soon Facebook will become a member too, recognizing the values we attach to partnerships with business.

The Centre for Humanitarian Data is the next leg of this journey. Going far beyond HDX, it aims to use high quality data to identify and predict humanitarian problems. And then to enable responders to take action much faster, better, and more cheaply than is possible at the moment. One of the challenges then for the centre is to make sure it is doing more that is actionable.

I am also pleased that the Centre for Humanitarian Data is part of The Hague Humanity Hub. By creating an open workspace in which technology companies, academics, humanitarian groups and others can collaborate, the Hub will create a new kind of business model that befits the humanitarian challenges of the 21st century.

2388854,"New Humanitarian Centre in the Netherlands Will Put Data to Work for People in Crises (The Hague, 22 December 2017): The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, today in The Hague opened the Centre for Humanitarian Data which aims to significantly boost real-time exchange and use of data to better respond to humanitarian crises worldwide.

At the centre, data experts and humanitarians will work together to process and visualize data to rapidly gain insight into the needs of affected people and the response by humanitarian partners. Partners will develop and promote data policies, for example to ensure that sensitive data is protected, and offer training in data skills.

The centre is established and managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and is supported by the Government of the Netherlands. It is part of The Hague Humanity Hub, an open, collaborative work environment established by the city.

“OCHA’s new Centre for Humanitarian Data is a signpost to the future. It shows how the technologies that are revolutionizing every aspect of our lives can be harnessed to help and support vulnerable people all over the world,” said the Secretary-General. “This centre will help humanitarians to make informed and responsible decisions to meet people’s most urgent needs.”

The centre will manage the Humanitarian Data Exchange, OCHA’s open platform for accessing, sharing and using data from hundreds of organizations and dozens of humanitarian emergencies such as Yemen, Somalia and the Rohingya refugee crisis. The aim is to speed up the flow of data from collection to use so that aid groups will have access to timely information about often rapidly evolving situations.

Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Sigrid Kaag, welcomed the opening of the Centre: “We want innovation to change and improve aid to people most heavily affected by conflicts or natural disasters. The innovative Centre for Humanitarian Data helps us achieve that change. Institutional data sharing agreements, data standards adoption and technical integration enables essential data to move faster across partner systems and accomplish a more efficient and, equally important, more inclusive aid system in which no one is left behind.”

So far, the Health Cluster funding for HRP 2017 remains at 18%. With the continued armed conflict and resultant displacement and diseases, the needs are increasing while the health response is limited. Impaired access to populations in need continue to increase the cost of operations. As the heavy rains continue and security remains unpredictable, the humanitarian health situation can only get worse during the remaining part of the year.

The Health cluster hosted 4 emergency responders meetings where partners discussed emerging contextual and disease trends, gaps and response. Through the ICWG prioritization, the Health Cluster responded with essential life-saving health services in Mvolo, Pading, and Weinchol.

To reduce malaria as well as other vector borne diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and diarrhoeal diseases, the MENTOR Initiative conducted vector control activities including spraying of mosquito breeding sites, indoor residual spraying of shelters and fly control of open defecation sites, latrines and garbage sites in Bentiu and Malakal PoC as well as in Maban.

**Private sector accompanies Relief Chief to drought-stricken Kenyan county**
 
A United Nations team led by the Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien, government officials and HPPP chair [Equity Bank](http://equitybankgroup.com/) visited the remote village of Bandarero in Moyale, Marsabit County on March 4 to assess and [raise awareness of the effects of drought.](http://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-flash-appeal-2017)

Many of the families they met said they had little access to water, their livestock had perished, and their children were struggling to stay in school.

“I am here to say that the international community stands with you, and together we will get through these difficult times. We must act early, together, now,” O’Brien told affected families.

The delegation witnessed firsthand the transfer payment system used to dispense cash to drought-affected communities through the support of Equity Bank in collaboration with the [National Drought Management Authority.](http://www.ndma.go.ke/)

The [Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP)](http://www.hsnp.or.ke/) is active in 4 counties - Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera - and targets 68,000 people.

**Equity Bank supports cash transfers of KSH 234 million to drought-hit Kenyans**

On 12 March 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta underscored the importance of public-private partnerships in the mitigation of the impacts of drought on communities living in arid and semi arid areas in northern Kenya.

Presiding over the announcement that Equity Bank would disburse KSH 234 million to vulnerable households on behalf of the Government of Kenya, President Kenyatta noted that cash transfers offer recipients choices. “This will improve living standards for communities living in the arid and semi-arid lands,” he said.

The British High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey lauded Equity Bank’s role in identifying and making payments to beneficiaries through the use of biometric technology. “Instead of donors deciding what is good for people, people are deciding what is good for themselves, whether they want to add on to their livestock numbers or start a small business to sustain their families. This is improving inclusion across Turkana,” he said.

The Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) is a cash transfer programme designed for the extremely poor in the counties of Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera. It is managed by the National Drought Management Authority under the Ministry of Devolution and Planning. The programme provides regular and emergency cash transfers to communities severely affected by drought. It is funded by the Government of Kenya, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and Australian Aid.

Equity Bank disburses cash transfers to vulnerable families in remote areas. The Bank has engaged GPRS and VSAT technologies to ensure the cash is distributed. HSNP's Equity Bank payment system has proven to be effective, efficient and transparent.

Thuraya: Communicating for credible elections & effective water management


From restoring critical communications during and after natural disasters to coordinating emergency response, satellite technology often serves as the backbone to successful relief and support operations. Relief agencies are increasingly reliant on mobile satellite services (MSS) for their robustness and wide coverage to facilitate a timely and efficient humanitarian response.

**Communicating for credible elections**

Thuraya SatSleeve + and XT-PRO handsets are used to share and monitor fair election results over satellite communications. In East Africa, Thuraya is part of the HPPP’s Election Preparedness/ Contingency Working Group.

During Kenya's 2016 by-elections, Thuraya was contacted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the regulatory agency responsible for conducting and supervising referenda and elections. They needed to achieve full and immediate transmission of results, because a delay in the confirmation of election results and declaration of winners raises concerns over the credibility of the electoral process. Four by-elections were being held in county assembly wards that had limited or no terrestrial coverage.

A joint team from Thuraya and Airtel Africa created a 14-day support programme. IEBC election officers participated in training and a results simulation exercise. Thuraya also provided technical support on election day.

The results were comprehensive: Thuraya was able to confirm 100% transmission results from remote county assembly wards using Thuraya handsets, enhancing the credibility of the electoral process.

Monitoring groundwater for effective drought response
To manage water scarcity in communities affected by drought, Thuraya works through various system integrators, using robust and secure M2M two-way communication terminals and services.

The Thuraya M2M FT-2225 terminal connects to water sensors that send data updates in real time to water management platforms over Thuraya’s  satellites. This helps experts collect and analyze data with the goal of monitoring and controlling ground water levels for effective resource management in regions such as Africa and the Middle East.",4590,"Coordination"

- As of 19 December 2017, a total of 1841 cases suspected with diphtheria have been reported, of whom 109 presented at the treating health facilities on 19 December 2017. A total of 22 deaths have been recorded so far.

- Vaccination started in Ukhia and Teknaf on 12 December for children under 7 with pentavalent, pneumococcal, and bivalent oral polio vaccines and on 17 December for children from 7 up to 15 years with tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine.

- The current outbreak is mainly occurring within the displaced Rohingya population living in the Balukali makeshift and extension camps. Cases are also being reported from the Kutupalong extension, Thangkhali, Jamtoli, and Nyapara camps. This population is also affected by malnutrition, low routine immunization coverage, and poor access to clean water and sanitation facilities.

- Strengthening case-management capacity, contact tracing, provision of chemoprophylaxis, immunization against diphtheria covering a wide age range combined with clear health messaging are key to reducing the spread and impact of this outbreak.

- A diphtheria core committee chaired by the Civil Surgeon of Cox’s Bazar, has been formalized with WHO facilitation. Key tasks such as epidemiology, case management, risk communication, laboratory confirmation, vaccination, and logistics are being coordinated by the sub-groups of this core committee.

- The Director General of Health Service, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Bangladesh visited Cox’s bazar and the camps for three days to take stock of the situation and direct concerted clinical and public health operations to manage the outbreak.",4590,"Coordination"

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**   

The IOM DTM Round XIX (October 2017) estimates that a total of 1.57 million people remain internally displaced across the three northeast states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 85 per cent are in Borno alone. This represents a decrease of about 3 per cent as compared to Round XVIII (August 2017). The reduction is explained by the movement of people to the newly accessible areas in Borno State. Children represent 56 per cent of the total IDP population.  
During the reporting period, a total of 2,641 new arrivals were registered in 16 LGAs in Borno and 4 LGAs in Adamawa (IOM DTM ETT Report: No. 39; No.40). These ongoing arrivals are increasing the pressure on the delivery of humanitarian services in the IDP settlements in terms of shelter, health and nutrition, provision of food and access to sanitation. With the upcoming dry season and improved road access, it is expected that hostilities will intensify leading to increased population displacement.  
The number of cholera cases continued to decrease during the reporting period and as of 15th November 2017, the total number of confirmed and suspected cholera cases reached 5,340, with 61 deaths (CFR = 1.1 per cent): 2,686 cases in the Muna corridor (Jere LGA); 1,758 cases in Monguno and 82 cases in Guzamala. The total number of cases reported from Dikwa, MMC and Mafa stand at 736, 58 and 20 respectively and have remained so for over 3 weeks. Despite this improvement, active case finding and cholera prevention activities by UNICEF and partners continue in all the identified hotspots.",4590,"Coordination"
2388279,"UNICEF Syria Crisis Situation Report (Humanitarian Results) - November 2017 **Highlights**

- As of 18 December 2017, the UNICEF 2017/18 winter response in Syria and Syrian refugee host countries reached over 630,000 children but remains 58% underfunded (out of US$72 million appeal) and 880,000 children remain in dire need for support.

- In Syria, the escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta and limited access of humanitarian deliveries and commercial goods has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, half of them children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since January 2017. In the same month, UNICEF reached more than 340,000 people in hard-to-reach locations (including 27,000 people in besieged locations) with life-saving interventions and critical services in the areas of WASH, education, health and nutrition and child protection.

- In November in Turkey, over 167,000 Syrian refugee children benefitted from the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education (CCTE) for attending school regularly in preceding months, a nearly 22% increase in beneficiaries over the previous payment in September. Approximately 82% of children receiving the CCTE in November also benefitted from the Emergency Social Safety Net programme, which helped reach close to 1.1 million refugees to date.

- In Lebanon, UNICEF WASH response to 190,000 people living in informal settlements (population of 272,000) is facing a critical funding shortage of US$ 26.5 million to sustain services beyond April 2018. To pre-empt the funding shortfall, a shift from full service coverage is being undertaken to mainly focus on the most vulnerable, semi-temporary costeffective water and wastewater facilities, and the establishment of a surveillance mechanism to identify possible communicable disease outbreak and trigger an immediate Health and WASH joint response.

- The number of unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) in Egypt has increased to nearly 2,500 in 2017 compared to 1,800 last year including some Syrian refugees. Key needs identified for this highly vulnerable group include legal documentation, legal support, cash assistance, education and child protection services. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs:** Humanitarian needs remained critical in Syria throughout November. Though the overall level of violence decreased in some areas of the country (primarily those linked to de-escalation zones in southern Syria, northern Homs), violence escalated and or remained high elsewhere such as in Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Raqqa and Deir-Ez-Zour where fighting and anti-ISIL operations continue to inflict high civilian casualties. The escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta along with limited access of humanitarian and commercial shipments has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, especially children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since the last survey conducted in January 20171 . 

Furthermore, fighting between armed opposition groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Nour al-Din al-Zenki (NDZ) led to the disruption of humanitarian services in western rural Aleppo. Some humanitarian services were suspended from November 14 to 18 over concerns for the security of staff. Clashes between non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and the Government of Syria resulted in shelling in southern rural Aleppo, triggering a displacement of more than 10,000 residents and 2,600 internally displaced people (IDPs)2 . 

A rise in military clashes led to a displacement of more than 90,000 IDPs from As-Saan, Hamra and Oqierbat in Hama governorate and Tamanah in southern Idleb to move northward into Idleb governorate in the past two months.3 In Raqqa, displaced populations are returning to areas with a high prevalence of unexploded ordinances and landmines. Humanitarian partners estimate more than 200 related trauma cases since cessation of military activities in Raqqa City, particularly among children, highlighting the importance of scalingup life-saving mine risk education in prior active conflict zones. The destruction of education and health4 infrastructure along with further attacks and internal displacement continues to limit access to these essential services for children throughout the country. Subsequently, an estimated 1.7 million children remain out-of-school and 200,000 others have missed-out on basic immunization and polio. 

In total, Jordan now hosts 2.7 million refugees, including 655,588 registered Syrian refugees (51 per cent children)5 . A population of approximately 40,000 Syrians remain along Jordan’s northeast desert border near Rukban, of whom 80 per cent are estimated to be women and children, with a significant percentage of households headed by females. Since the closure of the border in June 2016, only modest support has been possible from the Jordanian side of the berm, including the provision of safe water and access to basic health services, primarily through the UN and in close coordination with the Jordanian Armed Forces. The UNICEF-supported clinic near Rukban has provided around 500 medical consultations in November, a decrease from services provided in the previous month (1,002 consultations) due to limited access. The daily provision of safe water by UNICEF and access to some health services remain the only regular humanitarian assistance available for the vulnerable population at the Berm. 

Reports of minor clashes between Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) armed forces (Peshmerga), Iraq Security Forces (ISF) and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) continued in the reporting month, albeit no significant displacement. As in the previous month, armed conflict remained largely far from Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) areas where Syrian refugees reside. There has been no resolution to ongoing political tension between the KRG in Erbil and the federal Government of Iraq since the referendum on the former’s independence in September, however political dialogue is ongoing. As of November, Iraq is hosting 246,974 registered Syrian refugees including over 107,187 children 6 . Although overall numbers have remained largely static, movements continue between Syria and Iraq at the Peshkhabour border crossing. Per information received from border authorities, some 5,100 Syrians arrived in the KRI in September alone, of these, more than 3,800 were readmittances after prior authorization by border authorities to return to Syria.7 The humanitarian situation of Syrian refugees in Iraq has remained largely the same throughout 2017. With around 40 per cent of Syrian refugees under 18, the need for access to formal education remains high. Although Syrian refugees in camps remain well served, Syrian refugees in host communities may not have regular access to primary healthcare, regular safe water supply or adequate sanitation. In this prolonged refugee crisis, there is need to identify and strengthen community-based child protection networks to identify child protection issues and advocate for child-focused solutions. 

Lebanon continues to host an estimated 1.5 million refugees (over one million registered with UNHCR8 ). The sudden resignation of the Prime Minister Saad Hariri on 4 November heightened the sense of an impending crisis. While the situation normalized with his return to Lebanon, the incident exposed a precarious political context and its potential impact on the region. UNICEF continues to face critical funding shortages in Informal Settlements (US$26.5 million gap) to meet the needs of 190,000 people (estimated population of 272,000) for WASH as well as for Health (US$ 2.8 million gap). Given the expected decrease in humanitarian funding next year, UNICEF is transitioning towards strategic and longer-term systems strengthening in the areas of the No Lost Generation initiatives (child protection, youth, education and social protection) as well as child survival (health and WASH), while maintaining a more durable humanitarian response in light of ongoing needs and current instability.  
In November, nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, including over 1.5 million children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.9 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, 2,052 refugees and migrants were rescued or apprehended on their sea journey from Turkey to Greece, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece. Under the framework of the EU-Turkey Statement, seven rounds of returns took place for 75 people in November (including two accompanied children)10, bringing the total number of readmissions to 1,469 since the Statement came into effect in March 2016. 

In Egypt, the total number of registered Syrian refugees and asylum seekers has reached over 124,000, an increase from the 117,591 registered in January 2017. Forty per cent of new Syrian arrivals are coming illegally from the Sudanese border leading to an increased number of detentions. UNICEF has access to the 23 detention centres where it provides health assistance, including vaccines, hygiene kits and non-food items, with a focus on young and adolescent girls. 

The Government of Egypt grants Syrian refugee children access to education in public schools under the same rules and regulations that apply to Egyptian nationals. However, absorbing the number of Syrian students in public schools is a persistent constraint due to high class density and limited number of teachers relative to students. Other challenges to enrolment include strict documentation requirements, safety measures (inside and outside classrooms) and lack of quality teaching in public schools. Currently, an estimated 39,000 children remain out-of-school. The number of unaccompanied and separated children has increased to about 2,50011 compared to 1,800 last year. Key needs include issuance of legal documentation to help qualify for legal support and cash assistance, in addition to education, child protection services.",4590,"Coordination"

**Operational Context**

**Arrivals and border movements**

Since 25 August this year some 655,000 refugees have fled targeted violence and serious human rights violations in Rakhine State, Myanmar. UNHCR estimates that average arrival rates have dropped from 745 per day in November to 100 per day so far this month.  

UNHCR identified more than 40 border points used by refugees to cross into Bangladesh since the start of the crisis. Currently, refugees arrive mainly through two entry points - Sabrang and Anjumanpara. The availability of boats, boat fares, information provided by relatives on previous crossings, presence of landmines, and border surveillance generally determine the points of crossing.  

The Government and people of Bangladesh have shown extraordinary generosity in keeping the country’s borders open and shared their resources with refugees from Myanmar. Newly arrived refugees are settling in the border areas in the south-east of Bangladesh, in Cox’s Bazar, where an estimated 307,500 refugees were already living. The vast majority are staying in a large and densely populated settlement called Kutupalong. The terrain of the camps is hilly and prone to landslides, flooding, whilst proximity to the coast also makes the area prone to cyclones. Weather conditions, the challenging terrain, and the lack of roads limit access to the refugees, especially those living in more remote areas of the spontaneous settlements. UNHCR has funded a road to ensure better access, working closely with Bangladesh’s armed forces.  

**Refugee population and protection needs**

In order to develop a better understanding of the refugee population and of their needs UNHCR launched a family counting exercise. This exercise will aim to complement the Government’s on-going registration efforts. UNHCR teams have identified family composition in its counting exercise and gathered other information that will assist with response efforts. This exercise is proving instrumental in the development and implementation of protection activities and the provision of targeted assistance.  

Of the 753,238 individuals counted, the majority (69%) are from Maungdaw, while 24% are from Buthidaung in northern Rakhine State, Myanmar. Some 52% are women or girls, while 54% are children under 18 years of age. A significant number of families (31%) have at least one member who has specific needs, including single mothers (16%), serious medical conditions (4%), elderly people (4%), and people with disability (5%), among others.  

UNHCR is working closely with the Government of Bangladesh and partners to provide protection and assistance to the refugees and to support host populations affected by the influx. The Office also continues to work to develop sites in the extended areas of Kutupalong along with ensuring that basic infrastructure is in place where refugees settle.  

On 23 November, the Governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a bilateral ‘arrangement’ on the return of refugees to Myanmar. UNHCR continues to engage with both governments outlining UNHCR’s established role in voluntary return processes, why it is important as a means of ensuring refugee concerns are represented, and to address the most pressing aspects of the arrangement, including its scope, timeframe, conditions, and any other criteria that will help it meet international standards for voluntary return. Refugees will need accurate information in order to make their own well-informed choices on voluntary return to Myanmar. Based on the reports of Rohingya refugees arriving in Bangladesh and of human rights organization, conditions in Myanmar’s Rakhine State are not yet conducive to enable safe and sustainable return for many refugees. Confidence-building measures will be required on the ground in Rakhine State as well as other measures, such as unhindered access for UNHCR to conduct protection monitoring of refugee returns.",4590,"Coordination"

- Over 167,000 refugee children benefitted from a conditional cash transfer for education (CCTE) payment for attending school regularly in preceding months – a 22% increase over the September payment.

- Between April-November, UNICEF and NGO partner ASAM distributed almost 41,800 protection vouchers to more than 18,800 vulnerable refugee families in six provinces, benefitting over 57,700 children.

- UNICEF provided support to the Ministry of Health for a third vaccination campaign for refugee and migrant children under five. Over 376,000 children were screened in 20 provinces, 117,000 of whom were found to have missed doses and vaccinated accordingly.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

In November, the number of registered refugees and asylum seekers in Turkey stood at over 3.7 million. Nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, of which 1.5 million are children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.

Meanwhile, over 3,200 refugees and migrants successfully journeyed by sea from Turkey to Greece in November, a 22% decrease compared to October. An estimated 35% of those who crossed are believed to be children.2 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, an additional 2,052 people were rescued or apprehended, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece.

2387529,"Evaluation of Sida’s ITP approach for Capacity Development **Executive Summary**

**Background**

Sida has requested this evaluation in order to combine learnings from previous evaluations with an evaluation of recent years’ methods’ development. The intent is to inform the future work of CAPDEV with the International Training Programme (ITP) as a capacity building instrument and provide recommendations for adaptations for future use.

The evaluation has four main evaluation areas: 1) Goals and goal fulfilment, 2)  
Methodological assumptions and methods, 3) Anti-corruption and cross-cutting issues and 4) The unique selling point of the ITP. The main focus shall be on ITPs as outlined in the Results strategy for Capacity development & exchanges 2014-2017, but several evaluation questions motivate a broader scope. Tanzania has been identified by Sida for field visit and in-depth case study.

The evaluation was carried out by a team of five consultants between May and September 2017. The evaluation included interviews with former participants, supervisors and Embassy personnel in Tanzania and with representatives of ITP organisers, Sida and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sweden. An internet based survey has been sent to nearly 10 000 persons and responded to by nearly 2 800.  
Documents reviewed include evaluations, programme documents, strategies and other relevant studies and reports.

**Sida’s International Training Programmes (ITPs)**

Sida finances International Training Programmes (ITPs) in support of capacity building in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Middle Income Countries (MICs).  
The goal is to achieve good competence and high capacity in organisations in developing countries to drive change processes for more effective poverty reduction.  
This goal is intended to support Sida’s “Results strategy for capacity development and exchanges 2014-2017”, by contributing to

 Increased skills at the individual level and strengthened capacity of organisations to drive change for effective poverty reduction, strengthened rights perspective, and sustainable development.

 Increased contacts and established relationships between individuals, organisations and institutions in other countries and Sweden.

The first ITPs were implemented in the 1980s. Participant data for the early years have not been found, but data extracted from Sida’s database of ITP participants for 2008 – 2017 shows that during these years, over 10 600 persons from 117 countries participated in an ITP. Of these approximately 46% are women. A total of 182 ITP rounds have been implemented by 39 different organisers. Sida notes, however, that there have been problems with data quality and the numbers may not be fully accurate.

**Main findings**

There is no explicit Theory of Change for the ITP. It contributes to the goals of the Results strategy for capacity development and exchanges 2014-2017 but its contribution rests on a number of more or less explicit assumptions, most importantly that capacity development of a number of persons will have a positive effect on organisational capacity and change processes that contribute to poverty reduction.  
The goal of the ITP is in line with relevant Swedish policy frameworks and strategies for development cooperation. A large number of individuals have been trained – presumably tens of thousands although this is not confirmed. A change project is an important part of the ITP methodology and, based on interviews and survey, we assess that less than half of the participants implemented their change project. There are several examples of participants that have contributed to changes that can in turn be assumed to have a positive effect on poverty reduction (such as changed national policies and changed curricula in educations). There is no request from Sida for follow-up of participants and change projects after the end of the ITP.  
The selection of participants, thematic areas and countries is relevant but could be more focused and strategic. A majority of the participants remain in the same organisation or sector after they attend the ITP.

The Sweden phase (seen as contributing to an understanding of “how things can be done differently”), peer-to-peer learning, mentoring and being outside the day-to-day context contribute to the positive results of the ITP. Hindering factors for implementing change projects were mainly related to lack of support from the participants’ organisations, while clustering of participants had a positive effect.

Networks created during ITPs or ITP rounds worked better if linked to other networks or supported by the programme organiser. A majority of survey respondents had contact with other ITP participants, but interviews with participants gave the impression that these were more of a social than professional nature, and tended to cease after some time.

The ITP and recent methodological developments are mainly in line with recent developments in the Capacity Development literature. The methodological development has not yet been fully implemented but addresses some of the identified weaknesses.

Anti-corruption and cross-cutting issues are not sufficiently covered. The exception is gender issues and cross-cutting issues that coincide with the thematic area of the ITP.  
The unique selling point (USP) of the ITP is, to participants, related to “soft” variables: the eye-opening effect of gaining a new perspective on how things can be done as well as challenges encountered in other contexts, the mix of participants from different countries and the role-modelling of seeing how the programme was implemented (methods, scheduling, gender roles etc.). To Sida a main advantage is secure yet flexible funding, and to Sweden a strong but not yet utilised USP is the large resource pool of former ITP participants.

**Main conclusions**

The ITP has been effective at capacity development of individuals but less effective at capacity development of organisations. The extent to which the ITP has contributed to poverty reduction cannot be assessed.

There is no explicit Theory of Change for the ITP instrument. There is a method and process which covers the different phases of the training programme, some general assumptions as presented in the terms of reference and individual ITPs have intervention logics developed by the organisers. The ITP instrument shall contribute to Sida’s results strategy for capacity development but there is no explicit link between the outputs of the ITP – trained individuals – and the intended long-run outcome or impact – reduced poverty.

There is to some extent continued contact between ITP participants and there are isolated examples of functioning professional networks, but no formalised or systematic way of sustaining these.

The recent methodological developments, including increased focus on organisational buy-in, longer engagement period and efforts at creating a critical mass are in line with general knowledge of what works in capacity development.  
The attention paid by Sida and organisers to anti-corruption and other cross-cutting issues is not sufficient.

The Unique Selling Point of the ITP lies mainly in ”soft variables”, and in the, untapped, pool of former participants.

**Recommendations**

The link to other development and capacity development programmes and approaches should be strengthened to increase the effect of the ITP at the organisational and national level and over time.

To achieve this, Sida and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should jointly:

1. Review the goal of the ITP as an instrument for poverty reduction: In order to further shift the focus from individuals to organisations and poverty reduction, we recommend that an explicit Theory of Change for ITP is developed. This should clearly illustrate how the ITP is expected to contribute to Sida’s overall and capacity development strategies, as well as other Sida interventions.

2. Develop methods for ensuring that the ITP is better linked to other development interventions: Sida and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should jointly review ways of using the pool of former participants and their host organisations to identify what is needed for in order to better use the resource base of former ITP participants to further Sida goals. 

3. Develop systems for making the ITP more demand-based: Currently the ITP is to a large extent supply-driven. In order to make better use of the ITP instrument, and to better adapt it to other interventions, Sida and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should jointly develop systems for incorporating demands for ITPs from relevant national and multilateral stakeholders.

**Recommendations to Sida:**

1. Funding for networking: Sida should procure ITP contracts with a flexibility allowing for post programme networking intended to support the reduction of poverty ambitions.

2. Review and clarify selection criteria for participants and change projects:  
Sida should make a full shift to focus on organisations rather than individuals when identifying participants. There should be clear criteria for selection of participants, indicating what is prioritised – continuing the process towards creating a critical mass, identifying future young leaders or targeting persons already in decision-making positions.

3. Clustering and critical mass: The process towards creating critical mass should be continued and clusters of participants from the same organisation or thematic area in a country or region should be encouraged.

4. Anti-corruption and cross-cutting issues: Sida should clearly define which cross-cutting issues are relevant for which programmes, how they are to be treated and how much time should be spent on them. Sida should be prepared to support (public) organisers who lack competence or experience in anticorruption or cross-cutting issues, and follow-up how the organisers include the issues in the ITPs.

5. Use of local/regional resources: ITP organisers should be encouraged to explore ways of recruiting programme alumni or other qualified local resources to support participants and their supervisors in order to enhance organisational impact.

6. Monitoring and follow-up: Data to monitor progress of participant and organisational capacity development and change projects after the end of an ITP round should be routinely collected. A set of indicators that can be used across ITPs should be identified and data should be analysed to assess effectiveness of the ITP instrument.

7. Database of former participants: The database of former participants and their host organisations should be updated and upgraded. It shall be designed so that it is accessible to relevant stakeholders, with appropriate consideration of integrity issues.",4590,"Coordination"

- IOM and its partners are scaling up its Shelter and Non Food Items response through its distribution of over 88,500 blankets and emergency shelter, including bamboo bundles for over 1,500 families.  
‐ To respond to the Diphtheria outbreak, IOM is supporting a vaccination campaign for children under six years old through community workers through provision of support to vaccination teams on the ground. IOM is constructing three isolation and treatment centres to urgently increase case management and bed capacity and supporting contact tracing at several locations.  
‐ IOM has released its Needs and Population Monitoring (NPM) Round 7, assessing 1,635 locations hosting Rohingya refugees in collective sites and host communities.

**Situation Overview**

Since 25 August 2017, an estimated 655,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh fleeing violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, increasing the total Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar to 867,000. New arrivals are living in spontaneous settlements with increasing need of humanitarian assistance, including shelter and clean water, and sanitation.

In addition to ongoing challenges such as proper waste management and lack of motorable road access to transport building materials, another concern is the diphtheria outbreak.

According to WHO, between 8 November and 19 December, 1841 suspected case-patients with diphtheria were reported with 22 deaths. Cases have been reported from both Ukihya and Teknaf with urgent efforts required to scale up prevention and treatment response.

IOM works closely with the Government and the humanitarian community to meet the needs of the displaced population. IOM and its partners continue to scale up operations to respond to the needs of new arrivals, existing Rohingya, and affected host communities.",4590,"Coordination"

- Almost half of the 12.3 million population of Somalia, 5.5 million people, are in urgent need of emergency health services. Insecurity, displacement, poor health seeking practices, concentration of health facilities in urban areas, as well as the continuous spread of measles, AWD/ Cholera and complications arising from severe malnutrition has complicated health crises in Somalia.

- The health cluster through its partners has provided more than 2.9 million health consultations from the beginning of the year which is 68% of its yearly target. It has provided more than 265 thousand consultations in November alone which is 74% of its monthly target.

- Since the start of the year, a total of 78,560 cumulative cases of AWD/cholera recorded from health facilities across the country and 1,159 deaths have been reported in 55 districts of 16 regions across Somalia. No cholera related deaths have been reported in November in any region across Somalia

- The numbers of suspected cases of measles still remain at epidemic levels with 20,809 suspected cases of Measles reported mainly from Nugal, Mudug, Bari, Banadir and Lower Shabelle. Approximately 84% of these being under ten years of age. Although there has been a decline in recent months, the number of cases is 4 times as high as those reported in 2015 and 2016.",4590,"Coordination"
2386899,"Ukraine: Checkpoints - Humanitarian Snapshot  (as of 21 December 2017) **Overview**

Crossing the 457-km ‘contact line’ remains challenging for millions of women, men and children moving between the government (GCA) and non-government controlled areas (NGCA) of eastern Ukraine. Despite constant insecurity due to shelling, shooting, and mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination, approximately 1 million individual crossings were recorded in November 2017.

This is a 6 per cent decrease from October 2017. Most of the crossings are people seeking to maintain family ties, access basic goods and services, social benefits and pensions. Specific challenges in November include: the sharp drop in temperatures with the onset of winter and the impact from the reduced winter operating hours of the crossing points (EECPs). Roads are not well lit which also makes people feel unsafe whilst waiting. The facilities at the EECPs remain basic, particularly for the elderly, those with disabilities, children and pregnant women, who wait hours and sometimes days to cross. The facilities are often insufficient for dealing with times of high demand or non-existent in some locations. There is also increasing concern with the high level of mine and ERW contamination along the ‘contact line’ affecting hundreds of thousands of people.

On a positive note, ICRC completed partial reconstruction of the wooden pedestrian bridge at the EECP Stanytsia Luhanska in mid-December. This made the crossing more secure and less dangerous, especially in winter conditions. The pedestrian bridge is the only crossing point between the GCA and NGCA in Luhanska region, with over 8,000 people crossing on a daily basis. Some humanitarian agencies provide humanitarian assistance on both sides of the bridge and maintain first aid and heating points. However, much more is needed to meet the increased needs in this and other 4 official checkpoints that are located in Donetska province. It is hoped that the Zolote crossing point will reopen in the near future to provide car access in the Luhanska region to facilitate the movement of the civilian population.",4590,"Coordination"

- IDPs and returnees lack access to adequate services, livelihoods 

- USAID/OFDA provides support to vulnerable populations in Marawi and surrounding areas

**KEY DEVELOPMENTS**

- On October 23, the Government of the Philippines (GPH) announced the end of the five-month offensive against Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-affiliated armed groups in Marawi, the capital city of Lanao del Sur Province in the Philippines’ Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The GPH and relief actors are responding to continued humanitarian needs among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees. As of December 3, the GPH had registered nearly 354,000 IDPs.

- Of the 354,000 registered IDPs, approximately 97,000 had returned to Marawi as of December 10, according to the GPH Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). However, the GPH continues to restrict returns to the most-affected barangays—the smallest administrative divisions in the Philippines—due to widespread damage and destruction of homes and ongoing protection risks.

- Lack of basic services and livelihood opportunities in Marawi continue to hinder IDP returns. In addition, relief actors report that displaced populations residing in informal sites and host communities lack sufficient access to basic services.

- In FY 2017, USAID/OFDA provided $3 million to address the multi-sector needs of vulnerable populations in Marawi and neighboring areas, including through the provision of protection, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance.",4590,"Coordination"

However, while in Dominica 94 per cent of publicowned or funded schools have reopened, attendance is only at 68 per cent, possibly highlighting the impact of outward migration in the aftermath of the hurricane.

- The resettlement of Barbuda residents has not gone according to plan with only 34 per cent of the population signaling an intent to return from Antigua in the short-term; the main ferry service being out of operation and a decision that the previously state-funded passage (US$ 72 round trip) will now be borne directly by passengers.

- In Dominica, only eight per cent of people, mainly those living in the cities of Roseau and Portsmouth, have access to electricity. In the British Virgin Islands (BVI) only one-fifth of the population has restored power.

- Since the launch of the programme on 4 December, approximately 1,120 children from a target population of 6,000 vulnerable children and their families have been reached with the UNICEF-supported Emergency Cash Transfer Programme in Dominica.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

With the holiday season approaching, increasing pockets of population in hurricane-ravaged countries continue to see a gradual return to normalcy; but a large segment of the population is still struggling. While critical services, such as water, were restored to between 70 and 90 per cent of people (British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands, respectively), the return of electricity has been at a much slower rate. As of 13 December 2017, over 90 per cent of the population in Dominica was without electricity, while 80 per cent of the residents in British Virgin Islands and 40 per cent in Anguilla remain without power.  

The education sector continues to make strides to return to normal, even as a shift system and temporary learning spaces - such as UNICEF-provided tents - continue to be utilised. School enrolment figures in Antigua (Barbuda), Anguilla and Turks and Caicos Islands have reached or surpassed pre-hurricane levels, reflecting some movement between the islands, especially from Dominica. In Dominica, 94 per cent of all public-owned or funded pre-schools, primary and secondary schools have reopened, with an attendance rate of 68 per cent, according to pre-hurricane enrolment figures. However, considering migration trends since the hurricane,it is expected that the school-age population currently residing on the island is below the 18 September 2017 figure.  

The expected resettlement of Barbuda residents currently in Antigua, remains a critical concern. According to the *Intent to Return* survey conducted by IOM, only 34 per cent of approximately 1,600 people, want to return in the short term. The means of transportation from Antigua to the smaller sister island is also doubtful, with the main ferry being out of service, and a decision that Government will no longer bear the cost of the passage.",4590,"Coordination"

* On 7 and 19 September, 2017 Mexico was struck by two earthquakes of 8.2 and 7.1 magnitude on the Richter scale, respectively. The main affected states were Oaxaca, Chiapas, Mexico City, Puebla and Morelos. An estimated 7 million children live in these 5 states.

* Three months after the earthquakes, most children living in the most affected municipalities in the five states have gradually returned to school and to their normal lives.

* UNICEF's response plan during these three months focused on: 1)protecting children from violence, exploitation and abuse in shelters and public spaces of temporary refuge, as well as providing safe spaces and psychosocial support; 2) promoting educational continuity for children by advocating and supporting an early return to school and prevention of school drop-out; and 3) ensuring access to adequate hand-washing and sanitation facilities, as well as hygiene supplies.

* UNICEF established alliances with key partners from government, civil society and the private sector to establish 34 child friendly spaces, benefiting 3,126 children; train 353 teachers, who in turn will further train 5,296 teaching staff and 171 child-friendly space facilitators with tools and strategies for psychosocial support; establish 100 temporary learning spaces with water and sanitation facilities for severely damaged schools; distribute 410 schools-in-a-box benefiting 16,400 students; and distribute 20 early childhood development (ECD) kits, benefiting at least 800 children under 5 years of age.

* To date, the total value of funds raised by UNICEF amount to US$ 5,194,331.04, which surpassed the total initial ask of US$ 4.6 million.

* These actions were implemented initially in 24 priority municipalities, identified after five rapid assessment missions of UNICEF staff to the affected areas in the first 24-72 hours following the earthquakes. An additional 10 municipalities were included in the plan, where UNICEF staff identified urgent needs of children and women in the said areas, after subsequent missions.

- UNHCR and WFP prepared cash distribution for new arrivals who already registered with biometrics.  
Distribution started on 4th December in four localities around Gbadolite (Mobayi Mbongo, Lembo, Kambo and Mogoro). 20,870 refugees are targeted as well as 6,895 host families. 

- Partner ADES distributed farming and fishing kits (seedlings, farming tools, fishing tools and courtyard animals) to 730 refugees and 165 locals in Inke (Nord-Ubangi) and to 1,606 refugees and 605 locals from Boyabu (SudUbangi).

- In Inke camp, partner AIRD started the construction of 268 transitional shelters for new arrivals who were awaiting transfers from the border area.

**Update on Achievements**

**Operational Context**

New arrivals from CAR are mainly settled along the rivers Ubangi and Mbomou that constitute the border between CAR and DRC. Access to many areas is extremely difficult, because of lack of infrastructures (lack of passable roads / bridges) and in some cases because of the security situation. Incursions of armed groups from CAR into DRC were reported in Bondo territory and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and other armed groups are operating in Bas-Uele province.  
Conditions of new arrivals are extremely precarious: there is lack of shelter and core relief items, drinking water, food, sanitation and healthcare. They arrived with few belongings, and often their houses and property have been burned down or looted. Some of them are working in the fields of host community for little money or some food.",4590,"Coordination"
2385799,"Evaluation of the European Commission's interventions in the Humanitarian Health sector, 2014-2016 **Executive summary** 

This evaluation provides an independent assessment of the European Commission's Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations’ (DG ECHO’s) interventions in the humanitarian health sector during the period 2014 to 2016. The evaluation, launched by DG ECHO in November 2016, was carried out by ICF Consulting Services Ltd, with specialist inputs from humanitarian aid and health experts. 

The purpose of the evaluation was to analyse DG ECHO’s portfolio of health interventions between 2014-2016, reporting findings against seven core evaluation criteria specified in the Terms of Reference (relevance, coherence, connectedness, effectiveness, efficiency, EU Added Value and sustainability), in order to provide conclusions and recommendations to inform DG ECHO’s future interventions in this area and feed into the comprehensive Humanitarian Aid evaluation currently being undertaken. 

**Evaluation data sources and methods** 

Findings presented in this report are based on analysis and triangulation of the following data sources: 

 HOPE database records for all 553 DG ECHO-funded humanitarian health actions in Third Countries, reported between 2014-2016; 

 Project reports and FicheOps from a sample of 100 projects; 

 A sample of 52 Humanitarian Implementation Plans (HIPs); 

 Background literature from 55 references; 

 44 semi-structured stakeholder interviews with DG ECHO officers and partners, international donors and development actors; 

 An online survey gathering feedback from 32 DG ECHO partners (106 respondents); 

 Three field visits (exploring the External Assigned Revenues – ExAR – programme in Ivory Coast, DG ECHO’s health interventions in Jordan in response to the Syrian conflict; and DG ECHO’s humanitarian health response in South Sudan); and 

 A research-based case study on the global humanitarian response to the earthquake in Nepal in 2015.

**Validity of evaluation results**

As with any evaluation, limited data and data inconsistencies in some cases, along with the vested interests of different stakeholder groups may affect the quality and strength of findings.

It was not feasible to conduct a review of the full portfolio of health-focused actions, due to budget constraints, and given the high number of funded projects identified. A purposeful sample of 100 was therefore selected to capture the diversity of healthfocused actions funded by DG ECHO and the diversity of contexts in which the intervention took place.

The HOPE Database was the principle source for extracting health-funded actions. A number of inaccuracies related to defining health sub-categories of actions were found when further analysing the data. Findings within this evaluation report reflect the data extracted from the database, however caution was applied when providing views on the amount of funding provided by DG ECHO to each of the pre-defined subcategories, due to this inaccuracy. 

For practical reasons such as time and budget available for the evaluation, as well as security concerns, it was not possible to randomly select sites for fieldwork. The approach to selection of sites for fieldwork was therefore both purposeful and convenient, involving DG ECHO regional health experts and Headquarters (HQ).  
As far as possible, methodological limitations were overcome by using complementary research methods to enhance the reliability and validity of the data collected, and to provide the basis for cross-verification and triangulation of the evaluation results.  
Caution was exercised when interpreting data and reporting findings, and interests of different stakeholder groups were taken into account to address potential bias and to ensure objectivity. Input, review and validation with external thematic experts contributed to substantiate the validity of the evaluation results. However, in some cases it was not possible to make conclusive findings on the basis of existing evidence: where this was the case, it has been clearly highlighted in the report.

**Main findings**

This section provides summary findings from the descriptive analysis of actions, followed by in-depth analysis by evaluation theme. The final component of this section provides a summary of the main findings observed during the field visit to the ExAR Programme in Cote d’Ivoire.

**Overview of DG ECHO’s response in 2014-2016**

Between 2014 and 2016, DG ECHO funded 553 humanitarian health sector actions in third countries (equivalent to € 616.9 million of funding).

Most funded actions were multi-sectoral – although they had a health focus or health component – combining health activities with nutrition, food security and livelihoods and/or Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) activities. Breaking down health activities into health sub-sectors, the most common health sub-sectors covered by projects were primary health (67% of projects) followed by medical supplies (51%), reproductive health (48%), community outreach (47%), and, prevention and response to outbreaks/epidemics (42.5%). Just over a quarter of projects (27%) included Mental and Psycho-Social support.

Looking at funding breakdowns for country, partner and target group, South Sudan received the largest amount of humanitarian health funding over this period (€ 73 million or 11.4% of the total budget) while globally, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement was the partner organisation receiving the largest amount of funding (€ 121 million, 18.9%). In relation to target groups for funding, the majority of funding (73%) was provided to support IDPs and refugees. Natural disaster-affected populations received the smallest amount of funding. Nearly three quarters (72%) of DG ECHO funding was provided to projects that incorporated preparedness and response activities to epidemics (equivalent to 42.5% of projects).

**Relevance**

DG ECHO’s humanitarian health actions have been relevant to a moderate extent, however better needs assessments would improve relevance of funded actions.  
DG ECHO’s field network of Regional Health Experts (RHEs) were key in providing primary, up-to-date data, and, context-specific information to inform DG ECHO’s response strategies in the health sector. RHEs also engaged with DG ECHO implementing partners at design stage, by, for example, informing partners of thematic priorities and defining crisis-specific strategies. Evidence shows, however, that RHEs were not systematically consulted at the stage of the development of the HIPs or by DG ECHO TAs and partners on projects delivering health activities.",4590,"Coordination"

This operation update is to report on progress made from 1 May to 25 October 2017 against the programmes outlined in the revised [Emergency Plan of Action](https://reliefweb.int/node/1095836/). During the reporting period, some programmes did not materialize for various reasons, while some additional interventions have been supported by the Appeal due to the needs identified. The move to transit from emergency relief to greater integration-focused and longer term (and more sustainable) programmes continues to be reinforced with the development of an Operational Plan for Greece (pending approval) in 2018. The Emergency Appeal will run alongside the Operational Plan for the first half of 2018, after which the EA will be closed.

**A. Situation analysis**

**Description of the disaster**

Two years after the beginning of the migration crisis (in 2015), around 45,614 migrants remain on the mainland (32,158) and islands (13,456) of Greece, according to figures as of end of September by UNHCR.3 Compared to previous years, arrivals to Greece in 2017 have significantly decreased.  
However, during August and September 2017 there was a significant increase which created a critical situation of overcrowding in the Reception and Identification Centres (RICs) of the islands.  
In October 2017, UNHCR and other organisations in Greece have urged action on the islands to ease overcrowding, improve shelter, and stock and distribute appropriate and sufficient aid items. Nearly 5,000 refugees, mostly Syrian or Iraqi families, crossed from Turkey in September - a quarter of all arrivals this year.4 While that is a fraction of the nearly 1 million who arrived in 2015 - due to a European Union statement with Turkey - four of the five island camps are hosting two or three times as many people as they were designed for. In the RIC of Lesvos, Moria, for example, 1,500 people are currently living in makeshift tents with no insulation which raises concerns over the approaching of winter.5 The ‘Financial Plan 2017’ agreed between Greek and EU representatives (DG Home and DG ECHO) in February 2017 established that, with the exception of ECHO’s funding for alternative accommodation spaces and cash transfer programmes, provision of services in the island’s RICs is a responsibility of the Greek government with the EU financial support to the national programmes. 

While conditions on the camps in the mainland has improved as compared to the previous year, there continues to be a substantial number of protection challenges in Greece. Some, for example those linked to the lack of security and registration in camps, are longstanding and not able to be resolved in the absence of meaningful action by the Greek government. Other challenges are also emerging as populations transition into urban environments. Populations in camps, particularly in the islands, continue to experience overcrowding and inadequate standards of accommodation, ranging from tents to caravans shared with strangers and without adequate locks and other security mechanisms. There are frequent reports of both actual and apprehended violence from camp based populations, with rumours fuelling more fear, concern and community tensions. There is in general a lack of security in camps, and at many sites entry and egress are not controlled. Camp residents find that people come into the camp from outside completely unimpeded, often for the purpose of drugs, crime, sex work, and other problematic activities. People within camps, particularly women and children, are very afraid to move around at night as they do not know who is in the camp. There has been no MoMP registration in camps for many months (since May). People have continued to arrive in camps, resulting in large unregistered populations. These people cannot have access to cash, so are reliant on savings, generosity from friends and neighbours, or other sources of income in order to meet their basic needs.  
The lack of registration also means that people cannot be allocated a caravan officially, which is fuelling an exploitative black market whereby community leaders allocate caravans in return for payments amounting to hundreds of euros. 

From January until September (included) 2017 a total of 42,495 applications for international protection have been submitted to the Greek Asylum Service. The main countries of origins of asylum-seekers who have submitted an asylum application in 2017 were from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.6 In September 2017 the government stated that 10 camps out of the 20 will be closed by the end of the year and that the government will be responsible for managing healthcare related services in the camps from January 2018, further decreasing the role of NGOs in this context. Additionally, the aim is to move all migrants into rental accommodation schemes (by the end of 2018) instead of retaining the ‘camp based accommodation’ strategy. The UNHCR and its partners presented in July 2017 the newly launched Emergency Support to Integration & Accommodation programme (ESTIA)7 of the EU Humanitarian Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Directorate General, which aims to assist refugees and their families rent urban accommodation and provide them with cash assistance.  

Therefore, the fact that many people are now (or soon to be accommodated) in urban areas and that the EU Relocation programme ended in September 2017, leaves most people in Greece bound to live in the country, thus the need of integration services throughout the country is crucial. Facilitation of migrants and refugees to access public hospitals or public services to receive health insurance and tax numbers, language courses and access to the local job market are only some of the most important integration actions that need to be further explored and acted on.  

Therefore, while the urgency of meeting the basic needs for the new asylum seekers and migrants will continue, the more substantial question will be how to ensure that both basic needs of recognized refugees, as well as their inclusion and integration can be met by the services provided by, or through, the Greek government in the long run. This need will be most pronounced in the urban areas, which now host the majority of the migrant and refugee population.  

In general terms, the Emergency Appeal will focus on meeting the basic needs of the migrants, while the Annual Plan will emphasize the longer-term needs of migrants, as well as vulnerable Greeks, and where these two populations meet.

- According to Humanitarian Need Overview (HNO)-2018 chapeau, the most severe and acute needs across multiple sectors are concentrated in the areas of ongoing conflict, as well as areas hosting large numbers of IDPs. These includes almost all local government areas (LGAs) of Borno State, and areas of Adamawa and Yobe states that are bordering Borno.

- HNO-2018 further reflects that around 7.9 million conflict-affected people are in need of primary and secondary health interventions across six states, of whom 5.4 million are located in the three worst crisis-affected states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe. Conflict-affected people remain at significant risk of epidemic-prone diseases like cholera, measles, meningitis, and viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) such as Lassa and yellow fever.

- Due to evolving conflict dynamics in some areas as well as other various environmental/seasonal factors new population displacement is ongoing in different areas including Gajigana /Magumeri, Tungushe /Konduga , Rann, Ngala, Pulka, Gwoza, Banki, Dikwa and Monguno LGAs.

- Phase II of the Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign has been completed in MMC, Jere, Mafa and Konduga while vaccination is ongoing in Dikwa and Monguno. The cholera vaccination will protect the population for up to 3 years against cholera. The national Measles vaccination campaign has been completed in all LGAs of Borno state.

**Situation update**

The crisis in north-east Nigeria is one of the most severe in the world today. Across the six affected states of Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, Bauchi, Gombe and Taraba, 10.2 million people are estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018, of which 52 percent are women and girls, and 48 percent are men and boys. Children constitute 63 percent of those needing assistance. The most acute humanitarian needs are clearly concentrated in Borno state – and areas bordering Borno in Adamawa and Yobe states – where the crisis shows no sign of abating.  

The Health and WASH sectors partners have successfully controlled the cholera outbreak in MMC, Jere, Dikwa and Mafa LGAs, where no cases have reported for the last 6 weeks. Two weeks back cases were reported from the non-secure and with limited access Mairari ward in Guzamala, and Monguno LGA. Sensitization on cholera prevention messages and importance of good sanitation and Hygiene practices are ongoing in all affected areas to mitigate further risk of any outbreak. No new cases reported during the last two weeks. 
 
There is an ongoing relocation of IDPs to the new camp site in Bama LGA. The IDPs are currently living in General Hospital camp in a congested environment. Health Sector has identified a partner to deliver health care services at new location. WHO and Federal Government mobile teams can also be deployed based on the needs on ground.  

For coordinated health sector response to new displacement in Borno state, partners’ capacity mapping was consolidated to ensure effective service delivery and avoid duplication of services. The potential displacement locations are Gajigana/Magumeri, Tungushe/Konduga, Rann, Ngala, Pulka, Gwoza, Banki, Dikwa and Monguno LGAs. In terms of health sector response in different geographical areas, health partners/observers specially ICRC, MSF (France, Swiss, Spain, Belgium), UNICEF and WHO have wider coverage in all LGAs so in case of limited population influx the minimum health services are already available.  

Phase II of the Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign has been completed in MMC, Jere, Mafa and Konduga while vaccination is ongoing in Dikwa and Monguno. The second round of the cholera vaccination will protect the population for up to 3 years against cholera. The national Measles vaccination campaign has been completed in all LGAs of Borno state.

- WFP supported 629,500 Syrian refugees and 16,340 Palestinian refugees from Syria with food assistance. Additionally, 52,403 vulnerable Lebanese were reached under the National Poverty Targeting Programme.

- Approximately 90,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees continued receiving USD 27/person for food as well as a monthly household top-up of USD 175 to contribute towards additional food expenses and other non-food essentials, redeemable at an ATM throughout Lebanon With additional funding in December, approximately 115,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees will be targeted with this assistance. 

**WFP Assistance**

In Lebanon, WFP is implementing its programmes under the regional Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation (PRRO) 200987, which provides lifesaving food assistance to the most vulnerable individuals while also building the self-reliance of Syrians refugees and host communities.  
WFP’s primary form of assistance to Syrian refugees is provided through an electronic food voucher (e-card) system. E-cards can be used to purchase food from over 450 WFP-contracted shops. Starting from late 2016, WFP together with UNICEF, UNHCR and the Lebanon Cash Consortium introduced a common card, allowing a unified system for cash transfers.  

Based on a WFP-commissioned cash pilot study, which was conducted by the Boston Consulting Group in 2016, WFP began implementing unrestricted cash transfers in September for 170,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The refugees have the choice to redeem their basic food assistance either at any WFP-contracted shop or withraw cash from any ATM throughout the country. Additionally, in October approximately 90,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees began receiving monthly unrestricted cash. This assistance is redeemable at any ATM throughout the country.  

Moreover, WFP provides electronic food vouchers to more than 52,000 vulnerable Lebanese and 16,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria. This is done in partnership with the Ministry of Social Affairs and UNRWA.

As a means of transforming the refugee crisis into a development opportunity, WFP works with partners to provide income and skills-building opportunities for vulnerable Lebanese and Syrian refugees by building productive community assets. WFP currently implements over 111 livelihoods activities in 80 municipalities throughout the country with the support of cooperating partners, reaching 40,500 people in 2017.  

To ensure there is no lost generation of Syrian refugee children, WFP, alongside UNICEF, runs a cash for education programme. WFP offers a monthly cash grant to 48,500 Syrian refugee children aged 5 to 14+ enrolled in second shift public schools within select governorates. The support aims to cover the monthly costs associated with purchasing food for school meals. UNICEF covers other indirect costs associated with refugee families sending their children to school.

Building on the successes and learnings of the 2012 Nutrition Policy, the new Nutrition Policy of the World Food Programme (WFP) reaffirms the organization’s commitment to addressing malnutrition as a primary channel to reach Zero Hunger. The new policy aims to contribute to the elimination of all forms of malnutrition—including overweight/obesity—and confirms addressing nutrition in emergencies as a central priority.  

As climate, socio-political and economic dynamics continue to place stress on food and health systems, and as alarming levels of malnutrition persist, new ways of improving nutrition are also required. The policy therefore puts forward an integrated approach to nutrition that simultaneously considers issues of availability, access, demand and consumption of nutritious foods – with a goal of adequate and healthy diets for vulnerable groups of all ages.  

With its strong operational and technical skills, WFP will use its broad range of nutrition experience in various contexts, both to support direct implementation and to provide governments with technical assistance in developing and sustaining nationally-owned nutrition solutions. To the furthest extent possible, WFP’s interventions will reinforce and align to national nutrition plans.  

As women often bear the primary responsibility for feeding their families, gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential to eliminating malnutrition.

Tanzania is hosting 314,797 refugees from Burundi the Democratic Republic of Congo in the camps in North West Tanzania. Over 57 percent of the refugee population are children below 18 years and almost three quarters of the entire population are children and women1 . More than 5000 children are unaccompanied and separated. Protection concerns such as sexual and gender-based violence are significant.  

Refugees in Tanzania are hosted in three camps (Nyarugusu, Mtendeli and Nduta), all of which are overcrowded and there is an inadequate number of schools, a shortage of water, and health and nutrition facilities are overstretched. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity, accounting for 30 per cent of all Out-Patient Department (OPD) attendances.  

There were no new arrivals from Burundi reported in October but since the last week of November, there were reports of new daily arrivals from Burundi in Kasange border in Ngara. During this period, a total of 1,893 asylum seekers (640 Burundians and 1253 Congolese) were received into Tanzania and are hosted in the transit center in Manyovu pending government screening and clearance. The new arrival patterns are linked to population movements across borders as well as variations in border screening measures. Sinnce the commencement of voluntary repatriation in September 2017, 11,055 refugees of the 33,000 registered have voluntarily returned to Burundi following the tripartite agreement between the governments of Tanzania, Burundi and the UNHCR. The new arrivals are coming from different areas of Burundi than those refugees who are returning home to relatively safer areas.

At the beginning of 2017, more than 128 million people needed humanitarian assistance in 33 countries. OCHA appealed for US$22.2 billion – the largest humanitarian appeal ever launched.

The Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), then Stephen O’Brien, warned: “The scale of humanitarian crises today is greater than at any time since the United Nations was founded. Not in living memory have so many people needed our support and solidarity to survive and live in safety and dignity.”

By midyear, this had increased to some 145 million people, which means that as needs rise, so does the amount of money needed to help people. Throughout the year, humanitarian agencies reached tens of millions of people and saved millions of lives.

Vice President U Henry Van Thio, chairman of the Natural Disaster Management Committee (NDMC), made the remark at the NDMC meeting 2/2017 held in the meeting hall of Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement in Nay Pyi Taw yesterday morning.

At the meeting, U Henry Van Thio said NDMC had managed matters relating to natural disaster management starting from May 2016 for nearly two years and had much experience in handling various disasters. With this experience, disaster management works are to be conducted to reduce the damages that can be caused by natural disasters.

“Natural disasters will definitely occur. Lately, the frequency of natural disasters occurring has risen, as well as its destructive power. If the level of disaster management remains the same while the power or strength of natural disaster rises, there’ll be an increase in damages and losses. Therefore, we are striving for better and more effective disaster management as the strength and power of natural disaster increases. Not only individuals, but the whole world is being threatened by national disasters and the world’s countries need to work together as well as individual country to put emphasis on the works of mitigating and reducing (the effect of) natural disasters”, said the Vice President.

At the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai, Japan from 14 to 18 March 2015, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction was set. The four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks of Sendai framework are understanding disaster risk, strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk, investing in disaster reduction for resilience and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
“Our country is following the Sendai Framework and the priorities of Sendai Framework are to be considered in the management stages of national level, state and region level, district level and township level”, remarked the Vice President.

At the national level, the Myanmar Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction (MAPDRR) is drawn according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). As the 23 work projects included in MAPDRR are the responsibility of relevant ministries, States and Regions governments there is a need for the relevant ministries, states and regions governments to take responsibility and work together.

“Annual projects need to be drawn for natural disasters, states and regions-wise. All round the year, we know the time, place and the type of disasters that could occur in our region, and we should be prepared for what to do. We also need to be prepared on response programmes and follow up programmes after the disaster happens. If things like required human, material, financial and technological resources to implement the programs are sourced and ready, arrangements to communicate and cooperate on requirements up and down as well as laterally are made, there’ll be readiness to respond to and face natural disaster in a region and further requirements will be known”, he said.

The NDMC is leading one of the natural disaster preparedness works of building cyclone shelters. A total of 85 will be built — 56 in Ayawaddy Region, 26 in Rakhine State, two in Chin State and one in Shan State. States/Regions Governments members have selected the locations. Each work committee and States/Regions Government members need to follow global agreements and policies set by the nation in conducting natural disaster management works in the region and work sector where each are responsible for and implement programs that are appropriate to their respective region. All need to suggest good ideas and discuss together on requirements for the natural disaster management work to be effective. There is a need for all to work and coordinate together with an aim to prevent and reduce the damages and losses caused by natural disasters to the people said the Vice President.

The NDMC Vice-Chairman Dr. Win Mat Aye, Union Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, said by setting up and conducting effective disaster management work programmes, the ministry is ensuring that the society becomes one that could withstand and respond to natural disasters.

When the evolution of natural disaster management is observed, it was first conducted with a view to managing works programmes after a disaster has occurred. But in later years, based on the experience gained, preparations were toward readiness to face a natural disaster, and a policy of response to natural disaster was made.

Now the preparation works focus on prevention, preparedness, and emergency response works while preparation on recovery works were also being made.

In conducting recovery or reconstruction works, it is conducted not only to make normal recovery or reconstruction works but also include programmes to prepare and withstand against future natural disasters. Furthermore, cooperation with the people in the natural disaster management has progressed from a normal process to a Community-Based Disaster Risk Management process.

Preparations against earthquakes, erosion of river banks and landslides are high capital, high-cost works. But as per the saying, “Invest today for a safer tomorrow,” prevention is better than responding and investing in natural disaster preventive/preparation works not only reduces damages and losses but the cost of reconstruction and redevelopment will also be lower, explained the Union Minister.

NDMC received nearly Ks32 billion in funding, out of which Ks14 billion was used, leaving Ks18 billion left. Funding received in US dollars was about 1 million, out of which 817,711.15 was used and 188,166.19 remains in balance according to the committee.",4591,"Disaster Management"

 “With this program, we are hoping to improve early warning and early action even before a disaster strikes,” Gordon said.

The forum also became a venue for various stakeholders to come together and understand the innovative concept, and how it can contribute to building resilience to disasters especially through the improvement of the anticipatory capacities of governments and communities.

A virtual reality game on how to respond and use the FbF mechanism during disasters was also showcased during the said forum.  

For the PRC, this concept will initially be implemented until July 2020. At early stage, it will be piloted in six provinces, and as soon as knowledge and skills in developing and activating early action protocols (EAP) are established, a wider scale approach will be proposed. This means a more flexible and replicable EAP, wherein PRC can implement early action wherever impending hazards might hit the country.

2391274,"Homegrown African climate model predicts future rains - and risks by Munyaradzi Makoni | Thomson Reuters Foundation  
Friday, 22 December 2017 18:44 GMT

**As African try to adapt to changing conditions, climate information specific to the continent is key, scientists say**

CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Dec 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - One big problem confronts Africa as it tries to predict how its weather patterns will shift in the face of climate change: Almost all the climate models for the continent were created in the United States or Europe.

Now South African climate researcher Francois Engelbrecht has changed that by developing a climate model for Africa, in Africa.

The model aims to ""generate reliable projections of future climate change over Africa,"" said Engelbrecht, the chief researcher for climate studies, modeling and environmental health at South Africa's [Council for Scientific and Industrial Research](https://www.csir.co.za/).

Those projections include figuring out which areas will get more or less rainfall – a key to adapting agriculture successfully – or looking at where African grasslands might give way to thickets as more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere drives the growth of trees.

""We know that climate is changing, risks are changing, including changes in the risk of heatwaves, flooding, drought, tropical cyclones, changes in growing seasons (and) rising temperatures,"" said Rachel James, a visiting climate researcher at the University of Cape Town.

""People everywhere will need to adapt to these changing conditions in the years and decades to come,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""The problem is that we don't know exactly what will happen in any one location. It's challenging to predict which areas might get more rainfall and which might get less.""

MORE DETAIL

The new African-built climate model aims to generate much more detailed and place-specific projections, to give decision makers the information they need to prepare for coming changes.

It responds, in part, to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noting in 2014 that Africa was the only region of the world in which climate forecasts had not improved in recent years.

Developed in collaboration with Australia, the model will look at things such as how El Nino patterns are likely to affect Africa in the future and how African monsoons may shift, Engelbrecht said.

Africa has a lot of expertise on its ecosystems, regional oceans, and climate, but this knowledge has not been built into models up to now, he said.

Models developed by northern hemisphere countries have tended to focus more on areas of northern interest, such as the Arctic, where sea ice is fast disappearing, he said.

And global models that include Africa generally are not specific enough to be helpful on the ground in a particular country or region, said Neville Sweijd, head of the South Africa-based [Alliance for Collaboration on Climate and Earth Systems Science](https://www.access.ac.za/).

""All models are not complete representations of reality and have to be tested for sensitivity to various features and phenomena,"" he said, including the direction of winds.

James noted that ""climates in Africa are particularly challenging to model"" because of the influence of local events such as key thunderstorms, ""which occur on finer scales than the models can resolve,"" she said.

A ‘GAME CHANGER'

Jean-Pierre Roux, who manages the [Future Climate for Africa](http://www.futureclimateafrica.org/) project, an effort, backed by UK aid, to improve climate information and resilience on the continent, said he worries that weak climate information and weather information services that do not meet the needs of vulnerable communities could hurt millions in Africa.

Having African scientists involved in climate information efforts is important as African researchers naturally have more expertise on local and regional weather and climate in many cases, he said.

Also, ""it gives a better chance for African priorities to shape the research agenda and leaves behind a legacy in terms of improved African capacity to conduct research,"" he said.

African climate scientists say they are also worried that the continent does not yet have enough climate scientists to collaborate with other experts globally on models and other work.

""A lot of model application work is being done in Africa, but not by Africans or at African institutions. That disempowers African intellectual development in this field,"" Sweijd told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Engelbrecht sees the development of his model as a chance to build skills in everything from climate science to high-performance computing.

""It is a game changer in enhancing our human capacity in the climate and earth sciences,"" he said.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) signed a joint work plan on Monday. Chairman NDMA, Lt. Gen Omar Mahmood Hayat and the Acting Representative of UNICEF, Cris Munduate signed the document.

This work plan is in line with its agenda to implement a Child-Centered Disaster Risk Reduction approach in preparing and responding to disasters, as well as early recovery.

Since 2015, NDMA-UNICEF partnership has aimed to enhance NDMA’s capacity and delivery of services to minimize risks for children and ensure their well-being and protection in disaster preparedness, response and recovery. Several national level policy documents have been developed and implemented under the partnership. One of the key achievements was the formulation of the Pakistan School Safety Framework and its pilot in all provinces and regions of Pakistan, including ICT, AJK and GB.

The current multi-year work plan of 2017-18 continues to focus on the following priority areas: Child-centered disaster risk reduction through child-inclusive risk assessment, school safety and education in emergencies to ensure sustainability of education in all times, children’s participation through advocacy and communication, knowledge management, capacity building and institutional strengthening for child inclusive climate change adaptation (CCA), capacity building and engagement of relevant stakeholders for disaster preparedness, mitigation and prevention and Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in schools

Chairman NDMA, while speaking on the occasion, said that 2018-19 work plan will serve as another milestone in NDMA’s efforts to ensure that children are protected and prepared for emergencies and their voices are included in decision-making process & policy formulation at all levels of disaster management. 

Ms. Cris Munduate said that collaborative efforts of both organizations led to outstanding achievements in the last years. UNICEF advocates that the survival, protection and development of children are universal development imperatives, that are integral to human progress; and in this vein she looks forward to supporting NDMA to further the rights of children in all phases of disasters.",4591,"Disaster Management"

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)).

**The disaster and the Red Cross Red Crescent response to date**  

- 2016/2017: The African continent faces an unprecedented food crisis. Below-average rainfall due to El Nino and La Nina leads to poor crop harvests and limited availability of water. Conflict and violence further reduces the coping capacities of affected populations.  

- February 2017: The United Nations formally declares famine in parts of South Sudan, and reports severe food insecurity in Nigeria and Somalia.  

- April 2017: IFRC launches the Emergency Appeal for Regional Coordination of the Food Crisis in Africa to scale up and support actions in the most affected countries.  

- December 2017: IFRC issues this revised regional Emergency Appeal with an updated strategy, based on a continuous analysis of the evolving emergency and humanitarian needs in the African continent.

2389319,"Assessment of the economic impact of investment in disaster risk reduction and prevention: The case of Tabasco This study assesses the role of the investments made in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and prevention in the actual reduction of the impact of floods in the state of Tabasco between 2007 and 2010. Based on a previous study conducted within the framework of the Technical Assistance Agreement between the Mexican Government and the World Bank, it was found that the intense rainfall events occurring in Tabasco in 2007 and 2010 were similar in terms of their hydrometeorological characteristics (rainfall) and spatial distribution (rainfall fields). When analyzing the accumulated rainfall recorded for both events, it was found that the magnitude of the 2010 floods was greater than that of the 2007 floods.

However, damages and losses estimations recorded by the National Center for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) show an 80 percent reduction in 2010, compared to 2007 (World Bank, 2014). The similarity between these two events provides an ideal “natural experiment” scenario to evaluate the benefits of the investments in DRR made between 2008 and 2010.

Motivated by the devastating floods that occurred in October 2007, the Mexican Federal Government, together with the Government of the State of Tabasco, designed the Comprehensive Water Plan of Tabasco (PHIT, Plan Hídrico Integral de Tabasco) and began its implementation. The aim of the PHIT was to come up with a set of solutions that guaranteed the population’s safety, as well as the performance and continuity of economic activities and the balance of ecosystems in the occurrence of floods. The PHIT provides for the implementation of structural measures (physical investments, such as embankments and reinforcements) and non-structural measures (non-engineering measures, such as workshops, trainings, development of early warning systems and drawing of risk maps, among others).

The aim of this analysis is to assess the impact caused by the floods and the investments in DRR on the socioeconomic wellbeing of the population of Tabasco. For that purpose, estimations were made of the impact on the school dropout rate for Basic Education students (primary and secondary levels), and of the effect onthe economic activity of the state (measured through changes in the intensity of nighttime lights [or NTL]). On the one hand, the results show that the fluvial flooding level (GLOFRIS) indeed has a negative effect on the level of school dropout and on the changes in NTL. On the other hand, no robust results were found for the effect of the investments in DRR, even after correctinga possible bias resulting from their location. conclusion, the results obtained in this studyreinforce those found in the previous one (World Bank, 2014): the impact of the 2007 floods was greater than that of the 2010 floods, even though the latter year was characterized by rainfall events of a greater magnitude.",4591,"Disaster Management"

A United Nations team led by the Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien, government officials and HPPP chair [Equity Bank](http://equitybankgroup.com/) visited the remote village of Bandarero in Moyale, Marsabit County on March 4 to assess and [raise awareness of the effects of drought.](http://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-flash-appeal-2017)

Many of the families they met said they had little access to water, their livestock had perished, and their children were struggling to stay in school.

“I am here to say that the international community stands with you, and together we will get through these difficult times. We must act early, together, now,” O’Brien told affected families.

The delegation witnessed firsthand the transfer payment system used to dispense cash to drought-affected communities through the support of Equity Bank in collaboration with the [National Drought Management Authority.](http://www.ndma.go.ke/)

The [Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP)](http://www.hsnp.or.ke/) is active in 4 counties - Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera - and targets 68,000 people.

**Equity Bank supports cash transfers of KSH 234 million to drought-hit Kenyans**

On 12 March 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta underscored the importance of public-private partnerships in the mitigation of the impacts of drought on communities living in arid and semi arid areas in northern Kenya.

Presiding over the announcement that Equity Bank would disburse KSH 234 million to vulnerable households on behalf of the Government of Kenya, President Kenyatta noted that cash transfers offer recipients choices. “This will improve living standards for communities living in the arid and semi-arid lands,” he said.

The British High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey lauded Equity Bank’s role in identifying and making payments to beneficiaries through the use of biometric technology. “Instead of donors deciding what is good for people, people are deciding what is good for themselves, whether they want to add on to their livestock numbers or start a small business to sustain their families. This is improving inclusion across Turkana,” he said.

The Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) is a cash transfer programme designed for the extremely poor in the counties of Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera. It is managed by the National Drought Management Authority under the Ministry of Devolution and Planning. The programme provides regular and emergency cash transfers to communities severely affected by drought. It is funded by the Government of Kenya, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and Australian Aid.

Equity Bank disburses cash transfers to vulnerable families in remote areas. The Bank has engaged GPRS and VSAT technologies to ensure the cash is distributed. HSNP's Equity Bank payment system has proven to be effective, efficient and transparent.

Thuraya: Communicating for credible elections & effective water management


From restoring critical communications during and after natural disasters to coordinating emergency response, satellite technology often serves as the backbone to successful relief and support operations. Relief agencies are increasingly reliant on mobile satellite services (MSS) for their robustness and wide coverage to facilitate a timely and efficient humanitarian response.

**Communicating for credible elections**

Thuraya SatSleeve + and XT-PRO handsets are used to share and monitor fair election results over satellite communications. In East Africa, Thuraya is part of the HPPP’s Election Preparedness/ Contingency Working Group.

During Kenya's 2016 by-elections, Thuraya was contacted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the regulatory agency responsible for conducting and supervising referenda and elections. They needed to achieve full and immediate transmission of results, because a delay in the confirmation of election results and declaration of winners raises concerns over the credibility of the electoral process. Four by-elections were being held in county assembly wards that had limited or no terrestrial coverage.

A joint team from Thuraya and Airtel Africa created a 14-day support programme. IEBC election officers participated in training and a results simulation exercise. Thuraya also provided technical support on election day.

The results were comprehensive: Thuraya was able to confirm 100% transmission results from remote county assembly wards using Thuraya handsets, enhancing the credibility of the electoral process.

Monitoring groundwater for effective drought response
To manage water scarcity in communities affected by drought, Thuraya works through various system integrators, using robust and secure M2M two-way communication terminals and services.

The Thuraya M2M FT-2225 terminal connects to water sensors that send data updates in real time to water management platforms over Thuraya’s  satellites. This helps experts collect and analyze data with the goal of monitoring and controlling ground water levels for effective resource management in regions such as Africa and the Middle East.",4591,"Disaster Management"

**NEW DELHI, THURSDAY:** A State-level mock exercise on earthquake was conducted by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in Haryana on Thursday for assessing the preparedness and response mechanism of the State Government in a disaster situation. The exercise was conducted in collaboration with the Haryana State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA).

The exercise simulated an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter Scale with its epicentre at West of Gurugram along the Jaipur Ridge and the Sohna Fault line. 

The simulation exercise was conducted simultaneously at 122 select locations, including hospitals, shopping malls, schools, high-rise residential buildings and major hazardous units, spread across all 22 districts to assess and improve the administration’s capacity in mobilising resources and reaching out to the affected communities swiftly.

**The day in action**

NDMA expert, who led the exercise, briefed about the proceedings of the day. The exercise started with a siren indicating the occurrence of tremors. Everybody ducked under the tables while covering their heads. Once the tremors stopped, evacuation drills were conducted. Soon afterwards, the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) was activated. 

Simultaneously, EOCs at the districts also got activated, assessed the damage, formed rescue teams under Incident Commanders and dispatched them to the respective locations. Rescue drills were conducted in coordination with various agencies, such as Traffic control, Fire Fighting department, Ambulances, Police and Civil Defense. 

People buried under the rubble were rescued and sent to hospitals after administrating preliminary first aid.

After the drill a post-exercise analysis was carried out by NDMA, in which all concerned officials took part. Independent observers from Army shared their feedback and suggested ways to further streamline response mechanisms.

**Preparatory meetings**

This exercise began with a orientation conference on December 6 and was followed by  a coordination Conference on December 19 and a tabletop exercise on December 20 done through videoconferencing with all districts from the State Capital. These preparatory meetings were conducted to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise.

Haryana falls in the seismic zone IV, III, & II. Moreover, tremors have been felt in the State whenever there is an earthquake in the Himalayan foothills due to its proximity to the hill States. Moreover, the State has witnessed rapid industrial-residential urbanisation in the recent past. An earthquake can cause major damage in terms of lives and infrastructure.

2388179,"BVI launches flood-resilient smart communities project Three flood-prone communities in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) will soon benefit from a project that will help them build resilience to that particular climate change impact.

The Establishing Flood-Resilient SMART Communities through Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) Partnerships project will target the communities of Sea Cow’s Bay and East End/Long Look on Tortola, and Great Harbour on the sister island of Jost Van Dyke.

The project is being funded through the Community Disaster Risk Reduction Fund (CDRRF), which is managed by the Caribbean Development Bank. It is a collaborative effort among the Government of the British Virgin Islands through the Department of Disaster Management (DDM), and several non-profit organisations, including the Adventist Development Relief Agency, Rotary Family of BVI, BVI Red Cross and the Jost Van Dyke Preservation Society. CDRRF funded the project to the tune of $649,500.

“The devastation experienced in the Caribbean during the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season is a reminder that tackling the impacts of climate change in one of the world’s most disaster-prone regions must be a matter of urgency,” said Claudia James, Project Manager, CDRRF, CDB. “The Bank remains committed to helping our Borrowing Member Countries build greater resilience to these hazards which continue to threaten the Region’s social and economic development.”

Work to be completed under the project will include retrofitting the Ebenezer Thomas Primary School and Valarie O Thomas Community Centre, installation of sirens, and the procurement and installation of emergency signs and sedimentation traps for water courses.

Director of the DDM, Ms. Sharleen DaBreo underscored the project’s importance in helping the BVI lessen its vulnerability to climate change impacts.

“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has noted that in recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans,” DaBreo said.

Like other Caribbean islands, the BVI is highly susceptible to the devastating impact of natural disasters because of the proximity of communities to coastlines and changes to natural topography.

“We have already witnessed firsthand the catastrophic impact of intensifying weather systems that could be attributed to the warming global climate. The August floods we experienced also illustrate the devastating impact of intense periods of rainfall on vulnerable communities,” she said. “The Flood-Resilient SMART Communities project is therefore quite timely for the BVI and we are keen to see the results.”

The project is intended to create a safer, healthier and greener environment that allows the residents in the target communities and other users to live and function in a way that enhances their overall quality of life.

It is scheduled to be completed over the next two years.

CDRRF was established by CDB and is supported by the Government of Canada and the European Union. The Fund finances community-based disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation initiatives at the local level across eligible borrowing member countries of the CDB.

Other key issues cited included the proper management of mineral resources in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries so that they benefit ACP sustainable development, peaceful political transition in Zimbabwe, and the outright condemnation of slavery practices in Mauritania and Libya.
""It is our duty to make every effort to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters for affected populations"", said Michèle Rivasi, Co-President of the ACP-EU JPA.

The 34th session of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) bringing together parliamentarians from the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and European Union (EU) countries was officially opened on Monday in Port-au-Prince by Haiti's President Jovenel Moïse, accompanied by Youri Latortue, President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Haiti. The co-chairs commended the Haitian authorities for their welcome in spite of the terrible hardships they had endured.
 
During the ceremony, Ibrahim Rassin Bundu (Sierra Leone), the JPA Co-Chair for the ACP, stressed how ""the Assembly and its members have been a positive force in the quest for sustainable development and poverty eradication"".  He reiterated the importance of the parliamentary dimension of the ACP-EU partnership to ""give a democratic nature to cooperation"". “The post-Cotonou Agreement must therefore continue to have a strong parliamentary dimension"", he added.

Michèle Rivasi, acting co-president of the JPA for the European Union, stressed the increase over the last decade of ""catastrophic events that could destroy years of development and investment"". She has requested that people's resilience capacities be promoted. ""Security, poverty reduction and prosperity depend on the integration of climate change adaptation strategies in all sectors,"" she added. This urgent matter will be discussed on Monday and concluded with a resolution on Wednesday.
 
Valuing mineral resources for sustainable development
 
The Assembly will also debate this week on the link between ownership, exploitation and development of ACP mineral resources and sustainable development. These vast resources can be transformative for societies if local communities benefit from them, said the ACP-EU Co-President.
 
Other key topics of the 34th session
 
This session will also discuss the critical situation of migrants in Libya. There will also be an urgent debate and resolution on the risks of a deterioration of the internal situation in Mauritania. The parties also strongly wish to address the issue of slavery.

2385744,"EU funding for disaster preparedness in the Caribbean In the aftermath of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which wreaked havoc across the Caribbean in September 2017, the European Commission has mobilised an additional €3.3 million to support preparedness initiatives that will help countries in the region to avert future crises.

""*It was just a few months ago when the Caribbean islands had to endure the devastating effects of catastrophic hurricanes. These disasters highlighted the vulnerability of these countries to natural hazards, which are only getting worse and more frequent as a consequence of climate change. The EU is committed to invest in emergency preparedness and response to minimise the impact of future disasters*,"" said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides.

The Caribbean region is surrounded by several tectonic plates meaning that it is particularly vulnerable to severe, recurring natural hazards. The new funding will support preparedness initiatives in the region and will be used to enhance local water and sanitation response capacities in Haiti to help local teams provide immediate, high-quality response in emergencies, including in case of epidemics.

The €3.3 million comes on top of the €61 million for disaster preparedness the EU has allocated to the Caribbean since 1994.

**Background**
   
The EU quickly intervened after hurricanes Irma and Maria (both category 5, maximum strength hurricanes) devastated Dominica, Cuba, Antigua and Barbuda, and severely affected Turks & Caicos, St Kitts & Nevis, Sint Maarten and Saint Martin, the British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

Under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, EU Member States provided logistical support for humanitarian relief, civil protection expertise and in-kind assistance to affected Caribbean countries and territories. Additionally, the European Commission allocated €2.9 million in humanitarian relief to provide temporary shelters, safe drinking water, food assistance and health and sanitation services to the most affected islands.

These events took place after an extreme drought, a consequence of the El Niño weather phenomenon, which has affected over 6 million people in Caribbean countries since 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, Commission-funded response interventions worth €14 million in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba helped to mitigate the impact of the drought on people’s livelihoods, food security, and health.",4591,"Disaster Management"
2385384,"WFP Launches First Emergency Logistics Simulation Training **ADDIS ABABA – On 15 December, WFP kicked off the organization’s first ever Emergency Logistics Simulation Training to be held in Ethiopia.**

From 15 to 18 December, a total of 45 participants from Government agencies, including the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) and the Oromia Disaster Prevention Preparedness Committee (ODPPC), as well as United Nations agencies, NGOs and private sector companies will participate in the training, covering several simulation exercises, held in Adama, Oromia Region.

As a world leader in humanitarian logistics, WFP’s objective is to help prepare skilled staff from various agencies and organizations to make rapid, informed decisions at the onset of an emergency or natural disaster. Participants will improve their ability to provide immediate operational logistics response capacity, identify challenges and implement quick, effective solutions to deliver life-saving food assistance.

“The Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia strongly believes that natural disasters can be effectively addressed if targeted interventions are practiced through preparedness measures,” said Tadesse Bekele Fanta, Senior Disaster Risk Management Adviser, NDRMC.

“We continue to engage in a strong partnership with WFP, towards the full implementation of the Government’s Disaster Response Management policy, which focuses on risk reduction activities and emergency preparedness. Towards this end, timely response is crucial in minimizing risks and strengthening supply chain capacity.”

During the training, WFP will organize real-life simulations that teach participants about possible challenges they can face in a logistics response – by analyzing key components such as transport and storage, and how to solve such challenges.

“Our aim is to provide disaster management participants with the opportunity to review their level of preparedness, practice their response, and improve their decision-making process,” said Peter Schaller, Deputy Country Director for WFP Ethiopia. “Together with the NDRMC, we will work together to strengthen national systems for rapid, cost-efficient and effective emergency response – and ultimately, to save lives when disaster strikes.”

2385194,"Occupied Palestinian Territory: Humanitarian Needs Overview 2018, November 2017 OVERVIEW 

The humanitarian context of the oPt is unique amongst today’s crises and remains directly tied to the impact of the occupation, which marked its 50th year in June 2017. A protracted protection crisis continues. At least 1.9 million Palestinians experience, or are at risk of, conflict and violence, displacement and denial of access to livelihoods, among other threats. The most vulnerable Palestinians are currently denied or restricted in their access to essential services such as water and health care. A recurrent cycle of shocks, natural and manmade, has eroded the resilience of vulnerable households to cope with the prolonged nature of the humanitarian crisis. 

These dynamics are significantly magnified in the Gaza context by the protracted blockade, imposed by Israel citing security concerns after the takeover of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, three major escalations of hostilities in less than ten years and the intensification of the internal divide between the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) and the de facto Hamas authorities during the course of 2017. Combined, these factors have devastated public infrastructure, disrupted the delivery of basic services and undermined already vulnerable living conditions. Across the oPt, one in two Palestinians, or roughly two and a half million people, will need some form of humanitarian assistance in 2018.

GAZA STRIP 

The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip deteriorated markedly in 2017 due to an escalation in the internal Palestinian political divide, following the decision in March by the de facto Hamas leadership to establish a parallel structure to run local ministries in Gaza.In response, the PA reduced payments for electricity, the allowances of public employees, and payments for the referral of patients for treatment outside Gaza. Longer power outages have negatively impacted basic health and water and sanitation services and limited the ability of farmers to irrigate their lands, further undermining food security and livelihoods. Following Egyptian mediation, the two sides reached an agreement in October 2017, which envisages the PA resuming control of the Gaza crossings, as a necessary first step towards alleviating the humanitarian situation and achieving the goal of Palestinian unity under a single, democratic and legitimate national authority. The measures put in place in Gaza in 2017 by the PA had yet to be reversed at the time of preparation of the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO).

The magnitude of the challenges facing Gaza is underlined in a recent United Nations report projecting the situation of Gaza in the year 2020. The study revisited key indicators first published in 2012, and found “that most of the projections for 2020 have in fact deteriorated even further and faster than anticipated” with the population increasing and the economy and basic infrastructure and services deteriorating, and “simply unable to keep up with demand.” Real GDP growth in Gaza has slowed to only 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, while the unemployment rate for the second quarter rose to 44 per cent. Unemployment among those aged between 15 and 29 has reached a “staggering” 62 per cent. According to The Economist, “In real terms, Gazans are about 25 per cent poorer today than they were at the time of the Oslo Accords.” The standard of living in Gaza, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person of $1,700 a year in 2015, is comparable to Congo-Brazzaville; the West Bank figure, $3,700 a year, is similar to Egypt; while Israel, $35,000 a year, is “much the same as France”.

The August 2014 ceasefire continues to hold, with a relatively low number of Palestinian fatalities (17) and injuries (221) by Israeli forces as of November 2017, and no further conflict-related displacement recorded.  Approximately 23,500 people still remain displaced from the 2014 conflict, as of November 2017. The Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has played a key role in facilitating increased imports of construction materials; however, it has been less successful in facilitating the import of dual use materials beyond cement and re-bar, also critical for public works projects.  
As of November 2017, 5,755 out of the 11,000 totally destroyed housing units have been reconstructed and work on an additional 818 is underway. Insufficient funding is the primary obstacle to completing the remaining residential reconstruction projects.

Most of the two million Palestinians in Gaza remain unable to access the remainder of the oPt and the outside world, with only a minority eligible for exit permits via Israel, primarily patients, business people and the staff of international organizations. Although the number of Palestinian exits increased after the 2014 hostilities, figures have declined significantly again since the second half of 2016, with the figure for November 2017 some 47 per cent below the 2016 average. While there has been a gradual increase in the absolute number of medical patients allowed through the Israeli-controlled Erez crossing, the approval rate has also been declining, at 55 per cent in October compared to 93 per cent in 2012. While the number of approved permit applications for United Nations national staff to leave Gaza increased by 19.7 per cent from the second half of 2016 to the first half of 2017, the Israeli authorities have significantly increased the time necessary for processing permits, from 26 to 55 working days, impeding humanitarian operations.  
Movement constraints have been compounded by the protracted closure of the Rafah terminal, which has only partially opened for 29 days in 2017, allowing 1,222 patients to exit for medical treatment.

**Protection** 

Although the 2014 ceasefire has held, the ongoing restrictions on the movement of people and goods and the threat of a new round of hostilities are major protection concerns for Palestinians in Gaza. These concerns are exacerbated by the rising hopelessness and deterioration in the humanitarian situation, as well as by the shooting of rockets at Israel and the digging of attack tunnels, among other factors. The risk of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) remains and high levels of psychosocial distress are reported across the population, particularly among children, leaving them with a deep sense of insecurity, fear and hopelessness. The protracted humanitarian crisis has also exacerbated genderbased-violence (GBV) in all its forms, including sexual violence, domestic violence and child marriage. The Protection Cluster continues to identify accountability for violations during the Gaza hostilities in 2014, by all sides, and for violations during the daily enforcement of restrictions in the Access Restricted Areas (ARAs) as an urgent priority. 

**Displacement**

No new displacement was recorded in Gaza in 2017. The GRM has provided access to vital construction materials, but as of November 2017 funding is lacking for the reconstruction of about 3,800 destroyed and over 56,500 damaged housing units from the 2014 round of hostilities. Displacement continues for 23,500 people who are primarily reliant on temporary shelter cash assistance (TSCA) to rent accommodation until their homes are reconstructed or rehabilitated. TSCA been disrupted due to significant funding shortages with anecdotal evidence suggesting that this has resulted in debt accumulation and the adoption of negative coping mechanisms such as withdrawing children from school or engaging children in income generation.10 Some 4,500 families who have not yet received assistance to repair conflict-related damages are in urgent need of support due to continued exposure to the elements, high vulnerability and lack of resources. In addition, 8,100 families are at risk of exposure due to inadequate protection against the natural elements.  

**Access to essential services** 

The provision of basic services in Gaza remains a key humanitarian concern. Increasing electricity cuts are undermining basic services already depleted by the blockade, recurrent hostilities and restrictions on the import of goods considered “dual use”. Surgeries are being delayed, some diagnostic services are being put on hold, and there has been a disruption in the delivery of primary healthcare (PHC) and secondary healthcare (SHC) services by the Ministry of Health (MoH). Health provision is also impeded by delays in the shipment of essential drugs and disposables from the PA Ministry of Health, which has also recently been delaying or suspending payment for the referral of patients for medical treatment outside Gaza. The number of permit applications denied or delayed by Israel to access health care outside Gaza has also been on the increase, reaching 45 per cent of applications in October 2017.  

The blockade and escalations in hostilities have also resulted in repeated damage and the destruction of infrastructure, the deaths of students and teachers and psychosocial stress among children and teachers. Increasing electricity shortages are affecting children’s right and ability to access education at school and at home, restricting study time and their ability to concentrate.  
Some 70 per cent of UNRWA schools and over 63 per cent of Ministry of Education schools operate on a double or triple shift system which has reduced instruction time to about four hours a day, and limited the time available to reinforce learning, support slow learners, and offer remedial education and extracurricular activities. Psychosocial services are also struggling to cope with the nearly 300,000 children who require some form of mental health support or psychosocial intervention. 
 
Water and sanitation (WASH) infrastructure and delivery has also been impacted by recurrent conflict, the over exploitation of resources and restrictions on the import of “dual use” WASH items. Over 95 per cent of the water extracted from the aquifer is unfit for human consumption, with the result that 90 per cent of people in Gaza rely on purchasing desalinated water from private trucking, posing a heavy financial burden on already impoverished families and health risks due to widespread contamination of that source. Increased electricity cuts have further reduced the drinkable/ piped water supply and the operation of approximately 130 critical water and sanitation facilities. This has resulted in the discharge of untreated sewage into the sea, contaminating the majority of Gaza beaches, and heightening the risk of the overflow of raw sewage onto the streets.  

**Erosion of resilience** 

Recurrent hostilities, the blockade, degraded infrastructure and cuts in the allowances of public employees have impaired economic growth and perpetuated high levels of poverty, unemployment, (particularly among youth), and food insecurity. About 80 per cent of people in Gaza receive food assistance and other forms of social transfers which enable scarce cash resources to be spent on other essentials, preventing a further deterioration of food security and livelihood status, and reducing the impact of negative coping mechanisms. Increased power shortages have further undermined economic activity, particularly in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, with some 30,000 out of 80,000 dunums planted with seasonal vegetable crops at risk due to irregular irrigation, and dairy cattle farmers and poultry breeders also facing significant losses. The condition of the aquifer, Gaza’s sole source of natural water, is of particular concern as it will be “unusable” by end-2017, with damage “irreversible” by 2020, “unless immediate remedial action is taken.”",4591,"Disaster Management"

2384854,"Greece: Population Movement - Emergency Appeal (MDRGR001) Operations update n° 7 **Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:**

This operation update is to report on progress made from 1 May to 25 October 2017 against the programmes outlined in the revised [Emergency Plan of Action](https://reliefweb.int/node/1095836/). During the reporting period, some programmes did not materialize for various reasons, while some additional interventions have been supported by the Appeal due to the needs identified. The move to transit from emergency relief to greater integration-focused and longer term (and more sustainable) programmes continues to be reinforced with the development of an Operational Plan for Greece (pending approval) in 2018. The Emergency Appeal will run alongside the Operational Plan for the first half of 2018, after which the EA will be closed.

**A. Situation analysis**

**Description of the disaster**

Two years after the beginning of the migration crisis (in 2015), around 45,614 migrants remain on the mainland (32,158) and islands (13,456) of Greece, according to figures as of end of September by UNHCR.3 Compared to previous years, arrivals to Greece in 2017 have significantly decreased.  
However, during August and September 2017 there was a significant increase which created a critical situation of overcrowding in the Reception and Identification Centres (RICs) of the islands.  
In October 2017, UNHCR and other organisations in Greece have urged action on the islands to ease overcrowding, improve shelter, and stock and distribute appropriate and sufficient aid items. Nearly 5,000 refugees, mostly Syrian or Iraqi families, crossed from Turkey in September - a quarter of all arrivals this year.4 While that is a fraction of the nearly 1 million who arrived in 2015 - due to a European Union statement with Turkey - four of the five island camps are hosting two or three times as many people as they were designed for. In the RIC of Lesvos, Moria, for example, 1,500 people are currently living in makeshift tents with no insulation which raises concerns over the approaching of winter.5 The ‘Financial Plan 2017’ agreed between Greek and EU representatives (DG Home and DG ECHO) in February 2017 established that, with the exception of ECHO’s funding for alternative accommodation spaces and cash transfer programmes, provision of services in the island’s RICs is a responsibility of the Greek government with the EU financial support to the national programmes. 

While conditions on the camps in the mainland has improved as compared to the previous year, there continues to be a substantial number of protection challenges in Greece. Some, for example those linked to the lack of security and registration in camps, are longstanding and not able to be resolved in the absence of meaningful action by the Greek government. Other challenges are also emerging as populations transition into urban environments. Populations in camps, particularly in the islands, continue to experience overcrowding and inadequate standards of accommodation, ranging from tents to caravans shared with strangers and without adequate locks and other security mechanisms. There are frequent reports of both actual and apprehended violence from camp based populations, with rumours fuelling more fear, concern and community tensions. There is in general a lack of security in camps, and at many sites entry and egress are not controlled. Camp residents find that people come into the camp from outside completely unimpeded, often for the purpose of drugs, crime, sex work, and other problematic activities. People within camps, particularly women and children, are very afraid to move around at night as they do not know who is in the camp. There has been no MoMP registration in camps for many months (since May). People have continued to arrive in camps, resulting in large unregistered populations. These people cannot have access to cash, so are reliant on savings, generosity from friends and neighbours, or other sources of income in order to meet their basic needs.  
The lack of registration also means that people cannot be allocated a caravan officially, which is fuelling an exploitative black market whereby community leaders allocate caravans in return for payments amounting to hundreds of euros. 

From January until September (included) 2017 a total of 42,495 applications for international protection have been submitted to the Greek Asylum Service. The main countries of origins of asylum-seekers who have submitted an asylum application in 2017 were from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.6 In September 2017 the government stated that 10 camps out of the 20 will be closed by the end of the year and that the government will be responsible for managing healthcare related services in the camps from January 2018, further decreasing the role of NGOs in this context. Additionally, the aim is to move all migrants into rental accommodation schemes (by the end of 2018) instead of retaining the ‘camp based accommodation’ strategy. The UNHCR and its partners presented in July 2017 the newly launched Emergency Support to Integration & Accommodation programme (ESTIA)7 of the EU Humanitarian Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Directorate General, which aims to assist refugees and their families rent urban accommodation and provide them with cash assistance.  

Therefore, the fact that many people are now (or soon to be accommodated) in urban areas and that the EU Relocation programme ended in September 2017, leaves most people in Greece bound to live in the country, thus the need of integration services throughout the country is crucial. Facilitation of migrants and refugees to access public hospitals or public services to receive health insurance and tax numbers, language courses and access to the local job market are only some of the most important integration actions that need to be further explored and acted on.  

Therefore, while the urgency of meeting the basic needs for the new asylum seekers and migrants will continue, the more substantial question will be how to ensure that both basic needs of recognized refugees, as well as their inclusion and integration can be met by the services provided by, or through, the Greek government in the long run. This need will be most pronounced in the urban areas, which now host the majority of the migrant and refugee population.  

In general terms, the Emergency Appeal will focus on meeting the basic needs of the migrants, while the Annual Plan will emphasize the longer-term needs of migrants, as well as vulnerable Greeks, and where these two populations meet.

2384159,"Taking Matters into Own Hands: Disaster Risk Insurance in the Pacific An abundance of scientific climate research and recent events clearly indicate that many Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are vulnerable to natural hazards. The economic impacts of cyclones, droughts and tsunamis show why governments need disaster risk finance and insurance strategies to protect against fiscal shocks.

Take Palau as an example. Typhoon Marie struck in 1976 causing more than $4 million in damages, but then the Island remained unscathed for more than a generation.  That all changed in November 2012, when Typhoon Bopha hit, causing an estimated $15-20 million in damages. A year later Typhoon Haiyan landed on Palau’s northern island of Kayangel, wiping out housing and crop yields. And in 2016, a severe drought forced the government to reduce public water access to an hour a day in most parts of Koror, where about 65% of the country’s population resides.

Fortunately today, technical and financial solutions are now available to help PIC governments to reduce the fiscal impact and underlying climate and disaster risks.

At the 2015 [Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM),](http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/economic-governance/forum-economic-ministers-meeting-femm/) Pacific Islands’ ministers of finance agreed to form a regional risk pool that gives governments access to affordable, catastrophic insurance to cover against climate and seismic hazards. Last year, the region’s first catastrophe insurance platform was established – [the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC)](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/pacific-catastrophe-risk-insurance-company-increases-reinsurance-19/) – and is owned and directed by its subscribing members: Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu.

PCRIC policies are designed to payout within 10 days of a triggered event. Payouts provide an immediate injection of money for emergency costs and cushion the fiscal shock to the national budget. To date, two payouts to Tonga and Vanuatu paid out more than $3.2 million. The $1.9 million paid to Vanuatu totaled eight times the emergency budget provision.

Currently, PCRIC members and other countries are looking to expand insurance cover for additional climate hazards like drought and excess rainfall.

Parallel efforts by governments are enhancing financial and economic planning for climate risks. The public and private sectors are partnering to improve building codes. For example, Fiji is revising its housing codes as a direct response to Tropical Cyclone Winston that affected 60% of its population.

Local databases such as the [Pacific Catastrophe Risk Information System (PacRIS](https://www.gfdrr.org/en/pacific-catastrophe-risk-assessment-and-financing-initiative-phase-3-pcrafi-3)) and similar historical weather databases forecast financial losses and damages to assets. The information is available, as is the opportunity for governments to take financial decisions. According to a regional study, annual direct losses caused by natural disasters in the Pacific are more than $250 million annually, not to mention the huge toll on human life.

The Pacific island region entered a new tropical cyclone season last month. The start of the season serves as a reminder that governments need to take on financial solutions, like PCRIC, to protect their people and economies against climate and disaster risk

2383964,"Resilience or resignation: facing droughts and floods in rural, poor Bolivia **Introduction**

**‘Resilience: Ability of the life system and its components to anticipate, absorb, adapt or recover from the effects of an adverse event in a timely and efficient manner, including by ensuring the conservation, restoration or improvement of its essential basic structures and functions.’** 

**Supreme Decree regulating the Law No. 602 of Risk Management, Bolivia**

Yolanda is a 46 year old woman who lives with her husband and her six children. After the floods, she left her community to live in a rental unit nearby. Since then, she has been struggling because she no longer has a house or a plot of land to work. Day after day, she has to look for work as a day laborer, and her income is insufficient for the sustenance of her family. Before the floods, she used to have a tranquil life; cultivating her own produce and working the land. She had enough food for her children; she also had her own house and fruit trees. She expresses great sorrow regarding the difficult situation her family is in. Her economic needs, her worries and suffering, have made her ill: she now has headaches constantly. She feels the burden of supporting the family. Despite the fact her husband also works, their earnings are never enough to make ends meet. 

**Woman affected by floods**

Pedro is a 71 year old man. He used to live with his wife, but she became ill, and their children took her to the city of Cochabamba. At present, he lives alone; he has eight children, all married. He has been affected by the drought and has lost his potato and corn crops. Now, he is surviving only on some vegetable crops. He is ill, suffering from a hernia and Chagas disease; he no longer has the strength to sow, but still continues to work his field. He is simply awaiting the rain, in the hope that the weather improves. He is resigned to staying in his community until his death because he is most accustomed to living in the countryside, but hopes that his children will come back to their fields to sow. He will go on sowing as long as he can.

**Man affected by droughts**

Bolivia is a country with a vast geographical diversity, from a high plateau (altiplano) that reaches 3,000 meters above sea level to valleys at mid-altitude and tropical plains. This diversity gives Bolivia a wide variety of temperatures and microweathers, which is accompanied by a high risk of adverse weather events. Bolivia has historically been exposed to floods and droughts. Approximately four out of 10 people live in flood-prone plots, and more than 16 percent of the population live in areas at risk of drought. Accompanying this geographic diversity, Bolivia has a large indigenous population, comprising more than 40 different ethnic groups of varying sizes and with diverse livelihoods strategies. Moreover, despite significant progress in the last decade, a large proportion of Bolivia’s population are not able to afford a basic food basket (about 16.8 percent in 2015). The levels of poverty are significantly higher for indigenous and rural populations.

During the last decade, the magnitude of Bolivia’s weather patterns has undergone significant changes; extreme rainfall, floods, landslides, and droughts have been pushing the poorest and most marginalized communities beyond their ability to respond. According to several studies, Bolivia is one of the Andean region countries that most suffers the consequences of weather change (García et al., 2007; Jansen et al., 2009; Winters, 2012). Weather change is already causing the acceleration of glacier melting, increasing the likelihood and intensity of floods. The expected impacts on the Andean countries are serious: unprecedented temperature rise in tropical areas, intensification of the El Niño phenomenon, and droughts in tropical and subtropical areas (Cai et al., 2014).  

There is a considerable amount of literature documenting the consequences of weather shocks on income and poverty. 5 The evidence shows that weather events such as droughts and floods have negative impacts on communities, and cause destruction of infrastructure, loss of savings and assets, etc. The extent of the weather event impacts depends on the ability of families to manage these risks, not only after they occur, but also before they occur by taking measures to prevent or minimize their impact. The recurrence of this type of events also influences risk management; the condition of poverty in itself affects the strategies employed. It is important to note that poverty can amplify weather change impacts and can lead to a vicious circle of chronic poverty. Although causal evidence is more limited in Bolivia, several studies confirm this link between droughts and floods, and poverty (UDAPE, 2014 and 2016).",4591,"Disaster Management"

 The meeting updated members on disease outbreaks in the region. The number of cholera cases in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has exceeded a threshold of 1,000 cases per week since week 32 of 2017. In comparison with other years, the number of this year’s cases is unusually high (29,614 as of 29 September), and the Ministry of Health has declared the epidemic a major health emergency. A cholera epidemic is also underway in Chad, in Salamat and Sila. As of 25 September, 422 suspected cases (including 51 deaths) were reported by both regions, particularly in Sila. The high fatality rate of 12% is attributed to difficulty in accessing or leaving the region during the rainy season.

 A malaria epidemic is ongoing in Cabo Verde, with 267 cases. The country had previously been identified by WHO as a country where malaria could be eliminated by 2020, according to the national plans.

2383694,"Aid localisation as a catalyst for resilience during the post-Matthew response in Haiti *The following article is based on a study on aid localisation during the response to Hurricane Matthew which struck Haiti in October 2016. It draws on a series of interviews carried out in Haiti in May and June 2017. It presents how and why aid localisation is seen as a way of increasing resilience. It also analyses certain limits that were observed.*

Given the trauma and the lessons learned from the response to the 2010 earthquake, and particularly the relentless and recurring nature of the hurricanes that Haitian organisations face and will continue to face, most stakeholders quickly saw aid localisation during the response to Hurricane Matthew as legitimate and necessary. In this precise context, the different stakeholders involved in the response almost unanimously explain that they believe in aid localisation as a way of building the country’s resilience in relation to natural disasters and crisis situations. Three underlying factors of resilience are regularly mentioned when discussing the role and position of national and local actors during the response. These are: crisis preparedness, recovery and the long-term impact of the response.

**Localisation as a vector of crisis preparedness**

**Reinforcing risk and disaster management through the Directorate of Civil Protection**

Haiti’s national risk and disaster management system is more or less in place despite still not having a legal framework. The Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC), the public institution in charge of the operational management of risks and disaster, is not part of any organic law and therefore does not have its own budget, nor does it have genuine leadership status in relation to other public institutions. Its mission is to respond to disasters and also prevent and prepare for risks. It therefore played a central role in the preparations for Matthew, and considerable progress was made compared to the situation during the hurricanes in 2004 and 2008. This improvement is mainly the result of DPC’s reinforced operational capacity due to massive investment on the part of international donors and UN agencies in recent years.

During the 2016 hurricane season, the DPC carried out two simulation exercises involving the national and departmental emergency operations centres. One of these concerned the response to a hurricane in the regions that were hit by Matthew a few weeks later. These emergency operations centres were activated several days before the hurricane, which brought together numerous aid organisations (UN agencies and international NGOs) to prepare and coordinate their operations in collaboration with the DPC, before, during and after the hurricane.

International NGOs also provided the DPC with support, particularly at the commune and local level, in partnership with Haitian civil society organisations. However, though skills at this level were reinforced through training, operational means in “communes” and “sections communales” remained extremely weak. Yet, this local level proved to be essential, notably during the preparation phase. In addition to the warning and evacuation messages sent to the population by radio and text message, the volunteer staff of the civil protection force (and the Haitian Red Cross) covered the regions concerned to communicate security measures and indicate where provisional shelters were located using megaphones. At the “commune” and “section communale” levels, the civil protection committees and emergency operations centres are less formalised and are made up essentially of volunteers. Those who were mobilized during the passage of hurricane Matthew were therefore mostly inhabitants of the affected regions, and were both victims of the hurricane and among the first to provide assistance to their families and neighbours. This situation shows the permeability between public actors, civil society and the population at the local level, and, above all, illustrates that the localisation of the response to Matthew was also boosted by local actors themselves, first among which were the population and community leaders. It shows how fine the line is at the local level between localisation, participatory approaches and community engagement.

 

**Localisation as a way of preparing for future hurricanes**

The importance of preparedness in Haiti in June 2017 was all the more obvious because the country was about to enter a new hurricane season. All the organisations present in Haiti were therefore preoccupied by this preparation and conscious of the need to contribute to it in their operations in response to Matthew. For a certain number of organisations, such as those that had been involved in the 2010 earthquake response, localisation is primarily about recognizing the legitimacy and responsibility of the state as a key actor of the response, despite its limited capacity. Without denying the importance of pre-crisis preparation which aims to give national and local actors control of subsequent responses, localisation goes further because it consists of increasing the role of national and local actors concretely during a response and putting them back at the centre of the response. As such, the localisation of the response to Matthew (though insufficient according to many interviewees) has helped to build the capacity of Haitian actors (including civil society organisations who have been very involved in the response) through practical experience, and has helped to prepare them to cope with future crises. Thus, in this specific context where there are frequent hurricanes, aid localisation cannot be put off on the pretext that local and national actors do not have the necessary capacity or are insufficiently prepared. On the contrary, it is seen as a way of increasing preparation for future crises.",4591,"Disaster Management"

The discussion was intended to generate input for and views of the study from civil society organizations working on risk reduction and adaptation in Indonesia.  
  
The study is being conducted by the [Indonesian Red Cross](http://www.pmi.or.id/) and the IFRC with technical support from the PfR country team.  
  
It includes an examination of newly gathered data, a review of published literature, and interviews with government officials, experts and partner agencies – all current as of November; the final report will be issued early in the new year.  
  
The maximum number of partners were involved from the outset to make the study as comprehensive as possible, and specialists on risk reduction, adaptation and urban planning provided input at an earlier meeting in September.  
  
**‘Dialogue’**  
  
Engagement in the study is expected to enhance the capacity and commitment of individuals and partner organizations to conduct dialogue on its recommendations with the government, organizers said.  
  
“Study of this topic in Indonesia is very limited as things stand, but also very necessary,” said Andi Simarmata, an urban expert from the [University of Indonesia](http://www.ui.ac.id/en/).  
  
“The integration of disaster risk reduction into spatial planning is a relatively rare, but to provide detailed information for strengthening policy this review should be limited to the national level – others may be able to take action at the local level.”  
  
A number of recommendations have already emerged from the study, including improved coordination of institutional regulation and legislation.  
  
“We hope to engage in dialogue with relevant ministries to strengthen risk reduction and adaptation policies recommended by this study,” said Ari Mochammad, an adviser to the USAID-funded Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience Program in Indonesia.  
  
Dialogue with the [Ministry of National Development Planning](https://www.bappenas.go.id/id/) and a number of other ministries and agencies is now planned for early 2018.

The Asia-Pacific series of Conferences on Military Assistance to Disaster Relief Operations (APC-MADRO) that took place over a five-year period (2005-2010), were organised with the aim of developing collaborative Guidelines to assist the planning of foreign military assistance in support of disaster response operations in the Asia-Pacific region. At the end of this process, the Asia-Pacific Regional Guidelines for the Use of Foreign Military Assets in Natural Disaster Response Operations (APC Madro Guidelines) were finalized and endorsed.

Building upon the outcomes of the Asia-Pacific series of Conferences and related Guidelines, a multi-stakeholder Regional Consultative Group (RCG) on Humanitarian Civil-Military Coordination for Asia and the Pacific was formed in 2014 to act as a regional forum that brings together the humanitarian, civilian and military actors involved in disaster response preparedness planning and disaster response in the region. As outlined in the RCG Terms of Reference, the RCG was formed to: a) discuss response preparedness planning, with a focus on coordination of operational planning between civilian and military actors; b) facilitate exchange of information and innovative ideas to enable well-coordinated and needs-based effective disaster response to a broad range of humanitarian emergency operations; c) strengthen linkages with other relevant platforms with an emphasis on the relationship with Regional Organizations and the Global Consultative Group on Humanitarian Civil-Military Coordination. The chairmanship of the RCG is rotated among Member States on an annual basis.

2382224,"ADB to Help Strengthen Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu's Resilience to Disasters MANILA, PHILIPPINES (18 December 2017) — The Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Board of Directors has approved a total of $15 million in financing, comprised of policy-based loans and grants, for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program which will help strengthen Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu’s resilience to disasters.

ADB’s assistance will include loans worth $3.1 million each to Samoa and Tonga. It will also include grants worth $2.9 million each to Samoa and Tonga and $3 million to Tuvalu. All three grants are financed from the Asian Development Fund, ADB’s grant-based development financing vehicle. An ADB-supported $2 million technical assistance grant will help the three countries implement priority resilience building activities and share their experiences.

“This program will facilitate faster early recovery and reconstruction which will significantly reduce the secondary economic and social costs normally caused by delays in reconstruction activities following a disaster event,” said Hanna Uusimaa, Climate Change Specialist from ADB’s Pacific Department.

The program mirrors the ADB-supported Cook Islands Disaster Resilience Program approved in December 2016, which uses disaster contingent financing through innovative use of policy-based financing.

The Pacific Disaster Resilience Program fills a financing gap experienced by many Pacific countries hit hard by disasters. It provides a predictable and quick-disbursing source of financing for early response, recovery, and reconstruction activities, and supports priority actions in disaster risk management in participating countries.

The program supports regional collaboration towards strengthened disaster risk management and disaster risk financing. It also encourages the sharing of experiences between Pacific countries, in close alignment with the work of other development partners, and under the guidance of the region’s own framework for resilient development. It also addresses risks pertaining to disaster events that would normally exhaust annual contingency budgets or emergency funds, but may not be cost effectively covered by insurance.

ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members—48 from the region.

The revision document will be expected by early January 2018.

**A. Situation analysis**

Description of the disaster

Nepal experienced incessant rainfall between 11 and 14 August 2017, resulting in widespread floods across 31 of the country’s 75 districts. The floods have affected a total of 1.7 million people. The number of people who were reported as dead was 149 and recorded injuries were 134 people. 

More than 190,000 houses were fully destroyed or partially damaged, displacing many people and rendering others homeless. People lived in temporary shelters or migrated temporarily. Along with the house, household assets and food grains were damaged by the floods. The affected communities faced shortage of food, water and non-food items. Many suffered infections from contaminated water. Crops were lost in a large area of agricultural land.

The affected people have tried to cope with the situation. Many families evacuated from their homes and moved to community centers. As houses were damaged on a large scale, families faced a pressing need for emergency shelter assistance. Schools were used as temporary shelters. The displaced population and a portion of the affected also needed basic household items, as these were lost to or damaged by the floodwaters.  In many areas, the families also coped with disrupted water supplies, and poor access to sanitation facilities.  

Providing safe drinking water and household toilets were among the most important priorities. As standing crops, seed stock, farm tools were badly affected, households needed immediate support for resuming agriculture.  

The Central Natural Disaster Relief Committee (CNDRC) meeting resolved to conduct a detailed assessment of the needs of the affected people after the passing of the floods. The post floods recovery needs assessment (PFRNA) was led by the Government of Nepal’s National Planning Commission (NPC) in coordination with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and other line ministries. The objective of the assessment was to estimate the effects and impact of 2017 floods that affected the Terai Region6 and identify recovery needs. The assessment will help the Government of Nepal and other key stakeholders (including NRCS) to develop a recovery programme to support the people affected by the floods.

2381459,"Africa: Giving communities a voice in disaster response National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies across Africa are set to improve the way they work with people affected by disasters, thanks to a newly trained team of community engagement and accountability (CEA) specialists who are ready to be deployed whenever and wherever needed.

The CEA Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) members can be sent to emergencies across Africa to help the Red Cross and Red Crescent increase their reach, impact and levels of community participation during a disaster response. This includes establishing systems such as feedback and complaints hotlines, tools for social and behaviour change communication including mobile cinemas, radio programmes and SMS, and approaches that help improve understanding of community needs.

Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré, Africa Director for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), explained: “Working in partnership with communities has always been at the heart of the work of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. We know that engaging with communities leads to better quality operations, which support the goal of reducing vulnerability and building safer, more resilient communities.

“However, across the Movement and more broadly within the humanitarian sector, there is still a gap between rhetoric and reality. Often, in our haste to deliver assistance, we can overlook the capacities of local communities and, without meaning to, undermine them. This training highlights the commitment of the IFRC in Africa to improve the way we work with communities during emergencies and ensure we always put their needs, capacities and priorities front and centre.”

**Comprehensive training**

Twenty-nine participants from 16 African National Societies – Benin, Burundi, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Zambia – were trained at the event, which was held in Nairobi, Kenya from 22-29 November and organized by IFRC.

Participants covered general IFRC emergency response and RDRT deployment processes and procedures during the first two days. The following days involved learning about CEA in emergency response operations and participating in a live field simulation exercise.

This exercise was carried out in an informal settlement in Nairobi, where Kenya Red Cross Society has an active cholera response. During day one, participants assessed the communities’ knowledge, practices and beliefs about cholera and how and where they access information and provide feedback. On the second day, participants ran a mobile cinema and live radio show on cholera prevention, sent out SMS to community members, and set up a system to track rumours circulating about cholera that affect how people protect themselves.

CEA is increasingly recognized as essential to operational excellence, building acceptance and trust, and contributing to long-term community resilience. The approach ensures local actors and

communities are leaders and equal partners in humanitarian response, and that programmes and operations are driven by the voices of the most vulnerable people.

The recently published International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Guide to Community Engagement and Accountability helps implementers in the field to take a more people-centered and participatory approach when working with communities.

The hurricane resulted in catastrophic damage to critical infrastructure and left the island’s entire population of 3.4 million people literally and figuratively in the dark, and in urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance.

""Maria survivors are encountering enormous challenges navigating the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) bureaucratic and opaque assistance process and lack sufficient information on whether, when, and how they will be assisted.""

In late November, Refugees International (RI) conducted a mission to Puerto Rico to assess the protection and assistance needs of the most vulnerable hurricane survivors. This was RI’s first mission within the United States in the organization’s 38-year history. Our goal was to provide insights and expertise based on RI’s long history of advocating for improvements in responses to international humanitarian crises and our experience in similar acute, sudden-onset, weather-related disasters in foreign countries, including island nations.

At the time of RI’s mission to Puerto Rico, more than two months after the storm hit, our team encountered a response by federal and Puerto Rican authorities that was still largely uncoordinated and poorly implemented and that was prolonging the humanitarian emergency on the ground. While food and bottled water are now widely available and hospitals and clinics back up and running, thousands of people still lack sustainable access to potable water and electricity and dry, safe places to sleep. Moreover, Maria survivors are encountering enormous challenges navigating the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) bureaucratic and opaque assistance process and lack sufficient information on whether, when, and how they will be assisted.

""International best practices endorsed by USAID and other international humanitarian agencies should be brought to bear both in Puerto Rico and in future U.S. disasters.""

The horrendous conditions that tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans - many of whom are poor and elderly - continue to endure require the Trump Administration and Congress to prioritize needs and corresponding response programs. FEMA and Puerto Rican authorities, with support from the highest levels of the U.S. federal government, must immediately adopt a more streamlined, coordinated, transparent, and effective strategy that includes, among other things, ensuring that survivors have access to safe and secure accommodations while longer-term recovery programs get up and running. In doing so, international best practices endorsed by the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) and other international humanitarian agencies should be brought to bear both in Puerto Rico and in future U.S. disasters. In addition, affected populations must be provided with better and easier-to-comprehend information on FEMA’s assistance process.

The 2016–2017 drought across the Horn of Africa has contributed to failed harvests,extensive livestock deaths and food insecurity. Key informant interviews conducted with humanitarian and development actors, donors and forecasters in Ethiopia and Kenya reveal lessons on using forecasts to trigger early action for humanitarian and development practitioners.

**key lessons**

• Slow-onset disasters like drought have a built-in window of time after the rains fail but before widespread impacts are felt, when organisations can act early based on observations of changes in pasture or vegetation.

• Flexible funding and crisis modifiers make efficient use of existing non-governmental organisation (NGO) infrastructure and relationships. They should be accessed earlier to make it possible to anticipate and dissuade negative coping strategies before they happen.

• NGOs should engage with technical experts to ensure forecasts delivered as a climate service are genuinely useful, delivered to people who can take appropriate action and communicated in a way that triggers such action. Further work should focus on scalable climate service models that use existing government structures and enable government leadership to strengthen resilience.",4591,"Disaster Management"

Over the next few weeks, weekly editorials will focus on the laboratory and its role in surveillance and disease control. Focus areas of discussion will include functions of the laboratory in surveillance/Epidemiology, establishing laboratory support for Public Health Surveillance and the role of the laboratory before, during and after an outbreak.

Firstly, it is imperative for the functions of the laboratory in Surveillance/Epidemiology to be highlighted. This will provide clarity on the responsibilities and expectations of the laboratory in disease surveillance. The functions include:

1. Confirmation of etiology of diseases to resolve syndromic presentation

2. Building data intelligence for

•  Antimicrobial resistance monitoring

•  Emergence of unusual isolates

•  Detection of new pathogens

•  Sero-surveillance

3. Outbreak detection within the laboratory

•  Tracing spread through typing and characterization

•  Detection of carriers and natural foci of infection

4. Determine the end of an outbreak

5. Determine elimination or eradication of disease

6. Outbreak detection and investigations of which, results inform response activities to be undertaken.

7. Develop case definition of priority diseases, particularly on identifying markers for specific disease conditions.

8. Determine case management modalities of some diseases where serial testing of infected individuals can provide estimation of treatment provided e.g. serial testing for Lassa fever cases to ascertain extent of viral load in patients during the course of the treatment

9. Environmental monitoring

10. Understand the natural history of disease

11. Evaluate interventions

12. Monitor progress towards control

13. Develop immunization strategies. This will include identification of different serotypes which will inform vaccine development towards a specified serotype of a causative organism

14. Prevalence Studies.

In a bid to drive home the importance of a strong laboratory system, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) organised a Laboratory Consultative Meeting with partners during the week, to review the NCDC strategy and implementation plan (2017-2021). The focus for the laboratory is to enhance laboratory capacity to support disease surveillance, prevention and control. This meeting served as a platform to brainstorm and harness ideas as well as deepen commitment towards building a strong laboratory network system in the country. The NCDC strategy and implementation plan (2017-2021) can be assessed on the NCDC website www.ncdc.gov.ng

2379644,"Hurricane rains 15 percent worse due to climate change, scientists find **""This analysis makes clear that extreme rainfall events along the Gulf Coast are on the rise""**

*By Sebastien Malo*

NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The rains of Hurricane Harvey that devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast this summer were 15 percent higher due to climate change, which is making such catastrophic storms three times more common, new research shows.

The storm dropped more than 50 inches (127 cm) in some areas and caused disastrous flooding in Texas and Louisiana, said World Weather Attribution, a coalition of U.S., European and Australian scientists.

Experts, including United Nations meteorologists, had established that the deluge was linked to climate change, given the scientific consensus that global warming increases rainfall because warmer air holds more moisture.

But the study, published this week in Environmental Research Letters, a scientific journal, breaks new ground by measuring the portion of rainfall that can be pinned to global warming.

It said the rainfall was 15 percent higher than it would have been without climate change, and such historic rains are three times more common along the Gulf of Mexico coast than they were a century ago.

""This analysis makes clear that extreme rainfall events along the Gulf Coast are on the rise,"" the scientists wrote.

Harvey made landfall in Texas on August 25 and lingered over the coast for several days.

The strongest hurricane to hit the state in more than 50 years, it was blamed for more than 80 deaths. Damage in Houston, the country's fourth biggest city, has been estimated at $198 billion.

The likelihood of another storm on the same scale is about once in 100 years, compared with once in 160 years without global warming, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the study's lead author, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

To measure the impact of climate change, the researchers used a technique known as event attribution, which has become more effective due to advances in computing power.

The process involves a network of computers comparing weather scenarios with and without climate change, using an array of models with historic climate data.

The study shows the need to plan reconstruction with more extreme rains and flooding in mind, said study co-author Antonia Sebastian, a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University in Houston.

""Our hazards are changing over time,"" she said in a statement. ""We should be considering those changes in the design of our infrastructure.""

An agreement to tackle climate change by limiting the use of fossil fuels was reached by more than 190 countries in Paris in 2015.

President Donald Trump, who has said he thinks climate change is a hoax, has pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement, and his administration has weakened environmental protections.

2379389,"ISCG Situation Report: Rohingya Refugee Crisis, Cox’s Bazar - 17 December 2017 **Highlights**

- 655,000 new arrivals (Since 25th August) are reported as of 17 December (IOM Needs and Population Monitoring and UNHCR Family Counting).

- As of 15 December, the Bangladeshi Immigration and Passports Department has registered 844,207 people through biometric registration.

- As of 15 December, the Armed Forced Division (AFD) has completed 6.74 kilometers of earthworks on the main road in the Kutupalong Balukhali extension.

- As of 15 December, The Local Government and Engineering Department has completed 9.25 kilometers of 10 different access roads. This project is 90% complete.

- 655,000 Cumulative arrivals since 25 Aug

- 547,000 Total in Kutupalong- Balukhali Expansion Site

- 242,000 Total in other settlements and camps

- 79,000 Total in host communities

**Situation Overview**

- Violence in Rakhine State which began on 25 August 2017 has driven an estimated 655,000 Rohingya across the border into Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The speed and scale of the influx has resulted in a critical humanitarian emergency. The people who have arrived in Bangladesh since 25 August came with very few possessions. They have used most their savings on transportation and constructing a shelter, often out of no more than bamboo and thin plastic. They are now reliant on humanitarian assistance for food, and other life-saving needs. Basic services that were available prior to the influx are under severe strain due to the massive increase in people in the area. In some of the sites that have spontaneously emerged, water and sanitation facilities are limited or of poor quality, with extremely high density raising the risks of an outbreak of disease. The Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar is highly vulnerable, having fled conflict and experienced severe trauma, and now living in extremely difficult conditions.

- Population movements within Cox’s Bazar remain highly fluid, with increasing concentration in Ukhia, where the Government has allocated 3,000 acres for a new camp. People have begun arriving at the new, proposed site before infrastructure and services can be established. Crucially there is limited access to the site and few roads through this site; this is limiting the development of infrastructure including water and sanitation facilities.",4591,"Disaster Management"
2378529,"Improving school safety in Mozambique Disasters have a major impact on children, youth and education systems. Studies of disaster trends and the likely consequences of climate change suggest that each year 175 million children are likely to be affected by natural hazard related disasters alone. Mozambique is taking steps to improve the safety of its educational infrastructure, using a methodology developed by UNESCO and the University of Udine’s SPRINT-Lab, which facilitates risk assessments in school facilities and provides fact-based practical information to help decision-makers identify areas of concern and prioritize investments.

The pilot project involved a stakeholders’ workshop to introduce the method and establish key partnerships for its adaptation to the Mozambican context, and several workshops to build local capacities to use the methodology and train relevant staff. Mozambique’s Ministry of Education and Human Development aims to apply the UNESCO-VISUS methodology for multi-hazard school safety assessment to about 100 schools in this initial phase of implementation.

The stakeholders’ workshop, held in September 2017, was facilitated by Jair Torres, UNESCO, and Professor Edgar Peña, University of El Salvador, both VISUS experts who participated in the very first pilot implementation of this project in El Salvador in 2013. Implementation then began in November, with a series of trainings. The first covered the application and use of the UNESCO-VISUS methodology by decision makers. The second focused on the theoretical aspects of the methodology, to train teachers of the University of Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) as well as technical staff of the Ministry of Education and Human Development and of the National Institute for Disaster Management of Mozambique (INGC).

The third and last workshop focused on the practical use of the methodology for assessments on the ground. Participants included teachers of the Faculty of Architecture of the UEM, as well as last-year students, who are now able to conduct risk assessments in schools using the methodology. The training concluded with a practical exercise: to survey six schools in Maputo City. The six schools surveyed were EPC (Complete Primary School) 3 de Fevereiro, EPC “A luta continua”, EPC São António de Polana, EPC do Alto Mãe, EPC de Mikadjuine, and EPC Unidade 7.

With their training completed on 1 December, these professors, teachers, and students are now applying their knowledge to conduct a survey and assessment of 94 schools in the Maputo, Gaza, and Inhambane provinces. They are using VISUS paper codification forms as well as a dedicated mobile phone app, VISUS Finder. The data from the school survey and field assessment will be then processed and validated by the Safety and Protection Intersectoral (SPRINT) Lab of the Polytechnic Department of Engineering and Architecture of the University of Udine, Italy – UNESCO’s Scientific Partner for the VISUS methodology, and a UNESCO Chair on Safety Assessment.

Once the validation is complete, this data will be available as individuals school reports for each school, and as a collective report addressed to the decision-makers of the Ministry of Education and Human Development of Mozambique. The individual reports will then be shared in a mapping tool as geolocalized data (GIS format). The conclusions of the surveys conducted during the pilot phase will be presented to the Government of Mozambique in the beginning of 2018. They will provide ready-to-use science-based information on school safety, to enable Mozambican decision-makers to make informed decisions about school safety and upgrading, allowing them to improve budgeting and to prioritize interventions and expenditures.

The implementation of the UNESCO-VISUS methodology for multi-hazard school safety assessment in Mozambique was supported by UNESCO, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the Belgian Development Cooperation Agency.",4591,"Disaster Management"
2378344,"NDMA Launches Guidelines for Minimum Standards of Relief in Camps National Disaster Management Authority, (NDMA) has formally launched the Guidelines for Minimum Standards of Relief in Camps here on Thursday. Chairman NDMA Lt. Gen Omar Mahmood Hayat HI (M), was the chief guest at the Launching Ceremony.

While speaking at the occasion Chairman NDMA has said during disaster Relief Camps remain the centre point of relief and rehabilitation activities. He observed development of Guidelines for Minimum Standards of Relief in Camps was essential for establishment of Relief Camps when necessary and for carrying out relief activities smoothly according to minimum international standards. He hoped that these guidelines would prove vital assistance to the provincial and district governments and other relevant stakeholders working in the area of disaster management.

While highlighted the objective of the Guidelines Member, Operations NDMA Brigadier Mukhtar Ahmed has said that these Guidelines are to assist Provincial, District and sub-divisional administration and non-government sector for effective and efficient management of provision of minimum standards of relief in camp(s) for the well-being of camp inhabitants.

It is one of key functions of NDMA is to lay down guidelines and provide direction to the departments concerned or Provincial Governments to take appropriate measures in response to any threatening disaster or disaster situation. Section 11 (a) of NDM Act 2010 stipulates NDMA to lay down Guidelines for minimum requirements to be provided in relief camps in relation to shelter, food, drinking water, medical cover and sanitation to persons affected by disaster.

In this backdrop, NDMA formulated these “Guidelines for Minimum Standard of Relief in Camps” in consultation with IOM, UNHCR, and SPEHER. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has approved these Guidelines while the same Guidelines will be presented before National Disaster Management Commission (NDMC) for ratification.",4591,"Disaster Management"
2378099,"Dominicans start paving their way to a more resilient future Roseau – 12 December – Over 800 hurricane-affected Dominicans have received training and are being temporarily employed as part of the National Employment Programme, a UNDP-backed strategy to place affected people at the centre of the recovery process after hurricane Maria decimated the island nation three months ago.

“The temporary employment opportunity is crucial to inject needed cash in communities, especially considering that many women and men have seen their livelihoods greatly affected,” said UNDP Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Jessica Faieta as she spoke to several Dominicans employed by the Cash-For-Work programme today.

Nearly half (45 percent) of the total number of temporarily hired workers is a woman, earning over twice the Dominican minimum wage until around mid 2018.

For the past three weeks they have been clearing debris around health facilities, roads, schools and also in rivers, which will enable the reconstruction process.

Damage assessment - In the meantime a UNDP-backed Building Damage Assessment, led by the Ministry of Housing, working with Engineers Without Borders is ongoing. Microsoft has provided tablets and a tailored app, which is currently enabling the assessment of roofs, walls, floors and structures in addition to demographic details such as number of people affected with crucial data about affected people such as sex, age. Such information will be crucial for the Government of Dominica to better address people’s recovery needs, also tailoring public policies to the most at-need communities after the hurricane. More than 17,000 buildings have been assessed thus far by over 100 Dominicans who are currently covering the entire island nation.

**Building back better** -  Moreover, the Ministry of Planning of Dominica, together with Engineers Without Borders and UNDP developed new Housing Standards for enhanced earthquake/hurricane resistance in consultation with the associations of architects, builders, contractors and engineers. The document will now be submitted for approval by the Council of Ministers.

A training programme will be carried out over the next few weeks with the objective to certify builders and contractors on the new housing standards.",4591,"Disaster Management"
2377864,"Agriculture takes a leap forward at Bonn Climate Talks UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Programme highlights need for sectoral adaptation planning  
  
Bonn, Germany – The signature decision on agriculture coming out of this year's climate talks in Bonn, called the [Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj2tOfhwYrYAhUO12MKHR4-CyAQFggpMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Funfccc.int%2Ffiles%2Fmeetings%2Fbonn_nov_2017%2Fapplication%2Fpdf%2Fcp23_auv_agri.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1quagaS9tMkkvzIIMZ6K-l), provides a new opportunity to address how climate change impacts on agricultural production have put millions of lives and livelihoods at risk worldwide.  
  
""This bold landmark decision brings agriculture to the forefront of the international climate change agenda, and looks directly at important issues such as assessing adaptation and mitigation benefits of agriculture, improving soil health, nutrient management and livestock systems, and addressing the socio-economic and food security issues associated with climate change in the agriculture sectors,"" said Julia Wolf, Natural Resource Officer and Coordinator from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for the joint UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans Programme [(NAP-Ag)](http://adaptation-undp.org/naps-agriculture%3E).  
  
Agriculture has been an agenda item within the UNFCCC's Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) since 2011. Parties and observers are invited to submit views, by 31 March 2018, on what elements should be included in the work programme, particularly on modalities for the implementation of outcomes from the five workshops held on matters related to agriculture during the years of negotiations.  
  
""This decision allows us to take new steps to address the role of agriculture in National Adaptation Plans and in particular contributing to the achievement of the Paris Agreement Goal on adaptation, while promoting poverty reduction, safeguarding livelihoods and promoting resilient societies,"" said Rohini Kohli, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) coordinator for the NAP-Ag Programme.  
  
During COP23 in Bonn, a NAP-Ag side-event, with presence from partner countries, the [Green Climate Fund](http://www.greenclimate.fund/home); and [Global Water Partnership](http://www.gwp.org/), underscored the need to engage the private sector, implement gender-responsive approaches and improve local climate governance to connect the agriculture sectors with more effective climate change adaptation plans.  
  
In her introduction to the session, Wolf underscored the need to leverage finance for National Adaptation Plans to ensure the integration of agricultural sectors by tapping into existing synergies and activities at national level.  
  
**Addressing climate risks in Uganda**  

In [Uganda](http://adaptation-undp.org/naps-agriculture/partner-countries/uganda), 72 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, out of which 77 percent are women and 63 percent are youth. But women have less access to resources such as land, tools and seeds, and are less engaged than men in the higher rungs of the value chain for agricultural products, according to Stephen Muwaya, Senior Range Ecologist from the Uganda Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.  
Muwaya highlighted NAP-Ag Programme support on gender analysis in Uganda to ensure that the unique impact of climate change on women and youth is fully reflected in climate change adaptation plans.  
Muwaya also indicated that one of these important synergies lies in connecting resilience of cropping, livestock, fisheries and integrated fishers resource management into adaptation plans.  
  
To execute these plans more effectively, Uganda is working to build more effective climate information services, early warning systems and [disaster preparedness](http://adaptation-undp.org/projects/ldcf-ews-uganda).  
  
Climate change adaptation projects are also being careful to involve both men and women in learning activities, ensuring that a fair number of trainers are women, promoting gender-inclusive climate-smart technologies, engaging young people through school programmes, and leveraging Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to share weather and market information.  
  
**Local community action in the Philippines**  

Another example of how agriculture is being integrated into climate change adaptation planning comes from the [Philippines](http://adaptation-undp.org/naps-agriculture/partner-countries/philippines), where climate change, new pests and disease, and the destruction of coastal habitats threaten yields from staple crops and is undermining efforts to build more climate resilient livelihoods.  
  
The vision of the Philippines, according to Lerey A. Panes from the Philippines' Department of Agriculture, is to enable local communities to manage climate risks while pursuing sustainable livelihoods. The Government of the Philippines is achieving this goal through its flagship Adaptation and Mitigation Initiatives in Agriculture programme (AMIA)[(http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/environment-energy/mdg-carbon/NAMAs/adaptation-and-mitigation-initiatives-in-philippine-rice-cultiva.html%3E).  
  
The programme, which started in 2015, seeks to support the introduction of climate relevant technologies at the local level across the country, working in very close collaboration with municipalities and the local communities.  
  
Through AMIA model villages, the programme is sharing climate information services, disaster risk reduction tools, training and computer-aided decision-making technology, while also working to ease access to credit, insurance and improved market access.  
  
In its next phase, the Philippines will be scaling up the AMIA programme to contribute in achieving 9 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Phillippines was referred to as a NAP Champion in a separate side event hosted by the UNFCCC. NAP-Ag programme support was acknowledged for assisting in the integration of the AMIA programme into an increased number of sectoral and national policies in the Philippines.  
  
**International partnership**  

Effectively integrating agriculture into adaptation plans will require continued international support, capacity building, improved evidence-based decision making, and partnerships across a variety of related sectors.  

Jason Spensley, Manager of the Green Climate Fund's Project Preparation Facility and Adaptation Planning Support Programme, underscored the need for Nationally Designated Authorities to look at specific climate change issues and related sectors when formulating project proposals and adaptation plans in order to leverage support from the most adequate sources.  
  
The Global Water Partnership [(GWP)](http://www.gwp.org/%3E), represented by its Executive Secretary for Southern Africa Alex Simalabwi, highlighted the need for partnerships in addressing multidimensional issues like water in these multi-sector approaches.  
  
Approximately 50 participants attended the Bonn side event, including the Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industries, and Fisheries of Uganda, his Excellency Ssempijja V. Bamulangaki.  
  
At the event, the NAP-Ag Programme officially launched a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on [National Adaptation Plans: Building Climate Resilience in Agriculture](https://napmooc.uncclearn.org/). The ongoing course, developed in partnership with UNITAR, provides step-by-step guidance on ways to integrate agriculture in climate change adaptation planning processes, and is an important learning tool in achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement, Sendai Framework and 2030 Agenda.  
  
In her closing remarks, Lea Herberg, from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) highlighted the need to bring the private sector into the financing mix.  
  
""The NAP-Ag programme is helping unpack the National Adaptation Plans process,"" said Herberg. ""Sectoral integration is key for the success of adaptation planning.""  
  
The joint UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Programme supports partner countries to identify and integrate climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sectors into relevant national planning and budgeting processes.

2377759,"Asia prioritizes Sendai Target (e) *By Andy McElroy*

BANGKOK, 15 December 2017 – Governments and stakeholder partners from across Asia have renewed their commitment to a substantial increase in the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020.

The call for action on Target (e) of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the global plan to reduce disaster losses, was made this week at the ISDR Asia Partnership (IAP), an inter-governmental and stakeholder forum that meets biannually.

Officials from 19 governments, three inter-governmental regional organization plus representatives from various stakeholders have been meeting in Bangkok this week to review progress on disaster risk reduction in the region and to support preparations for the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction 2018 (AMCDRR 2018), in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

The IAP welcomed the focus of the AMCDRR 2018 on achieving target (e) under the overall conference theme ‘Preventing Disaster Risk: Protecting Sustainable Development’. It is one of seven Sendai Framework targets seeking to bring about a substantial reduction in disaster losses by 2030.

Countries represented were Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Japan, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.

Ms. Sayanaa Lkhagvasuren, Senior Advisor to the Deputy Prime Minister of Mongolia, Mr. U. Enkhtuvshin, who is responsible for disaster risk reduction, said hosting the AMCDRR 2018 was a huge opportunity for both Mongolia and Asia.

“We are determined to demonstrate our country’s regional leadership on key aspects of DRR, including the achievement of target (e) as well as urban resilience and the importance of public-private partnerships,” Ms. Lkhagvasuren said.

“We are also using the AMCDRR as a way of increasing awareness of disaster resilience in our own country, right down to the local level.”

UNISDR Chief of Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, Ms. Loretta Hieber Girardet heralded the IAP’s focus on practical recommendations as an example of regional coordination in action that will translate into a positive impact on protecting lives and livelihoods.

“The overall trend of increasing disaster risk reinforces the need to scale up implementation of the Sendai Framework. The IAP and AMCDRR 2018 are regional mechanisms that galvanize action in disaster resilience at the local and national level,” Ms. Hieber Girardet said.

The AMCDRR 2018 is being co-organized by the Government of Mongolia and UNISDR. It will take place in Ulaanbaatar 16-19 July 2018.

The Prime Minister of Mongolia, Mr. U. Khurelsukh, is UNISDR’s newest DRR Champion for Asia, receiving the award at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, in Cancun, Mexico, in May this year. He continues to champion the DRR agenda particularly in terms of urban resilience and the role of youth as change agents.

The IAP was opened by Ms. Kirsi Madi, Director of UNISDR, and attracted 100 participants with representatives from governments, intergovernmental, UN and international organizations, business, academia, civil society, the Red Cross and Red Crescent and various other stakeholder groups and sectors.

Representatives provided technical and strategic input to the six main Technical Sessions for the AMCDRR 2018 that cover the four priorities of the Sendai Framework – understanding risk; governance; investing in DRR; and preparedness for response and build back better – as well as monitoring implementation of the Sendai Framework and coherence of the overall development agenda.",4591,"Disaster Management"

2377439,"EU offers € 2 million to boost disaster preparedness in the Caribbean _The announcement was made during the Caribbean Conference on Comprehensive Disaster Management to strengthen disaster risk reduction and early warning systems through knowledge exchange_

**December 9, Nassau, Bahamas**. Following the unprecedented destruction caused by some of the most powerful hurricanes to ever cross the Atlantic, the European Union offered 2 million euros (US$2.35 million) to support two Caribbean disaster risk reduction initiatives.

The announcement came during the 10th Caribbean Conference on Comprehensive Disaster Management CDM: The Road to Resilience - Checkpoint 2017 “Building Resilience through Partnerships” here today, supporting of the DIPECHO (Disaster Preparedness Programme) Action Plan for the Caribbean, launched, under the auspices of the General Directorate of Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid of the European Union (ECHO). The financial support will be used in two regional initiatives. The first one, ""Strengthen integrated early warning systems for a more effective disaster risk reduction in the Caribbean through knowledge and the transfer of tools"", is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent (IFRC) and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA). The second, ""Ponte Alerta Caribe: Harmonizing Risk Management Strategies and Tools with an Inclusive Approach in the Caribbean"" is implemented by the Oxfam consortium, Plan International, Habitat for Humanity and International Handicap.

These projects, which take place in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Cuba, seek to strengthen disaster preparedness and risk reduction through gathering and applying tested tools to generate risk information, improve monitoring and warnings, and ensure that messages reach communities, whose response capacities will also be strengthened through training sessions.    The projects will be implemented over an 18-month period to strengthen the prevention, mitigation and response capacities at both the institutional and community level, and will emphasize mutual learning and collaboration between countries and regional institutions working in disaster risk reduction across the Caribbean.  

The projects were launched at the 10th Caribbean Conference on Comprehensive Disaster Management, held from December 4 to 9 in Nassau, Bahamas and organized by CDEMA. It was attended by over 200 representatives of the national systems of prevention, mitigation and response of the Caribbean countries, National Red Cross Societies, representatives of the national and regional systems of meteorology and hydrology, as well as representatives of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean and the UNDP offices in Barbados, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, in addition to the IFRC, CDEMA, Oxfam, Handicap International, and ECHO.

All stakeholders, within the framework of the conference, reaffirmed their commitment to work in alignment with the Caribbean Comprehensive Disaster Management 2014-2024 strategy, recognizing the need for collaboration and exchange of good practices between the institutions of the Caribbean countries, especially given the recent hydro-meteorological events of the last hurricane season.",4591,"Disaster Management"
2376489,"Philippines Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 11 | December 2017 - January 2018 **Highlights**

- Thousands of IDPs are gradually returning to some areas of Marawi City and surrounding municipalities. Humanitarian needs of the affected population remain and will continue well into the new year.

- Non-governmental organizations who were displaced by the Marawi conflict reopen their field offices and continue operations.

- Marawi humanitarian actors participate in a Gender in Humanitarian Action training in Iligan City.

**Hope for lasting peace and safety: IDPs begin return to Marawi**

The gunfire has fallen silent in Marawi City since the military declared the end of the conflict in October. The hope of returning home has rekindled for over 350,000 internally displaced persons who sought refuge with host families and in evacuation centres for the last five months. Thousands of people returning to their barangays are finding out what is left of their properties and homes. The Government of the Philippines has started the phased return of Marawi City residents whose homes had minimum to medium damage. As of 10 December, the Government has facilitated the return of over 26,000 families following clearing operations by the military for unexploded ordnance and debris. The UN migration agency, IOM is assisting authorities with facilitating the safe and dignified return of the displaced to their places of origin. People from about one third of barangays affected by heavy fighting and destructions during the conflict may not be able to return soon. An estimated 9,500 families are from 24 barangays completely destroyed by the conflict.

As of early December, some shops in Basak Malutlut, Datu Saber, Poona and Amito Marantao barangays have opened for business. Fabrication of bricks for housing by private companies is picking up. The most affected areas are envisioned to be transformed to become the modern business area in the city, with support from the private sector. However, issues on land ownership need clarification in the rehabilitation and rebuilding of Marawi.

**Challenges of returning home**

Many of those who initially returned to Marawi have subsequently gone back to evacuation centres and host communities due to the delays in restoration of utilities, services, schools and livelihood opportunities.

Local markets are slowly returning, but restoring the food supply chain is one of the most immediate rehabilitation requirements and is crucial to complete the transition from emergency to recovery. Both returnees and displaced communities will need continued support to address their basic food and nutrition needs.

2376204,"CDB approves USD65.5mn in loans, grants to support disaster recovery efforts in the British Virgin Islands **December 14, 2017, BRIDGETOWN, Barbados –** The Board of Directors of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has approved USD65.5 million in loans and grants to the Government of the British Virgin Islands to assist with the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction of social and economic infrastructure, resulting from the cumulative effects of recent severe weather events.

**Daniel Best, Director, Projects Department, CDB** noted, “The Government of the British Virgin Islands’ preliminary assessment report estimates USD3 billion in damage and losses—the equivalent of three times the annual gross domestic product, from the passage of Hurricane Irma.”

“This project is a reflection of our commitment to providing and mobilising resources for recovery and reconstruction, and to improve climate resilience and socially inclusive infrastructure and institutions in our Borrowing Member Countries,” Best added.

The Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project aims to strengthen the socio-cultural and economic preparedness and resilience of the population of the British Virgin Islands to future climate-related hazards, while supporting the population in re-establishing sustainable livelihoods. This will be achieved through:

- the rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical social and economic infrastructure in the country’s transport, water and sewerage, governance, education and national security sectors;

- the provision of technical assistance in design and construction supervision services; and

- institutional strengthening for psychosocial support and disaster mitigation.

The Project will be supported through a USD65.2 million loan and a USD300,000 grant. It comprises several components, including:

- rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical climate-resilient social and economic infrastructure;

- enhancement of institutional capacity for: psychosocial support and disaster risk reduction;

- upgrade/reconstruction of 3.9 kilometres of roads;

- construction of approximately 900 metres of coastal defences;

- construction/upgrade of 12 educational institutions and recreation facilities;

- rehabilitation of nine public infrastructures;

- rehabilitation of 10 water and sewerage facilities;

- provision of information and communication technology equipment and other resources for 29 institutions; and

- training of 80 persons in providing psychosocial support services.

In October and November 2017, CDB approved three Immediate Response Loans on highly concessionary terms, totalling USD2.25 million and an Emergency Relief Grant of USD200,000 to the British Virgin Islands after the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Tropical Storm José. These funds assisted the Government in the provision of emergency relief supplies and humanitarian assistance, cleaning and clearing debris, as well as restoring critical infrastructure and essential public services.

The Project is consistent with the Bank’s strategic objective of promoting environmental sustainability and disaster risk management in its Borrowing Member Countries, and its corporate priority of promoting disaster risk management and climate change mitigation and adaptation.",4591,"Disaster Management"

2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",4592,"Education"
2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4592,"Education"
2392724,"IOM Regional Response to the Syria Crisis (November 2017) Suad was happily living in her village in Homs, Syria with her husband and six children, working as a tailor. All that changed when the war happened and fighting started in her village. Suad and her family decided to leave all their belongings behind and flee; walking over 1,000km until they reached Idleb. They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent. Suad decided to borrow money from her neighbours and buy an old, second-hand sewing machine to bring in a little income.  

Learning about IOM’s Project from her husband, Suad applied and was soon accept- ed. “You can’t believe how happy I feel.

2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",4592,"Education"

million people, half of the population of Somalia, will need humanitarian assistance and protection due
to the ongoing drought and conflict. Over two million IDPs are among those who are in urgent need of
assistance.1 Several reports by the monitoring agencies indicated that in a scenario of continued
assistance at current levels, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible. Large-scale assistance is
needed through 2018 to prevent the loss of lives and collapse of livelihoods.

""We were invited by Dubai Cares, a branch of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives, to organise this reading awareness and cultural campaign, that includes donating 200,000 books to Syrian refugee children in Jordan, starting at the UAE-Jordanian Camp, which is managed by the Emirates Red Crescent, ERC,"" he said.

Al Shaali thanked the ERC, represented by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ruler's Representative in Al Dhafra Region and Chairman of the ERC, as well as its Board of Directors and Secretary-General. He also thanked the UAE relief team, led by Mubarak Mohammed Al Khaili, Director of the Camp, who received the delegation, and the volunteers in the camp while expressing his admiration for the services offered to the Syrian refugees, which were explained by Al Khaili to the guests.

Al Shaali noted that his team entertained the children with puppet shows, adding that parents, guardians and teachers in the camp and other refugees camps will be given specialised courses, as part of a year-long project to promote correct nutrition and establish awareness via teaching practical skills and direct engagement, in partnership with Bidaya Media, which produces 'Iftah Ya Simsim', the Arabic version of Sesame Street.

Al Shaali described the camp as similar to an integrated city in terms of its level of care, education facilities, entertainment and library while noting that it has obtained ISO Quality Management certification, and is an international advancement, a source of pride, and part of the course taken and established by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

2391429,"UNHCR Somalia Repatriation Update, 1-30 November 2017 **Updates on Achievements** 

UNHCR together with government counterparts and partners continued providing assistance to Somali refugees who decided to voluntarily return home. To ensure sustainable reintegration of Somali refugee returnees, UNHCR provides the enhanced return package2 . Detailed achievements throughout November are presented below per sector.

**Protection and Return Support**

**Return Management**

■ The Government of Kenya have now authorized resumption of road convoys to Somalia but due to rainfalls in the region (Dhobley town, Lower Juba region), most of the return routes are not accessible, making return by road not feasible.

■ Flights to Kismayo have resumed on 21 November. The suspension was put in place on 28 September after the State of Jubaland imposed new landing fees on UN flights. The last return flight from Kenya to Kismayo was received on 28 September.

**Protection Monitoring**

■ UNHCR has shared the Country of Origin Information (COI) for the month of October with the Return Help Desk in Refugee Camps in Kenya and Yemen. The COI includes information about the humanitarian, security and political situation in Somalia. The COI helps Somali refugees make an informed decision about their return.

■ During November, the pilot phase of UNHCR’s new post-returns monitoring system commenced across South Central Somalia. Consultations were held with partners in Mogadishu before the rollout of the telephonic monitoring began. The new monitoring system includes a face-to-face survey.

**Return Figures**

Since the beginning of repatriation in 2014, a total of 109,317 Somalis returned to Somalia; 74,606 from Kenya, 34,077 from Yemen (33,667 spontaneous and 418 assisted) and 626 from other countries of asylum (589 from Djibouti, 34 from Eritrea, two from Tunisia, and one from Pakistan).

■ From 1 to 30 November, 819 Somalis returned home, 663 from Kenya and 156 spontaneous returnees from Yemen.",4592,"Education"
2391354,"UNHCR welcomes Britain’s support for South Sudanese refugees in Sudan [EN/AR] **Khartoum, Sudan, 21 December 2017** - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today welcomed a multi-year contribution of £7.5 million (approximately US$9.9 million) spread over three years from the Government of the United Kingdom to respond to the critical needs of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan, and those anticipated to arrive between 2018 and 2020.

UNHCR will use the funds to provide life-saving assistance to respond to the vital needs of the South Sudanese refugees as well as host communities in White Nile; West and South Kordofan; and East and South Darfur in the area of protection, water and sanitation, and education. The funds will also allow UNHCR to procure non-food items, such as blankets, sleeping mats and cooking kits, for this vulnerable population. South Sudanese refugees arrive in Sudan in very poor condition, exhausted after long walks to reach the borders and in urgent need of protection, especially children who have lost or been separated from their families during the journey.

Dr. Christopher Pycroft, Head of the Department for International Development in Sudan, said “The unfolding tragedy in South Sudan has had terrible human consequences. The British people stand by those affected by conflict and famine, and commit to continue to support the hundreds of thousands of women and children who have been forced to flee their own country, by providing them with safety, food and water and a roof over their heads. DFID has committed to provide this assistance over three years to help our partner UNHCR, and the other aid agencies involved, to plan ahead and deliver life-saving assistance on the ground more effectively, and to help ensure that children continue to have access to Education even during this time of crisis.”

The UK has been a major donor to UNHCR in Sudan for years, contributing over £ 14.8 million (around US$ 20.8 million) in the past four years. This has enabled UNHCR to assist refugees in the country and has greatly contributed to supporting the South Sudan response since the early days of the crisis.  
Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR’s Representative in Sudan particularly welcomed this multi-year agreement and said: “The United Kingdom has consistently demonstrated its commitment to UNHCR activities to assist the most vulnerable children and people from South Sudan. In an operational context that can change very quickly, this multi-year funding will give more predictability and flexibility to UNHCR to respond more efficiently and at scale when a crisis hits and help respond to expected needs in 2018 as part of our contingency planning”.

To date, close to 453,000 South Sudanese have crossed into Sudan since December 2013, and are now residing across 9 states, in addition with an estimated 350,000 remaining in Sudan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.

Sudan continues to open its borders to refugees seeking safety in the country, which is critical as the conflict in South Sudan is becoming ever more complex in parallel with a worsening food security situation.

2391289,"Gaza Situation Report 213, 8 December – 19 December 2017 **HIGHLIGHTS**

- On 6 December, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres said following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that, “Jerusalem  is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides”. To read the full statement, please click here.

- For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which has further undermined an already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 2017 in the context of disputes between the de-facto authorities in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely impacted the availability of essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and has undermined Gaza’s fragile economy, especially the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. In the already impoverished Gaza Strip, residents have learned to adapt to the fact that electricity is only available for between two and four hours a day. The shortages have defined how people live their lives: getting up in the middle of the night if there is power to run washing machines or turn on water pumps. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory, electricity blackouts in Gaza last between 19-21 hours each day. Families in Gaza are forced to spend a large part of their income on energy, whether on the meagre supply of electricity they receive through high voltage lines, or on the cost of fuel, generators and their repair.

- A ceremony to mark the International Day of Human Rights was organized by the UNRWA Field Education Programme at Beach Preparatory Girls School A in Beach camp, western Gaza city, on 11 December. The Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, and other senior UNRWA staff as well as teachers, students and their parents attended the event. The event included activities such as songs, sketches and a drawing competition for the students. The parents also participated in an activity where they shared their views on gender equality and non-discrimination in the Gaza Strip, wishing for a better future for all. For over ten years UNRWA has been integrating human rights, conflict resolution and tolerance in its school activities. In May 2012, the Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA. This policy builds upon past successes, but also draws from international best practices and paves the way to better integrate human rights education in all our schools.

- An online lecture with the Japanese Research Syowa Station in Antarctica was conducted via Skype to a group of 30 students from two UNRWA schools on 11 December 2017. Dr. Hirofumi Oe, the station’s medical doctor, introduced the life in Antarctica and the mission of the research station to the students. The lecture lasted for two hours and included a presentation with photos and videos followed by an open discussion during which the students raised a number of questions such as the impact of climate change on the world, and Antarctica in particular. Commenting on the lecture, Dr. Hirofumi expressed his pleasure in speaking with UNRWA students in Gaza, explaining the environment of Antarctica, and the purpose and activities of the Japanese research mission there. The lecture was a great opportunity to widen both the knowledge and horizon of students in Gaza. Freedom of movement outside Gaza is virtually non-existent due to the blockade; 90 per cent of the over 271,900 students from UNRWA schools have never left the Gaza Strip in their lives. The UNRWA Education Programme recognizes the critical need for students to understand and connect with the world, and hence always seeks to implement innovative projects through which refugee students can link to, and share knowledge and ideas with, their peers and others in the rest of the world.

- UNRWA in Gaza celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 4 December 2017. The ceremony took place at the UNRWA Gaza Field Office compound and was attended by UNRWA Director of Operations, Mr. Matthias Schmale, Chief of the Field Relief and Social Services Programme, Mr. Asem Abu Shawish, UNRWA senior staff as well as heads of community rehabilitation centres that provide support to persons with disabilities across the Gaza Strip. The ceremony included speeches by Mr. Schmale, representatives from the coordination committee of the community rehabilitation centres, and a representative of persons with disabilities. It also included many uplifting performances by children with disabilities. The disability sub-programme of the UNRWA Relief and Social Services Programme provides various forms of support to people with disabilities and assists vulnerable groups of Palestine refugees through community social interventions. It conducts activities through 19 Community-Based Organizations, 7 Women’s Programme Centres, 7 Community-Based Rehabilitation Centres for persons with disabilities and 5 Youth Activity Centres.

- During the reporting period, as part of his regular outreach visits, the Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, visited Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, and Gaza City. During the visit to Khan Younis camp, the Director met with a beneficiary family receiving Social Safety Net support due to their extreme poverty and visited UNRWA Abu Teama Preparatory Co-ed school. In his visit to Gaza city, Mr. Schmale met with members of the School Parliament and their teachers at the UNRWA Gaza Preparatory Girls A, and then proceeded to Tuffah Distribution Centre, a Community-Based Rehabilitation Centre and the Sheikh Radwan Health Centre. The visit was followed by a meeting with UNRWA Health Programme senior staff in which the Chief of the Field Health Programme, Dr. Ghada Al-Jadba, highlighted the programme’s achievements and challenges in 2017.

**OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT**

On 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 and 17 December, Palestinian civilians, staged protests near the perimeter fence in different areas of Gaza against the American president’s decision to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. When some of them approached the fence and threw stones towards Israeli observation posts, Israeli forces responded with gunfire and teargas. Two deaths and 258 injuries were reported.

On 7, 8, 9, 14 and 18 December, Israeli Forces fired missiles targeting militant training locations across the Gaza Strip in response to mortar shells fired by militants. Two deaths and 16 injuries were reported.

**UNRWA’S RESPONSE**

**THE UNRWA JOB CREATION PROGRAMME: PROVIDING A SOURCE OF INCOME AND STRENGTHENING SELF-RELIANCE**

The blockade of Gaza entered its 11th year in June 2017. The heavy restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza , in addition to the three consecutive conflicts and the internal political divide, have not only crushed the enclave’s formerly trade-based economy, they are also heavily responsible for the sky-rocketing unemployment rates. Extreme poverty, food insecurity and confinement contribute to depression, and hopelessness. According to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in Gaza was at 46.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.Even more dramatically, 71 per cent of females in Gaza are reportedly unemployed.
Through the UNRWA Job Creation Programme (JCP), the Agency works to mitigate the impact of the collapsed economy and labour market in Gaza by providing livelihood opportunities for Palestine refugees.

41-year-old Palestine refugee Enshirah Al-Batah, who lives with her nine-member family in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza Strip, received a three-month work opportunity as a labourer in an agriculture project in Beit Lahia as part of UNRWA’s JCP activities.

“I applied for a position in the UNRWA Job Creation Programme seven years ago. I felt blessed and happy when UNRWA called to inform me that I got a three-month job opportunity. Every morning I go to work with my colleagues and start my work with hope and passion. We pick and package strawberries and prepare them for possible export,” Enshirah said.

The programme targets both skilled and unskilled workers as well as professionals. Priority is given to applicants from households who have been assessed as living below the poverty line of less than US$ 3.87 per person per day; other criteria are gender, age, skills, or location. UNRWA aims to provide 40 per cent of skilled opportunities to women and 40 per cent of all job opportunities to youth. UNRWA also offers thousands of opportunities for graduates from Gaza universities through its Graduate Training Programme.

“This is my first paid job ever. Due to my family’s difficult economic conditions, I received little education. I can hardly read and write so it’s not easy to find a job. At the beginning, it was hard to adapt with the new routine, but now I can’t wait until morning comes to see my friends. I feel more confident and productive,” Enshirah added.

The Job Creation Programme provides not only a source of income, but also helps to restore self-respect, dignity and some form of self-reliance to thousands of Palestine refugees. The money earned through short-term job opportunities is mostly spent to cover basic needs such as medicine, fresh food, or clothes.

“I use the money I gain to repay my family debts and pay for my daughter’s college tuition. My dreams and hopes are simple. I dream of having a stable source of income,” Enshirah added.

In the first nine months of 2017, UNRWA created job opportunities for 16,515 beneficiaries, injecting US$ 12.4 million into the Gaza economy. To address high levels of youth unemployment in Gaza, a sub-component of the JCP – the Graduate Training Programme – offered 2,799 (out of the total of 16,515 jobs) opportunities to recent graduates in 2017 to date.

**FUNDING NEEDS**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget in 2017. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

Following the 2014 conflict, US$ 316 million has been pledged in support of UNRWA’s emergency shelter programme, for which an estimated US$ 720 million is required. This leaves a current shortfall of US$ 404 million. UNRWA urgently appeals to donors to generously contribute to its emergency shelter programme to provide displaced Palestine refugees in Gaza with rental subsidies or cash assistance to undertake reconstruction of their demolished homes.

As presented in UNRWA’s occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) Emergency Appeal for 2017, the Agency is seeking US$ 402 million to meet the minimum humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees in the oPt. The Gaza portion of the Emergency Appeal amounts to US$ 355 million for 2017, to address protracted, large scale humanitarian needs. More information can be found [here](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/emergency-appeals/opt-emergency-appeal-2017).

**CROSSINGS**

Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have undermined the living conditions of 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, Erez crossing and Kerem Shalom crossing. Rafah crossing is controlled by the Egyptian authorities and technically allows for the movement of a number of authorized travelers, Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases only. Erez crossing is controlled by Israeli authorities and technically allows for the movement of aid workers and limited numbers of authorized travelers, including Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases. Kerem Shalom crossing, also controlled by Israeli authorities, technically allows for the movement of authorized goods only.",4592,"Education"
2391269,"Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee Awarded $100 Million for Early Childhood Education of Syrian Refugees Three Finalists Awarded $15 Million Each in Global Competition for Bold Solutions to Critical Problems of Our Time

Chicago, Illinois, December 20, 2017 — The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation today awarded a $100 million grant to [Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee (IRC)](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/2017/) to educate young children displaced by conflict and persecution in the Middle East. 

The Foundation’s Board, deliberating among four finalists in *[100&Change](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/)*, MacArthur’s global competition for bold solutions to critical problems of our time, decided to award additional grants of $15 million to each of the other three finalists, based on the strength and potential impact of their proposals. The Foundation remains committed to helping the finalists attract the additional support their critical work requires. 

Sesame Workshop and IRC will use the $100 million grant to implement an evidence-based, early childhood development intervention designed to address the “toxic stress” experienced by children in the Syrian response region—Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria. The project will improve children’s learning outcomes today and their intellectual and emotional development over the long term. 

“We are compelled to respond to the urgent Syrian refugee crisis by supporting what will be the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting,” said MacArthur President Julia Stasch. “Less than two percent of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children. The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education.”

Each of the project’s three components is designed in consultation with local child development and curriculum experts, and each will help caregivers restore nurturing relationships and give their children the tools they need to overcome the trauma of conflict and displacement.

- Customized educational content and a new local version of Sesame Street – Delivered through television, mobile phones, digital platforms, and direct services in homes and communities, pan-Arab content will help provide an estimated 9.4 million young children the language, reading, math, and socioemotional skills they need to succeed in school and later in life. Embedded in the content, Sesame’s Muppets will model inclusion and respect, and gender equity, and they will provide engaging educational messages, always from a child’s perspective. All the content that is created will ultimately be publicly available at no cost. 

- Home visits reinforced with digital content – Home visitation and caregiving support sessions will connect trained local outreach and community health workers to 800,000 caregivers. Home visit content will promote caregiver responsiveness, early learning, mental well-being, and resiliency. The content will engage families through storybooks and picture books, parent brochures, caregiver guides, toys, developmentally appropriate games, digital content, and parenting resources via mobile devices. Direct services in homes and centers will reach 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children. 

- Child development centers – Sesame and IRC will transform community sites, formal and informal schools, and other points of aid into nurturing care and learning centers. Centers will be equipped with storybooks, video clips on pre-loaded projectors, activity sheets, and training guides to enable age-appropriate, play-based learning. 

“The Syrian refugee crisis is the humanitarian issue of our time and we are deeply grateful for this incredible opportunity,” said Jeffrey D. Dunn, President & CEO of Sesame Workshop. “For almost 50 years, Sesame has worked around the world to improve the lives of children and help them to grow smarter, stronger and kinder. This may be our most important initiative ever and we are humbled by the trust and confidence that has been placed in us. These children are, arguably, the world’s most vulnerable and by improving their lives we create a more stable and secure world for us all.”

Sesame Workshop has a long record of developing local versions of Sesame Street in places like Bangladesh, India, Afghanistan and South Africa. And the IRC brings its long and deep engagement in the refugee community and an established network of community workers and local facilities to the partnership. Sesame and IRC will receive the $100 million grant over five years and in accordance with established milestones that ensure the project remains on track. The success of the project will encourage a redirection of existing humanitarian aid, excite new donors, and provide a working model for local government support.

David Miliband, President and CEO of IRC, called the 100&Change grant “a transformational investment that will bring hope and opportunity to a generation of refugee children. This MacArthur grant will create a model for investment in early childhood services around the world. IRC’s partnership with Sesame is an incredible validation of our determination to put education center-stage in humanitarian settings. I hope the new kind of philanthropic thinking embodied by this grant will be an inspiration to others seeking to tackle the world’s largest problems. At a time when governments are in retreat, NGOs and philanthropists need to step up, and that is what we are seeing here – and in a big way.” 

The 100&Change finalists receiving grants of $15 million each over five years are:

- [Catholic Relief Services](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/catholic-relief-services/) – changing how society cares for children in orphanages; 

- [HarvestPlus](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/harvestplus/) – eliminating hidden hunger in Africa by fortifying staple crops; and 

- [Rice 360° Institute for Global Health (Rice University)](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/rice-360-institute-global-health-rice-university/) – improving newborn survival in Africa. 

“Collectively, these projects identify the opportunity for action to improve long-term prospects for the world’s children. They propose feasible and durable solutions to remediate the effects of family and community disruption, the lack of dietary diversity, and premature birth. All four projects proved worthy of MacArthur’s support,” said Cecilia Conrad, MacArthur’s Managing Director who leads 100&Change. “MacArthur is deeply committed to helping all of them attract the support their critical work requires and finding partners to realize these impactful solutions.”

To help draw attention to and support for the many strong proposals submitted to the competition, MacArthur partnered with Foundation Center to develop the [*100&Change* Solutions Bank](http://100andchange.foundationcenter.org/), a website where nonprofits can find collaborators and funders can search for projects in which to invest. The Solutions Bank is searchable by topics such as geography, subject, strategy, population served, sustainable development goal alignment, and linked research. MacArthur also supported the Center for High Impact Philanthropy (CHIP) at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy & Practice, which analyzed the [top 200](http://100andchange.org/#results/top200) scoring proposals using its lens of social impact. CHIP’s “[Bold Ideas for Philanthropists to Drive Social Change](https://www.impact.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CHIP1217_BoldIdeas_Final.pdf)” guide showcases 81 proposals that stood out for the clarity of their goal and the logic of their proposed solution. Eleven “best bets” were highlighted as having the greatest potential for impact. Third, MacArthur worked closely with [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5027), which identified *100&Change* participants that it rated with four stars, and shared its analysis with its broad audience of individual donors.

*100&Change* is a distinctive competition that invited proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location. There was [robust participation](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/update-100change-robust-participation/): 7,069 competition registrants submitted 1,904 proposals. Of those, 801 passed an initial [administrative review](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/update-100change-applications/) and were evaluated by a [panel of judges](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/panel-wise-heads/) who each provided ratings on [four criteria](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/100change-judging-criteria/): meaningfulness, verifiability, durability, and feasibility. MacArthur’s Board of Directors then selected [eight semi-finalists](http://www.macfound.org/8boldsolutions) and, later, four finalists.

*100&Change* was designed to be fair, open, and transparent. The [identity of the judges](https://www.100andchange.org/#judges) and the [methodology](https://www.100andchange.org/#scoring) used to assess initial proposals are public. Applicants received comments from the judges. Key issues in the competition are discussed in a [blog](https://www.macfound.org/programs/perspectives-100change/) on MacArthur’s website. A searchable [database](http://www.100andchange.org/#explore-submissions) of all the proposals is available online, and the [top 200](http://100andchange.org/#results/top200) scoring proposals are identified. 

Information about the next round of the 100&Change competition will be made available in late 2018.

2391114,"Cameroon Villages Burned After Separatist Attacks *Moki Edwin Kindzeka*

YAOUNDE — Several villages are said to have been set ablaze in Cameroon's English speaking southwestern town of Mamfe after armed separatists attacked military installations and killed four soldiers. The Cameroon government says it has seized three of the armed separatists' training camps.

Cameroon communication minister and government spokesperson Issa Tchiroma says for the past two weeks, military and armed separatist groups have been involved in bloody conflicts in the English speaking southwestern town of Mamfe on the border with Nigeria.

""Several suspects have been arrested, large quantities of war and hunting weapons as well as hundreds of military ammunition and uniforms have also been seized,"" Tchiroma said. ""One of those attacks has unfortunately claimed the lives of four of our gendarmes who were cold bloodedly killed this Monday December 18 in Kembong, Eyumojock sub division in Manyu division.""

Thchiroma refused to give the number of armed separatists killed by security forces in ensuing clashes, but disclosed that at least three border villages that hosted training camps for the fighters had been liberated.

Villagers say there has been an unprecedented harsh crackdown by the military, which also used helicopters to fire on civilians.

Kembong resident Victor Arrey Ndip says his village and two others have been completely destroyed by the fighting and many people are dying.

""They have bumped three villages so every body should be very careful with what is happening on the ground now,"" Ndip said. ""As I am telling you, people are dying in their numbers in Mamfe.""

Mamfe is a town in Manyu, an administrative area on Cameroon's border with Nigeria where Cameroon says some of the fighters are trained. It has a vast expanse of forests, which the government says favors guerilla warfare with hit and run tactics from armed separatists.

The violence has pushed thousands of Cameroonians across the border to Nigeria since early October, when the separatists said they had declared their independence.

Schools have been closed in most of the English speaking northwest and southwest regions since November last year, when lawyers and teachers protested the overuse of French in the bilingual country. Violence erupted when separatists joined and called for complete independence.

President Paul Biya has made it clear that he will not negotiate on separation, saying the country is indivisible.

When the separatists started attacking military positions, he declared war on them, describing the separatists as terrorists.",4592,"Education"

This regional appeal will ensure that the response to the food crises in Africa is effectively managed and coordinated beyond the country level, focusing on five key objectives: 

1. Provide strategic oversight, enhanced leadership at the regional level and ensure support to operations.

2. Promote approaches which increase households and community resilience and build sustainable solutions to food insecurity.

3. Facilitate and encourage regional learning and peer-to-peer support.

4. Support the collection, consolidation and effective use of monitoring and data and information.

5. Strengthen and scale up community engagement and accountability approaches and activities.    

This Emergency Appeal has been revised considering the adjusted geographic scope and evolving humanitarian needs in the Africa continent, as well as the human resource requirements of the regional coordination team. A funding gap of CHF 857,045 remains in this revised Emergency Appeal. The strategy has been informed by a continuous analysis of the emergency and operational conditions in the countries with food crises in Africa, and may be further adjusted based on the developments in 2018.

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)). In 2017, these conditions have led several countries to be on the brink of famine.",4592,"Education"

**The disaster and the Red Cross Red Crescent response to date**  

- 2016/2017: The African continent faces an unprecedented food crisis. Below-average rainfall due to El Nino and La Nina leads to poor crop harvests and limited availability of water. Conflict and violence further reduces the coping capacities of affected populations.  

- February 2017: The United Nations formally declares famine in parts of South Sudan, and reports severe food insecurity in Nigeria and Somalia.  

- April 2017: IFRC launches the Emergency Appeal for Regional Coordination of the Food Crisis in Africa to scale up and support actions in the most affected countries.

2390649,"The European Union donates an additional EUR 10.5 million to UNRWA at a crucial time for Palestine refugees The European Union (EU) has announced an additional, vital contribution of EUR 10.5 million to the 2017 Programme Budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), in support of education, access to health care, employment opportunities, and improved living conditions for millions of Palestine refugees.

This donation complements nearly five decades of steadfast EU support of Palestine refugees. This year, in particular, the European Union and UNRWA have launched the unique _Healthy Living, Healthy Spaces_ (HLHS) campaign, targeting 50 EU-sponsored UNRWA schools and 15 health centers for repair and rehabilitation across Lebanon, Gaza, West Bank and Jordan fields. Both [the HLHS initiative](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-and-eu-celebrate-launch-project-improve-unrwa-health-and-educational) and latest contribution stand as a testament to the strong EU and UNRWA partnership for Palestine refugees.

In recognition of the contribution, Pierre Krähenbühl, UNRWA Commissioner-General, stated: “Giving some half million students in UNRWA schools across the Middle East a sense of dignity and preserving their opportunities is particularly urgent at a time when the spaces in which they can develop and enjoy a normal childhood are shrinking so dramatically. This is particularly important in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in Gaza and in Syria. In these contexts, the support we receive from the EU is of critical significance.”

""With this contribution, the EU support to the regular UNRWA budget in 2017 has reached EUR 102 million. This support allows millions of Palestine refugees to receive access to education, health and other social services. These services are crucial for sustaining hope amid a tough reality,"" said EU Representative Ralph Tarraf. ""In its five fields of operations, UNRWA is contributing to stability in the face of enormous new challenges. The EU will continue to support this effort until a just and agreed-upon solution is found for Palestine refugees. This is an essential element of the EU strategy to maintain peace in the region,"" he added. 

The European Union is the Agency’s largest multi-lateral donor, with an overall yearly contribution amounting to 12.5 per cent of the total programme support. This latest donation brings the EU contributions to EUR 102 million for 2017, including EUR 82 million disbursed earlier in the year and the additional contribution of EUR 9.5 million announced this past September.

**EU AND UNRWA: TOGETHER FOR PALESTINE REFUGEES**

Since 1971, the European Union and UNRWA have maintained a strategic partnership governed by the shared objective to support the human development, humanitarian and protection needs of Palestine refugees and promote stability in the Middle East. Today, the European Union is the largest multilateral provider of international assistance to Palestine refugees. This reliable and predictable support from the European Union enables UNRWA to provide core services to more than 5 million Palestine refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, including quality education for roughly half a million children and primary health care for more than 3.5 million patients.

Collectively, the EU and its Member States are also among the largest contributors to the Agency’s humanitarian emergency appeals and projects in response to various crises and specific needs across the region. The partnership between the European Union and UNRWA has allowed millions of Palestine refugees to be better educated, live healthier lives, access employment opportunities and improve their living conditions, thus contributing to the development of the entire region.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. As a result, the UNRWA Programme Budget, which supports the delivery of core essential services, operates with a large shortfall. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

UNRWA is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees. Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight. UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection and microfinance.

Now in its ninth year, the crisis shows no sign of abating. Insecurity continues to pose major challenges in delivering assistance, especially with the dry season enabling an intensification of hostilities between the Nigerian armed forces and non-state armed groups. Additionally, about 926,000 people remain completely inaccessible to humanitarian organisations.

The bulletin is published on a quarterly basis highlighting trends and patterns in grave violations against children. 

Members of the working group include: B’Tselem, DCI-Palestine, OCHA, OHCHR, Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Terre Des Homme – Suisse, Save the Children, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNRWA, UNMAS, War Child Holland, WHO and World Vision. 

This edition covers October, November and December 2016. 

**Update as of September 2017:** The Principals of Working Group member organizations met in August 2017 and reaffirmed their commitment to continue to generate accurate and reliable data on the situation of children affected by the conflict In Israel and the State of Palestine and to put this data in the public domain for advocacy purposes and to improve the situation of children. They will continue to work to improve the content and format of the CAAC bulletins and implement specific actions to that end. They also agreed to move forward with a similar but distinct ‘bulletin approach’ on other non-conflict related child rights issues of concern in an effort to ensure a more comprehensive approach to the child rights agenda. They reaffirmed the need for engagement with all concerned parties. UNICEF, as the chair of the Working Group, is also in the process of reaching out to other human rights organizations who may be able to provide additional data on grave child rights violations and, where relevant, will propose their inclusion in the Working Group.

**MAJOR TRENDS & VIOLATIONS**

The situation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip remained tense in the fourth quarter of 2016. A total of 1,305 incidents were documented in the reporting period, affecting 10,831 children. This marks a sharp increase from the preceding quarter when 746 incidents affecting 3,291 children were reported. This is mainly due to a significant rise in the number of children affected by education-related incidents following the restart of the school year: 8,993 children compared to 1,693 in the third quarter, with 103 education-related incidents registered in the last quarter of 2016, compared to 25 in the third quarter.

The number of children killed as well as the number of those injured in the reporting period were both lower than they had been in each of the preceding quarters in 2016. During the fourth quarter, four Palestinian boys were killed, and 81 Palestinian children were injured (5 girls and 76 boys); no Israeli children were killed and four Israeli children (4 boys) were injured. During the third quarter, six Palestinian boys had been killed and 190 children (187 Palestinian and 3 Israeli) injured.  

Additionally, one health related incident was documented in the West Bank. Nine-hundred and eighteen (918) cases of denial and delayed access to health were documented in the Gaza Strip following the application of stricter criteria by Israeli authorities, compared to five-hundred and thirty four (534) cases in the third quarter. Restrictions of access imposed by the Egyptian authorities remain ongoing.  

Available data indicates that the number of Palestinian children held in detention on security grounds remained high and continued to include cases of administrative detention.",4592,"Education"
2390024,"North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, November 2017 **Operational Overview**

The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains severe due to ongoing conflict, continued internal displacement and the unpredictable return of refugees from neighbouring countries. New population movements continued to be recorded in November, with 1,862 new arrivals in Gwoza, followed by 729 in Askira/Uba, 428 in Mafa, 373 in Ngala and 358 in Madagali; Jere and Chibok recorded relatively high numbers of departures. Additionally, recent important and unexpected arrivals of population (over 13,000 persons) were recorded in Nganzai, Konduga and Magumeri where there is very limited partner presence due to insecurity and lack of access. Humanitarian agencies mobilised to address to the most urgent needs, in particular through the rapid response mechanism (RRM), filling the most pressing gaps until sectors can plan and deliver a comprehensive response.  

While food security has improved throughout the north-east in 2017 as a result of a massive scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihoods assistance, the situation remains extremely fragile with many households, particularly in Borno State, mainly dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic food and livelihood needs. Many remain forced to resort to negative coping strategies to access food. The most recent Cadre Harmonisé analysis (finalised in November) projects that, without adequate and timely humanitarian assistance, 3.7 million individuals will be facing critical levels of food insecurity during the 2018 lean season (June through September). The figure does not include four Borno State local government areas (LGAs) where data could not be collected due to access constraints (in Abadam, Guzamala and Marte) or lack of partner capacity (in Kala/Balge).  

In addition to food insecurity, issues of protection continue to cause extremely serious concern throughout the north-east, including person-borne explosive device attacks in or near IDP camps, and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of internally displaced persons (IDPs) by those supposed to protect them, as was reported in Bama (Borno State). In addition, on 1 November, four pupils in a primary school in Kwaya Kusar, Borno State, were gruesomely attacked. Two of them died and the other two were severely wounded. This direct attack against an educational institution, the first one in two years, may impact school attendance as parents may fear for their children’s lives. In addition, following the resurgence of attacks by non-state armed groups in some parts of Adamawa State, 12 primary schools have been closed, affecting education continuity for the children enrolled in those schools.  

The dry season has also allowed the work on ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs to accelerate and, to date, five out of the nine planned hubs are complete (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza). Another four (Monguno, Damasak, Banki and Rann) are expected to be fully operational by early 2018. As these hubs offer secure accommodation and Internet connectivity for aid workers, they are instrumental in supporting effective last-mile aid delivery and enhancing local coordination.  

With close to 70 per cent (US$731 million out of $1.05 billion) of the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) funding requirements received before year-end, the humanitarian response in Nigeria is one of the world’s best funded. Thanks to the generous support of donors, many sectors have been able to meet their targets on key life-saving activities. However, a critical gap remained throughout the year in the funding of the Response and Recovery Planning sector. This has hampered the humanitarian agencies’ ability to deliver comprehensive livelihood support to affected people, has slowed down debris removal activities in major towns, and overall limited early recovery work across north-east Nigeria.  

As the year draws to a close, sectors and humanitarian organisations continued to carry out various programme-based and areabased needs assessments which are contributing to drafting the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan, to be finalised respectively by mid-December and early January.",4592,"Education"

2389974,"Orphaned Rohingya children forced to grow up too fast *In Bangladesh, thousands of teenaged refugees are now caring for their younger siblings and relatives after losing their families in Myanmar violence.*

By Mohammed Abu Asaker in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh  |  22 December 2017

**At just 18, Rabiaa is newly orphaned and a “mother” of two.**

Her parents died when their village in Myanmar’s Buthidaung township was razed a few months ago. In the chaos, she was separated from her four siblings and found her two nieces, aged four and nine, in distress on the side of the road. They sought refuge in a local village for a month before crossing to Bangladesh.

“It was a tough journey,” said Rabiaa, recalling the 25-day walk with nothing but the clothes on their backs. “My nieces were crying the whole time, missing their parents and little brothers.”

They arrived at a transit centre run by UNHCR, a first stop for new arrivals in Bangladesh, and were given hot meals, clean water and new clothes. A week later, they moved to Kutupalong camp where they now live beside their former neighbour from Myanmar.

“Since we all lost our parents, I am now playing the role of a mother and they are like my little children,” said Rabiaa of the two girls. “I will take care of them for the rest of my life, even if it means that I don’t get married. I want to see them well-educated.”

Rabiaa’s predicament is sadly far too common in the refugee camps and settlements of Cox’s Bazar, where some 650,000 refugees have arrived after fleeing violence that erupted in Myanmar in late August.

The UN Refugee Agency believes that children make up 55 percent of the total refugee population. Thousands have fled without the protection of their family or community and become caregivers to younger siblings or other children overnight. According to the current family counting exercise, some 5,600 families are headed by children under 18 years of age.

Jainab Bibi, 14, is still mourning her mother’s death during the journey to Bangladesh two months ago. “We covered her body with a blanket and left,” she said, crying. “I miss her very much.”

As well as coping with that loss, she also has to care for her eight-year-old brother. Fortunately, they are now living with a former neighbour who was a good friend of their mother’s.

“We never think of children as lonely. But here, I met some of the loneliest children who now have to adopt an adult role taking care of their own siblings,” said Louise Aubin, UNHCR’s senior emergency coordinator in Cox’s Bazar.

UNHCR and partner organizations are identifying families headed by children, as well as children who are alone or unaccompanied, for individual follow-up to assess their situation.

UNHCR and others involved in child protection are setting up sustainable foster care arrangements within the refugee communities to ensure that these refugee children are safe and properly supported. More child-friendly spaces and education facilities are being established to help ease the pressures on children forced into adult roles.

These roles can be hard to shake off. Aisha has been playing “mum” since she was seven years old. Her parents died of tuberculosis in Myanmar 10 years ago, leaving her to care for three younger siblings. They fled to Bangladesh in October, where Aisha takes care of the shelter while her two brothers and a sister look for work, collect firewood or attend the madrassa, or Islamic school.

She frets that she cannot give them everything they need, and still imagines a life in which her parents are still alive – a life where she could marry and worry less about the little ones’ future.

But the daydream wears off as she remembers her responsibilities: “I want to make sure they are well educated. If they get high marks, I will feel like I raised them well.”

Arefullah, 18, is also doing his best to provide for his 16-year-old sister Mahbouba. They lost touch with their parents and four brothers during the violence back home, and do not know if they are alive or dead.

While Arefullah keeps checking in with community leaders on their whereabouts, he is moving ahead with his new life in Bangladesh. The teenager has opened a barber stall in Kutupalong camp: “I get four to five customers a day, making about 160 taka (US$2). It’s enough to buy food for my sister and me.”

**CONTEXT**

Pulchuol is a payam located in the center of the Uror County (Jonglei State). Uror borders with Motoot in the Northeast, Pathai in the West, and Karam and Pieri in the East. Pulchuol Payam includes the four bomas Duol, Rupliah, Patuak and Nyakhor, which were assessed during this DTM exercise.

Between the end of March and early April of this year, conflict took place in Yuai, displacing its population which moved towards Pulchuol. As conflict also took place in Waat, people avoided that area and stayed in Pulchuol or moved to other locations, such as Akobo and east of Waat.",4592,"Education"
2389589,"DTM South Sudan: Pathai Payam, Intentions Survey and Multi-Sectorial Needs Assessment | December 2017 **INTRODUCTION**

IOM and Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH – present for NFI assessment) reached Pathai on 25 October. The team was welcomed by the Relief Organization For South Sudan (ROSS) and met with the Acting Executive Director in the absence of the Deputy Commissioner. The assessment dates were 26 October in Pathai Centre, 27 October in Turgay, 28 October in Modit and 30 October in Pabuong.  

**CONTEXT**

Pathai is a payam in Urur County of Jonglei State. It is about 120 minutes’ flight by helicopter from Bor. The host population is estimated at 14,796. The area also hosts more than 6,390 IDPs that fled conflict and hunger in Ayod,  

Pajul, Chuil, Uleng, and some locations in and around Waat of the former Greater Jonglei State and most IDPs arrived in the area between January and June 2017 bringing the total populaঞon to 21,186 individuals. There have been no reported cases of new arrival of IDPs in Pathai Payam since June. Apart from small scale fishing and farming, pastoralism is the most commonly pracঞced livelihood amongst the small population. The situation of the most vulnerable people including IDPs is precarious, with most surviving on sharing food with the host community, lile fish from nearby swamps and food distribuঞons from WFP around July 2017.  

Health and education faciliঞes are lacking. Only few pupils aend school, with some children being involved in cale herding, whilst others have joined armed groups. Most of the populaঞon including IDPs fetch drinking water from boreholes and contaminated water sources including stagnant ponds. Poor sanitaঞon is further exacerbated by the lack of latrines and the populaঞon pracঞcing open defecaঞon. In Pathai Centre there is a mobile clinic operated by MSF which is accessible for the community four ঞmes a month. The clinic also covers the nearest bomas including Modit, Pabuong, Turgay and Pulchuol. In the absence of other health faciliঞes in Pathai people with healthcare needs are reported to use local herbs in consultaঞon with local healers.  

According to the County Acting Commissioner, the front line between Pathai and Waat is about 12 hours’ walk from Pathai. Instances of inter-clan conflicts, cale rustling and revenge killings are reported as security concerns in the region.",4592,"Education"

2389534,"Germany Contributes EUR 23.15 Million to UNRWA for Projects in Gaza 22 December 2017

On 8 and 13 December 2017, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) signed two agreements with the German Development Bank (KfW) totaling EUR 23.15 million from the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

As part of the overall contribution, EUR 18.15 million will be allocated to the UNRWA reconstruction programme in Gaza, allowing the safe and dignified return of some 540 Palestine refugee families to their houses that were completely destroyed during the hostilities in the summer of 2014. Reaffirming Germany’s strong commitment to support Palestinian refugees in Gaza, this grant builds on earlier contributions in the amount of EUR 57 Million by the German Federal Government towards the UNRWA emergency shelter and reconstruction programme since 2014.

An additional EUR 5 million will be used for the construction and expansion of two UNRWA schools in the Gaza Strip which will benefit around 6,000 students. Two schools will be constructed using the completely renewed, innovative, child-friendly UNRWA school design and will significantly enhance education for thousands of children over the coming years. In total, UNRWA operates 267 schools in Gaza, providing primary education to a steadily increasing student population of now over 262,000 refugee children.

The German Representative in Ramallah, Mr. Peter Beerwerth, welcomed the additional funding: “With this substantial contribution to the UNRWA reconstruction programme in Gaza, Germany is continuing its support to Palestine refugees. 540 families will be able to rebuild their completely destroyed houses.

As education is of utmost importance to Germany, we are contributing an additional EUR 5 million to UNRWA schools in Gaza. With this German support, thousands of students will profit from an enhanced and safer learning environment,” he added.

“We highly value this generous contribution and the commitment of the Federal Republic of Germany to support the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip and the work of UNRWA work which will bring the response to reconstruction needs resulting from the massive destruction caused in 2014 a significant step towards completion. We are also very much appreciate the support from the BMZ and the KfW to build schools that will enable us to continue to provide quality education for Palestine refugees’ children in Gaza,” stated Mr. Matthias Schmale, Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza.

These additional contributions further extend the significant support that the German Federal Government is rendering towards Palestine refugees in Gaza. Germany continues to support UNRWA in the fields of humanitarian assistance, employment creation, infrastructure, reconstruction and rehabilitation. The new contributions are implemented through the state-owned development bank KfW.

In 2016, Germany was the Agency’s fourth largest donor, having contributed EUR 67,534,343 (USD 73,627,810) to UNRWA. Germany has been a member of the UNRWA Advisory Commission since 2005.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**  
UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. As a result, the UNRWA Programme Budget, which supports the delivery of core essential services, operates with a large shortfall. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

UNRWA is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees. Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight. UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection and microfinance.",4592,"Education"

2389429,"Tambura Displacement Brief: Tambura County, Western Equatoria State, South Sudan, November 2017 **Background**

Following reports of returnee influx from the Central African Republic (CAR) to bordering areas in Western Equatoria State, REACH deployed as part of a multi-agency assessment to Tambura town, the border town of Source Yubu and surrounding areas to understand displacement patterns and access to services for newly arrived internally displaced person (IDP) and local communities. Tambura town was assessed on 8 November and Source Yubu was assessed on 9 November. REACH conducted five focus group discussions (FGDs) with newly arrived IDPs and members of the local community and two key informant interviews with Relief Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) officials. Eight settlements were furthermore assessed remotely through Key Informant (KI) interviews.

**Population Movement and Displacement**

The population of Tambura County has reportedly rapidly increased since the beginning of the year with reported influx of returnees from CAR as well as IDPs from neighbouring counties.

**Returns from CAR**

Since June 2017, high numbers of South Sudanese refugees started to come back from Obo Camp in southeastern CAR. The RRC recorded 6,212 returnees (1,517 households (HHs)) in Source Yubu and 16,699 IDPs/returnees (8,360 HHs) in Tambura,2 though no humanitarian organizations have been able to verify these numbers.  

The main challenge along the traveling route reported by the returning population was hunger. While able-bodied individuals reportedly took between 5 to 9 days to travel from Obo Camp to Source Yubu and another 3 to 5 days to reach Tambura town, those traveling with young children took much longer, often several weeks.  

FGD participants reported that the returns were primarily motivated by a lack of food inside the camp, where food distributions stopped around June due to insecurity along the supply route.3 Refugees in Obo Camp were reportedly not allowed to access land for cultivation and were therefore completely dependent on food assistance. Another reported reason for return was the fear of conflict, which is currently affecting CAR.

FGD participants reported that Obo Camp mainly hosted refugees from Source Yubu, which fled South Sudan following conflict which began in 2015. The most recent clashes in Source Yubu took place around November 2016 when most of the population was displaced to Bambouti, a town located approximately 5 km west of the border inside of CAR, from where they were transferred to Obo Camp earlier in the year. Other refugees in Obo Camp were reportedly from Ezo,  
Tambura and Nagero Counties, suggesting that small numbers of refugees might also be returning to those areas.

The vast majority of the returnees are originally from Source Yubu.  
Some of the returnees were able to settle again in their former communities in Source Yubu. A substantial proportion, however, reportedly found their houses destroyed or occupied by armed actors upon return and decided to move on towards Tambura town.  
Returnees/IDPs are scattered in and around Tambura town where they have settled with the local communities.

**Displacement from Bazia Road, Wau County**

Between February and April 2017, heavy clashes displaced populations living along the Bazia road in Western Bahr el Ghazal towards Jur River County and Farajallah village, Wau County. A smaller number reportedly fled south to Nagero and Tambura Counties. According to recent reports, 700 IDPs have settled in Nagero town,5 while the RRC in Tambura town recorded another 300 HHs which reportedly arrived between February and May 2017.

**Displacement from Nadiangare village, Yambio County**

According to the RRC in Tambura town, approximately, 1,980 IDPs (325 HHs) have reportedly arrived between December 2016 and February 2017 from Nadiangare Village in Yambio County. Most of these IDPs have reportedly settled 10 km outside of Tambura town in Seneguse settlement (Mupoi Payam), after initial displacement from Nadiangare village due to heavy clashes.

**Displacement from Ezo town, Ezo County**

Frequent clashes between 2015 and 2017 displaced people from Ezo town and outskirts towards Tambura town and surroundings, while others fled across the border to refugee camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There are no official estimate numbers of IDPs from Ezo. However, FGD participants estimated around 2,000-3,000 individuals, some of whom have reportedly returned to Ezo town and surroundings.

**Refugees from Central African Republic**

Reports shared by the Refugee Commission Affairs of 119 newly arrived refugees (22 HHs) from CAR could not be confirmed during the mission to Tambura. The RRC had reportedly no information about recent arrivals and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) could only verify nine newly arrived refugees from CAR. UNHCR had registered 812 refugees (250 HHs) that had fled intensive conflict between 2009 and 2012. Those refugees have settled within the Tambura community and were therefore reportedly not interested in relocation to refugee camps.",4592,"Education"
2389334,"UNMISS Quick Impact Project helps boost education The gifting of two new classrooms and an office by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan to a secondary school in Gogrial will help boost educational opportunities for children in the area.

The Quick Impact Project at the Karic Secondary School in Kuac, carried out by UNMISS in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Development Agency (FADA), involved construction of the classrooms as well as the gifting of 75 desks and chairs.

Following the handover, the State Minister of Education, Science and Technology, Malek Madut Makom,  said it was a big achievement to have a secondary school in the area.

“This facility will help our children to continue learning after completing primary school,” he said. “Students used to travel to Wau or Kuajok for their secondary education but with the help of UNMISS, our students will no longer be going far for their secondary school education.” 

The Minister thanked UNMISS and FADA for their contribution and encouraged communities to take their children to school and to maintain the school facility.

UNMISS acting Head of Field Office in Kuajok, Abimbola Aina, urged the local community to embrace peace and enable children to go to school without fear.

2389319,"Assessment of the economic impact of investment in disaster risk reduction and prevention: The case of Tabasco This study assesses the role of the investments made in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and prevention in the actual reduction of the impact of floods in the state of Tabasco between 2007 and 2010. Based on a previous study conducted within the framework of the Technical Assistance Agreement between the Mexican Government and the World Bank, it was found that the intense rainfall events occurring in Tabasco in 2007 and 2010 were similar in terms of their hydrometeorological characteristics (rainfall) and spatial distribution (rainfall fields). When analyzing the accumulated rainfall recorded for both events, it was found that the magnitude of the 2010 floods was greater than that of the 2007 floods.

However, damages and losses estimations recorded by the National Center for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) show an 80 percent reduction in 2010, compared to 2007 (World Bank, 2014). The similarity between these two events provides an ideal “natural experiment” scenario to evaluate the benefits of the investments in DRR made between 2008 and 2010.

Motivated by the devastating floods that occurred in October 2007, the Mexican Federal Government, together with the Government of the State of Tabasco, designed the Comprehensive Water Plan of Tabasco (PHIT, Plan Hídrico Integral de Tabasco) and began its implementation. The aim of the PHIT was to come up with a set of solutions that guaranteed the population’s safety, as well as the performance and continuity of economic activities and the balance of ecosystems in the occurrence of floods. The PHIT provides for the implementation of structural measures (physical investments, such as embankments and reinforcements) and non-structural measures (non-engineering measures, such as workshops, trainings, development of early warning systems and drawing of risk maps, among others).

The aim of this analysis is to assess the impact caused by the floods and the investments in DRR on the socioeconomic wellbeing of the population of Tabasco. For that purpose, estimations were made of the impact on the school dropout rate for Basic Education students (primary and secondary levels), and of the effect onthe economic activity of the state (measured through changes in the intensity of nighttime lights [or NTL]). On the one hand, the results show that the fluvial flooding level (GLOFRIS) indeed has a negative effect on the level of school dropout and on the changes in NTL. On the other hand, no robust results were found for the effect of the investments in DRR, even after correctinga possible bias resulting from their location. conclusion, the results obtained in this studyreinforce those found in the previous one (World Bank, 2014): the impact of the 2007 floods was greater than that of the 2010 floods, even though the latter year was characterized by rainfall events of a greater magnitude.",4592,"Education"
2389234,"Chad: Socioeconomic profiling of Sudanese, Central African et Nigerian refugees **1- Background and rationale**

Chad has been welcoming Sudanese refugees fleeing violence in the Darfur region for more than 10 years. Security and political conditions are still not conducive to a return to their home country.  
At the same time, overall insecurity prevails in Central African Republic impeding the repatriation of thousands of C.A.R. refugees and returnees living in Southern Chad. The prolonged presence of refugees in Chad and the continuous reduction in available funding for food and non-food assistance, have led the humanitarian community to reconsider the type of interventions in place. Between 2014 and 2015, WFP and UNHCR conducted a socio-economic categorization in refugee camps in Southern and South-eastern parts of the country with the strong involvement of CNARR (Government agency for refugees and returnees). Based on lessons learned from that approach, the 2016 Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) recommended an update in 2017. The current exercise was designed to go beyond a simple categorization and thus identify refugee household that can be empowered in the short to medium term as well as factors that can enable self-reliance. The results of profiling should be used to develop a new strategic needs-based approach. During the exercise, the technical teams decided to include in the analysis Nigerian and Central Africans refugees who arrived more recently but who may eventually face the same difficulties. 

**2- Key figures**

- Initial data collection was conducted between 17 June and 15 July 2017. An additional round for Central African refugees installed in host villages in southern Chad was organized from 25 July to 4 August 2017.

- 544 officers including 435 interviewers ensured data collection; supervision and data quality check was provided by the staff of CNARR, UNHCR and WFP;.

- 19 camps and 9 host villages were visited by data collection teams.

- 87,725 households were interviewed using the socio-economic questionnaire.

- 18 checklists were filled with programme officers, cooperating partners, local authorities and managers of basic services in camps.

- 30 focus groups (30 more to be received) were prepared with refugee leaders and representatives of women and youth.

- Individual information was collected from 356 684 persons.

- Data collection was done using smartphones (no trees were felled to support this operation).",4592,"Education"

• Other drought-affected areas are no longer in crisis: In some other Arid and Semi-arid lands (ASAL) areas, particularly in the northwest and in parts of the coast, conditions have returned to normal following significant off-season rainfall in recent months. However, in all ASAL counties, staple food prices remain well above normal, at a time when market dependence is high in the wake of successive poor seasons.

• Acute malnutrition: World Vision continues to respond to child malnutrition, with more than 420,000 children and nearly 37,000 pregnant and lactating women requiring treatment for acute malnutrition across the country.  Many areas continue to have Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates over the emergency threshold of 15 per cent.

• Presidential election: The country’s security situation has returned to normal after a volatile few months. Violence spiked in November in many informal settlements in Nairobi and Kisumu following the repeat presidential election held on the 26th October 2017, which was boycotted by the main opposition party.

• Access to health care services: After 150 days, the nurses’ national strike which begun in June was called off by the nurses’ union in November 2017. Nurses were ordered to resume their duties and restore health services across the country.  The strike negatively affected maternal and child health along with,  HIV and nutrition services.

2389064,"From artisanal mines to school : Akil’s moving testimony Child labour in artisanal mines and quarries in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains a major challenge. The Congolese government has committed to eradicating child labour but resources are limited to tackle a problem of this scale. No quantitative study has yet provided precise numbers of children involved, but estimates made in 2012 put the number of children working in artisanal mines at around 40,000, a large proportion of whom can be found in the copper belt of Haut-Katanga and in Lualaba Province.

The village of Luisha in Kambove territory, Haut-Katanga Province, is one of these regions where children can be found in artisanal mines. They constitute a cheap and easily exploitable workforce. Their size allows them to go down into those pits which are harder for adults to access. They also undertake the washing, sorting and transport of the minerals. This situation is a flagrant violation of international conventions on the protection of children as well as national laws.

**What Akim brought home to his family made a big difference**

Akim* is the eldest in his family. He admits to having started working in the artisanal mines due to his family’s financial situation. His parents also work in the mines, but their income is not sufficient to put food on the table for a large family with 5 children, and still less to meet their health and educational requirements.

What Akim brought home to his family therefore made a big difference to the family’s diet, even if it was far from enough to send his brothers and sisters to school. So, he set out bravely to the mines every day and worked as hard as he could to bring something home.

He was frequently ill but was always able to recover sufficiently to continue his work in the mines. He was also witness on numerous occasions to injuries suffered by colleagues of his age, who were working in the mines for the same reasons as him. Akim was soon afforded practically the same privileges as the adults, which deprived him of his right to a childhood.

**A future still accessible**

Akim still had dreams, however. He hoped to return to school  and become a doctor ! Thanks to the UNICEF’s intervention, Akim seems to be getting closer to his dream : he left the mines and is enrolled in a community school.

To ensure that his education would continue long term, his parents were invited to join other parents in forming associations which would work in concert with the Community Child Protection Network (RECOPE). They grow maize and undertake market gardening on 3 of the 100 hectares of ground provided to them by local authorities.

Thanks to this, Akim’s parents have been able to continue paying his school fees, and also enrol the other children in school ! They are still working in the artisanal mines, but are happy that their children are able to escape what they describe as hellish work.

Akim is extremely happy but is troubled to know that lots of his young compatriots are still in the mines in Luisha . He asks for the intervention of the Government, of significant figures in civil society and of the mining companies, so that the children of Luisha can quit the mines and go to school !

*Description of the disaster*

Sri Lanka has been facing an unprecedented outbreak of Dengue fever. Sri Lanka is a tropical country with two monsoon seasons. With each monsoon brings in two peaks of Dengue fever making it an endemic disease in Sri Lanka. However, 2017 started with an exceptionally high number of Dengue cases which shot up to an outbreak in May-June 2017, creating the largest Dengue outbreak experienced by the country for last three decades.

During the last 11 months of 2017, a total of 174,889 suspected Dengue cases have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Sri Lanka with over 320 deaths.  
Approximately 41.93 per cent of Dengue cases were reported from the Western province. The highest numbers of Dengue cases were reported during the 29th week of 2017. All four Virus types of Dengue have been seen in Sri Lanka. The current outbreak is predominantly due to Dengue Fever Virus Type 2 (DEN-2), which is not the usual type circulating in Sri Lanka. According to the WHO, this is a 4.3-fold higher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016. 

Monthly reported Dengue cases are varied depending on the rains received. In July 2017 the highest number of Dengue cases was reported where 23 per cent of the total Dengue cases reported.  
Presently it can be seen that there is a reduction in Dengue cases reported; 5 per cent in the month of November 2017.

It is expected that the country will face another outbreak after the monsoon rains in months of January and February 2018. However, Dengue cases are emerging in districts where the present outbreak was not previously reported. Historical data shows that there are always two peaks of Dengue incidence in Sri Lanka. One during Southwest monsoons and another during Northeast monsoons. Analysis of the data on the present outbreak shows the incidence of Dengue is getting higher in eastern province and districts adjoining to western province. Especially with the commencement of the North-Eastern monsoons, there is a risk of Dengue outbreaks in more districts. The MoH had requested from SLRCS with a second letter dated 11 September 2017 to scale up the activities at community level.

Since the schools have been considered as a hot spot for Dengue in Sri Lanka and are closed in the month of December. Considering there is trend of outbreak in January and February, SLRCS requested for one month extension till 28 February 2018, to allow sufficient time to complete the school awareness activities and to conduct public awareness public education (PAPE) on Dengue prevention via mainstream media. The plan of action is attached at the end of this DREF operation update.",4592,"Education"

UNICEF Appeal 2017 **US$ 146.9 million** *Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC), does not include inaccessible areas of Borno 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**   

The IOM DTM Round XIX (October 2017) estimates that a total of 1.57 million people remain internally displaced across the three northeast states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 85 per cent are in Borno alone. This represents a decrease of about 3 per cent as compared to Round XVIII (August 2017). The reduction is explained by the movement of people to the newly accessible areas in Borno State. Children represent 56 per cent of the total IDP population.  
During the reporting period, a total of 2,641 new arrivals were registered in 16 LGAs in Borno and 4 LGAs in Adamawa (IOM DTM ETT Report: No. 39; No.40). These ongoing arrivals are increasing the pressure on the delivery of humanitarian services in the IDP settlements in terms of shelter, health and nutrition, provision of food and access to sanitation. With the upcoming dry season and improved road access, it is expected that hostilities will intensify leading to increased population displacement.  
The number of cholera cases continued to decrease during the reporting period and as of 15th November 2017, the total number of confirmed and suspected cholera cases reached 5,340, with 61 deaths (CFR = 1.1 per cent): 2,686 cases in the Muna corridor (Jere LGA); 1,758 cases in Monguno and 82 cases in Guzamala. The total number of cases reported from Dikwa, MMC and Mafa stand at 736, 58 and 20 respectively and have remained so for over 3 weeks. Despite this improvement, active case finding and cholera prevention activities by UNICEF and partners continue in all the identified hotspots.",4592,"Education"
2388279,"UNICEF Syria Crisis Situation Report (Humanitarian Results) - November 2017 **Highlights**

- As of 18 December 2017, the UNICEF 2017/18 winter response in Syria and Syrian refugee host countries reached over 630,000 children but remains 58% underfunded (out of US$72 million appeal) and 880,000 children remain in dire need for support.

- In Syria, the escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta and limited access of humanitarian deliveries and commercial goods has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, half of them children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since January 2017. In the same month, UNICEF reached more than 340,000 people in hard-to-reach locations (including 27,000 people in besieged locations) with life-saving interventions and critical services in the areas of WASH, education, health and nutrition and child protection.

- In November in Turkey, over 167,000 Syrian refugee children benefitted from the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education (CCTE) for attending school regularly in preceding months, a nearly 22% increase in beneficiaries over the previous payment in September. Approximately 82% of children receiving the CCTE in November also benefitted from the Emergency Social Safety Net programme, which helped reach close to 1.1 million refugees to date.

- In Lebanon, UNICEF WASH response to 190,000 people living in informal settlements (population of 272,000) is facing a critical funding shortage of US$ 26.5 million to sustain services beyond April 2018. To pre-empt the funding shortfall, a shift from full service coverage is being undertaken to mainly focus on the most vulnerable, semi-temporary costeffective water and wastewater facilities, and the establishment of a surveillance mechanism to identify possible communicable disease outbreak and trigger an immediate Health and WASH joint response.

- The number of unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) in Egypt has increased to nearly 2,500 in 2017 compared to 1,800 last year including some Syrian refugees. Key needs identified for this highly vulnerable group include legal documentation, legal support, cash assistance, education and child protection services. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs:** Humanitarian needs remained critical in Syria throughout November. Though the overall level of violence decreased in some areas of the country (primarily those linked to de-escalation zones in southern Syria, northern Homs), violence escalated and or remained high elsewhere such as in Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Raqqa and Deir-Ez-Zour where fighting and anti-ISIL operations continue to inflict high civilian casualties. The escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta along with limited access of humanitarian and commercial shipments has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, especially children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since the last survey conducted in January 20171 . 

Furthermore, fighting between armed opposition groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Nour al-Din al-Zenki (NDZ) led to the disruption of humanitarian services in western rural Aleppo. Some humanitarian services were suspended from November 14 to 18 over concerns for the security of staff. Clashes between non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and the Government of Syria resulted in shelling in southern rural Aleppo, triggering a displacement of more than 10,000 residents and 2,600 internally displaced people (IDPs)2 . 

A rise in military clashes led to a displacement of more than 90,000 IDPs from As-Saan, Hamra and Oqierbat in Hama governorate and Tamanah in southern Idleb to move northward into Idleb governorate in the past two months.3 In Raqqa, displaced populations are returning to areas with a high prevalence of unexploded ordinances and landmines. Humanitarian partners estimate more than 200 related trauma cases since cessation of military activities in Raqqa City, particularly among children, highlighting the importance of scalingup life-saving mine risk education in prior active conflict zones. The destruction of education and health4 infrastructure along with further attacks and internal displacement continues to limit access to these essential services for children throughout the country. Subsequently, an estimated 1.7 million children remain out-of-school and 200,000 others have missed-out on basic immunization and polio. 

In total, Jordan now hosts 2.7 million refugees, including 655,588 registered Syrian refugees (51 per cent children)5 . A population of approximately 40,000 Syrians remain along Jordan’s northeast desert border near Rukban, of whom 80 per cent are estimated to be women and children, with a significant percentage of households headed by females. Since the closure of the border in June 2016, only modest support has been possible from the Jordanian side of the berm, including the provision of safe water and access to basic health services, primarily through the UN and in close coordination with the Jordanian Armed Forces. The UNICEF-supported clinic near Rukban has provided around 500 medical consultations in November, a decrease from services provided in the previous month (1,002 consultations) due to limited access. The daily provision of safe water by UNICEF and access to some health services remain the only regular humanitarian assistance available for the vulnerable population at the Berm. 

Reports of minor clashes between Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) armed forces (Peshmerga), Iraq Security Forces (ISF) and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) continued in the reporting month, albeit no significant displacement. As in the previous month, armed conflict remained largely far from Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) areas where Syrian refugees reside. There has been no resolution to ongoing political tension between the KRG in Erbil and the federal Government of Iraq since the referendum on the former’s independence in September, however political dialogue is ongoing. As of November, Iraq is hosting 246,974 registered Syrian refugees including over 107,187 children 6 . Although overall numbers have remained largely static, movements continue between Syria and Iraq at the Peshkhabour border crossing. Per information received from border authorities, some 5,100 Syrians arrived in the KRI in September alone, of these, more than 3,800 were readmittances after prior authorization by border authorities to return to Syria.7 The humanitarian situation of Syrian refugees in Iraq has remained largely the same throughout 2017. With around 40 per cent of Syrian refugees under 18, the need for access to formal education remains high. Although Syrian refugees in camps remain well served, Syrian refugees in host communities may not have regular access to primary healthcare, regular safe water supply or adequate sanitation. In this prolonged refugee crisis, there is need to identify and strengthen community-based child protection networks to identify child protection issues and advocate for child-focused solutions. 

Lebanon continues to host an estimated 1.5 million refugees (over one million registered with UNHCR8 ). The sudden resignation of the Prime Minister Saad Hariri on 4 November heightened the sense of an impending crisis. While the situation normalized with his return to Lebanon, the incident exposed a precarious political context and its potential impact on the region. UNICEF continues to face critical funding shortages in Informal Settlements (US$26.5 million gap) to meet the needs of 190,000 people (estimated population of 272,000) for WASH as well as for Health (US$ 2.8 million gap). Given the expected decrease in humanitarian funding next year, UNICEF is transitioning towards strategic and longer-term systems strengthening in the areas of the No Lost Generation initiatives (child protection, youth, education and social protection) as well as child survival (health and WASH), while maintaining a more durable humanitarian response in light of ongoing needs and current instability.  
In November, nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, including over 1.5 million children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.9 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, 2,052 refugees and migrants were rescued or apprehended on their sea journey from Turkey to Greece, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece. Under the framework of the EU-Turkey Statement, seven rounds of returns took place for 75 people in November (including two accompanied children)10, bringing the total number of readmissions to 1,469 since the Statement came into effect in March 2016. 

In Egypt, the total number of registered Syrian refugees and asylum seekers has reached over 124,000, an increase from the 117,591 registered in January 2017. Forty per cent of new Syrian arrivals are coming illegally from the Sudanese border leading to an increased number of detentions. UNICEF has access to the 23 detention centres where it provides health assistance, including vaccines, hygiene kits and non-food items, with a focus on young and adolescent girls. 

The Government of Egypt grants Syrian refugee children access to education in public schools under the same rules and regulations that apply to Egyptian nationals. However, absorbing the number of Syrian students in public schools is a persistent constraint due to high class density and limited number of teachers relative to students. Other challenges to enrolment include strict documentation requirements, safety measures (inside and outside classrooms) and lack of quality teaching in public schools. Currently, an estimated 39,000 children remain out-of-school. The number of unaccompanied and separated children has increased to about 2,50011 compared to 1,800 last year. Key needs include issuance of legal documentation to help qualify for legal support and cash assistance, in addition to education, child protection services.",4592,"Education"

- Between April-November, UNICEF and NGO partner ASAM distributed almost 41,800 protection vouchers to more than 18,800 vulnerable refugee families in six provinces, benefitting over 57,700 children.

- UNICEF provided support to the Ministry of Health for a third vaccination campaign for refugee and migrant children under five. Over 376,000 children were screened in 20 provinces, 117,000 of whom were found to have missed doses and vaccinated accordingly.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

In November, the number of registered refugees and asylum seekers in Turkey stood at over 3.7 million. Nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, of which 1.5 million are children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.

Meanwhile, over 3,200 refugees and migrants successfully journeyed by sea from Turkey to Greece in November, a 22% decrease compared to October. An estimated 35% of those who crossed are believed to be children.2 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, an additional 2,052 people were rescued or apprehended, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece.  

Under the framework of the EU-Turkey Statement, seven rounds of returns took place for 75 people (including two accompanied children)3 , bringing the total number of re-admissions to 1,469 since the Statement came into effect in March 2016.

Resolution 2332 [formerly 2258 (2015), 2165 (2014) and 2191 (2014)] authorizes UN agencies and their partners to use routes across conflict lines and the border crossings at Bab al-Salam, Bab al-Hawa, Al Yarubiyah and Al-Ramtha, to deliver humanitarian assistance to the people in need in Syria. The Government of Syria is notified in advance of each shipment and a UN Monitoring Mechanism oversees and confirms the humanitarian nature of consignments.

2387474,"Mali - Humanitarian Brief (December 2017) More than five years after the escalation of conflict in northern Mali, progress has stagnated and new momentum is required to avoid a significant setback in Mali's recovery. The signature of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in 2015 opened a unique window of opportunity, but the Malian peace process has fallen short of expectations as implementation of the agreement remains delayed. Communities whose lives were shattered by the conflict have not yet seen tangible progress and remain highly vulnerable.

**INCREASING HUMANITARIAN NEEDS**

In 2017, the resurgence of intercommunal violence and clashes between armed groups triggered displacements and disrupted the livelihoods of thousands of families. Several communities affected by the conflict still struggle to access food, water, healthcare, education, protection and livelihood opportunities. In some areas, the persisting insecurity continues to prevent the deployment of State and development actors. For many families, humanitarian actors are the sole providers of essential services. The conflict has further exacerbated the vulnerability of communities, whose capacity to withstand shocks has been eroded by repetitive droughts, foods, epidemics and chronic poverty. Mali ranks 175 out of 188 countries in the Human Development Index.  

Emergency aid remains necessary to save lives and facilitate recovery. Government and development partners' efforts to address the root causes of chronic food insecurity, malnutrition and structural problems in the delivery of basic services will take years to demonstrate tangible results.  

In 2018, 4.1 million people, representing 22% of the Malian population, will be food insecure (up from 3.8 million in 2017), including 800,000 people who will require urgent food assistance.  
Malnutrition remains a serious concern, with 165,000 children projected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, and 115,000 pregnant or lactating women requiring nutrition assistance. In Mali, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 10.7% and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) rate of 2.6% exceed the emergency thresholds established by the World Health Organization of 10% and 2% for GAM and SAM, respectively.  

In addition, 908,000 million Malians, largely in northern regions, need water, sanitation and hygiene assistance. Lack of access to potable water constitutes a risk for conflict, as communities compete for limited water resources for themselves, but also for livestock and agricultural activities.  

About 500 schools (up from 300 during the same period last year) remain closed in central and northern Mali, and 2,700 teachers have not returned or been deployed to their posts due to insecurity and the influence of extremist groups opposing education. Central Mali is particularly affected with 277 schools closed in the Mopti region.  

Non-functional schools will affect the education of 300,000 children. Out of school children that cannot reintegrate the education system are exposed to higher recruitment risks by non-state armed actors and criminal groups. In particular, girls remain at higher risk of exposure to violence in the absence of access to education.",4592,"Education"

**Operational Update**

UNHCR is bracing for further displacement and a spike in humanitarian needs as hostilities intensify in frontline areas on Yemen’s west coast. This follows the recent fighting in the capital, Sana’a, and neighbouring northern governorates. Over the past number of days, UNHCR has received reports of new displacement from Hudaydah and Taizz Governorates. UNHCR and partners are still assessing the situation, but initial reports are that more than 1,400 people have fled from Taizz and Hudaydah to locations in Southern Taizz and Lahj. With numbers expected to rise further, UNHCR is working with partners to support and help those fleeing, with emergency relief items for 2,000 families in Hudaydah, and a further 2,000 aid kits are on their way along with 2,000 emergency shelter kits.  

Meanwhile, following recent clashes, the situation in Sana’a has returned to relative calm, with UN humanitarian flights resuming a reduced service. UNHCR offices in Sana'a reopened as of this week with a core team of international staff, and is working with partners to resume humanitarian operations that were put on hold due to insecurity in early December. As a matter of urgency, UNHCR is restoring services where possible and resuming assistance for the most vulnerable IDP and refugee families, particularly a winter cash assistance programme aimed at 17,000 families.  

On 17 December, humanitarian organizations in Yemen issued a statement emphasizing neutrality and condemning any allegations of corruption and bias in the provision of relief assistance by parties to the conflict. UNHCR continues to work to serve the growing needs of those in Yemen and advocates for a political solution to put an end to the suffering.  

In Aden on 10 December, following repeated delays caused by difficulties in receiving clearance, the fourth Assisted Spontaneous Return (ASR) departure took place. A total of 108 returnees arrived safely in Berbera port in Somalia on 11 December, supported with return cash grants to assist their reintegration. On 18 December, a fifth movement took place.

2393449,"UNICEF official calls 2017 ‘horrible’ for children in Yemen 26 December 2017 – Children in Yemen could not have a worse year than 2017, according to a senior official from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

“2017 was a horrible year for the children of Yemen,” UNICEF Representative in the country, Meritxell Relaño, told UN News by telephone from the capital, Sana’a.

More than 80 children were killed or injured in December alone, while millions face a cholera epidemic, looming famine, a disruption in health services and a blockade hampering delivery of much-needed supplies.

She urged a political solution for what she said was a man-made conflict and warned that without a political solution many more children would die.

Ms. Relaño recounted meeting a woman and her dying 7-year-old son Ali in a hospital in Aden.

“He was like skin on bones. I asked why they had not come sooner and the mother told me that she could not afford to ride the bus to the hospital. The levels of poverty in the families [have] now reached levels that are unsustainable,” she said.

To offset some of this type of need, Ms. Relaño noted that some 1.3 million families, or about 8 million people, are being reached with emergency cash as part of a transfer project between UNICEF and the World Bank.

She also praised successful efforts to deliver vaccines and implement a polio immunization campaign this year to benefit some 5 million children and provide treatment for 200,000 children with acute malnutrition.

“Yemenis who work on the ground to support the Yemenis are the true heroes,” she said, noting the efforts of local authorities, doctors, nurses and teachers in the country.

Between January and October 2017 over 100.000 Venezuelan nationals have entered Peru through the northern entry point in Tumbes, according to authorities.

In Brazil 15,645 Venezuelans have lodged asylum claims in 2017, 1,680 Temporary Residence Permits have been granted and a total of 30,000 are estimated to live in the country.

**POPULATION OF CONCERN** 

- In November the movements from Venezuela to Colombia continued to grow, according to government figures that show net arrivals from Venezuelans reached 4,000 people per day (up from 3,500 in October), and 2,500 Colombian returnees per day. Colombian authorities also reported that some 200,000 have crossed into Ecuador. 

- Over 1 million Venezuelans have now registered for the Border Mobility Card (TMF) in Colombia. 

- In Peru 19,000 Venezuelans have applied for the Temporary Permanence Permit (PTP), Peruvian authorities estimate. Since August 4,000 PTPs have been issued out of that total. 

- At least 60,000 Venezuelans are estimated to be residing in the Southern Caribbean. 

- In Brazil some 15,000 of all Venezuelan asylum-claims have been lodged in Roraima border state since 2014, 2,500 in Amazonas state and some 590 in Sao Paulo.

**CONTEXT INFORMATION**

Over one million Venezuelans have left their country, according to host Government figures. Over 106,000 have sought asylum since 2014, more than half in 2017. Some 190,000 have also applied for alternative legal status across the region. They claim they are leaving for a variety of reasons, including threats by armed groups; fear of being targeted on account of their political opinion, real or perceived; insecurity and violence; lack of food, medicine and access to essential social services, as well as loss of income.

UNHCR has also identified hundreds of indigenous people crossing the borders, primarily into Colombia and Brazil. These groups sometimes travel long distances by land and have shown to be highly vulnerable as they do not have the financial resources to buy food or shelter. Additional support has been provided to them.

While the dialogue between the Government and the opposition coalition has restarted in the Dominican Republic, people continue to steadily leave the country. The socio-economic situation increasingly deteriorates and inflation has made it extremely difficult to access food, medicine, basic products and services. Reports from international organizations state that there is a considerable number of people with chronic malnutrition in the country, as well as a shortage of medicine. As a result of the strained resources, insecurity has also been increasing and having a rising impact on peoples’ lives.

**Operational Context**

**Brazil**

- The Government of Roraima has declared a state of social emergency due to the “intense, unlimited and disorderly flow of Venezuelans without means or conditions to sustain themselves” that arrive from Venezuela. Local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to provide an adequate security and health response, as well as to implement the recent government resolution that establishes standard operation procedures for the protection of unaccompanied and separated children, based on the recommendations by UNHCR.

- Among the reasons given by the Warao for leaving Venezuela, is that the government’s support to indigenous communities in the country has ceased. They claim that there are no available schools, health centres or services. Water distribution, usually their only source of potable water, has allegedly also stopped. The Warao also stated that they suffered discrimination in the access to ID- documents, which could help explain the considerable amount of Warao without identification arriving in Brazil.

- The Warao continue to move inward, confirming their intent to stay. Over 200 Warao are living in Pará state. The majority is living on the streets, while some 70 people are staying in a rural school set up as a temporary shelter by the Municipality. Following UNHCR’s counsel, Amazonas and Pará authorities created a formal communication channel to exchange experiences and lessons learned.

**Colombia**

- Armed groups activities at the Colombian-Venezuela border, incursions by the Venezuelan military into Colombia, confrontations between governments and the lack of capacity to control the actions of armed actors on both sides of the border are increasing risks for persons of concern in these areas. UNHCR continues to monitor the reports of violence at the border.

- In October, a pamphlet was distributed in Arauca by the “Araucan Social Cleansing Group”, accusing Venezuelan men of selling drugs to children and committing crimes and Venezuelan women of being prostitutes, and called for them to go back to Venezuela or face assassination.

- Colombian authorities are concerned about the spread of diseases including malaria, measles, diphtheria and tuberculosis in reception areas. They state that due to a lack of health access in Venezuela, arrivals are boosting transmission rates. More than 19,000 Venezuelans have received emergency treatment in Colombia, increasing pressure on local services. The Government is working with the Red Cross and WHO/PAHO to increase services, and UNHCR is advocating to ensure a protection-sensitive approach.

- The Special Stay Permit (PEP) application deadline expired on 31 October. Over 67,000 Venezuelans applied for the permit, which allows them to regularize their status, work and access basic services for up to two years in Colombia. UNHCR is advocating for this measure to be extended to ensure that legal pathways remain open, as is the case in other countries in the region.",4593,"Food and Nutrition"

2393399,"Philippine Red Cross appeals for aid for 500,000 people affected by ‘Vinta’ The Philippine Red Cross(PRC) appealed for humanitarian aid to help the more than 500,000 people affected by Typhoon Vinta (Tembin), which hit 23 provinces in the Philippines before Christmas day. 

PRC Chairman Richard Gordon made the appeal as figures on the number of deaths and missing people from the flashfloods and landslides that struck parts of Mindanao continue to rise in the wake of ‘Vinta’.

“Rural communities, which are in remote mountainous areas, are the hardest hit. Some villages are swept away by surging current of mud and water. We’re really in our toes right now. We’re trying to figure out how to bring our help closer to our people who are suffering right now” Gordon said. 

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) on Monday reported at least 164 people dead, while 171 remain missing. Majority of which are due to flashfloods and mudslides in the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Verification and validation from local government authorities are still ongoing.

“The focus at the moment is to find those who are still missing and to alleviate the suffering of those who survived. Slowly but surely, you can be sure the Red Cross will continue to be there for the people affected,” he said.

Gordon said the PRC will be immediately distributing P3,000 cash grants to 1,500 families from worst-hit communities. The priority will be the most vulnerable such as those who lost a family member and single parents.

“This is the fastest way we can bring assistance to our people. People are hungry before, now they are hungrier because of the typhoon. We want to give hope again to our people,” he added.

The PRC through the support of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will be distributing 1,000 non-food items in the coming days.

He added that more water tankers would be sent to provide clean water to the affected communities. 

Those with missing family members would also be assisted PRC’s Restoring Family Links Program

PRC volunteers and staff have been active on the ground providing round-the-clock humanitarian assistance even before the storm made landfall and during Christmas day.

So far, it already provided hot meals to 5,039 individuals and psychosocial support to 1,728.

PRC emergency responders also rescued 339 people and distributed 108,000 liters of water. 

So far, the Qatar Red Crescent Society has responded to PRC’s appeal and donated P14-million ($280,000) for the provision of additional food items, non-food items, water, sanitation and emergency shelter.

The Manila Bulletin also donated P1 million to support PRC’s ongoing emergency and relief operations.

2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",4593,"Food and Nutrition"

In an effort to better understand market dynamics in Libya, the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) was initiated by the Libya Cash & Markets Working Group (CMWG) in June 2017. The initiative is guided by the CMWG Markets Taskforce, led by REACH and supported by the CMWG members.

Markets in key urban areas across Libya are assessed on a monthly basis. In each location, field teams record prices and availability of basic food and nonfood items (NFI) sold in local shops and markets.

This factsheet presents an overview of price ranges and medians for key foods and NFIs in the assessed areas. The cleaned data sets are available on the REACH Resource Centre and distributed to CMWG partners, as well as to the broader humanitarian community.

In future rounds, the factsheet will include a Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB), which represents the minimum culturally adjusted group of items required to support a Libyan household for one month. The prices associated with the SMEB will illustrate variations in prices across assessed locations. The SMEB will be included once it has been agreed upon by all partners and may not contain all items assessed in the previous rounds.",4593,"Food and Nutrition"

2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4593,"Food and Nutrition"
2392929,"Turkey Food Security and Agriculture Sector - Quarter 3 - 2017 For almost all refugee households in Turkey, the primary source of food remains market purchase. Food insecurity among refugees therefore results, principally, from an inability to access sufficient food, or the right foods, due to their lack of purchasing power.  

This considered, FSA actors in Turkey have sought to address food insecurity among refugees through e-voucher and other restricted cash programming. In this context, in the past quarter alone, monthly dedicated food assistance was extended to up to 152,000 refugees living in both Temporary Accommodation Centres (TACs) and host communities.  

During the reporting period, partners also focused on promoting agricultural livelihoods and by the end of September over 780 refugees and vulnerable members of host communities received trainings in modern agriculture technologies. Alongside the training, in 2018-19, some of the FSA sector partners are also assessing the needs and planning for providing agriculture inputs support; farm-to-market, value chain, and agribusiness support, and environmental protection and preservation measures to create new work and entrepreneurship opportunities in areas hosting large refugee populations.

The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent.

2392184,"Severe malnutrition tops 11% in Bangladesh refugee camps - World Vision study 21 December 2017 (Cox's Bazar) – A recent nutrition screening of 1,862 children in Balukhali, Jamtoli and Thangkhali refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh found 199 (11 per cent) children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), according to child-focused World Vision, which conducted the seven-week assessment ending mid-December. 

“This data is alarmingly high. Although the sample size is only a fraction of all the children under five in the camps, even one child with SAM puts us one step closer to a higher mortality rate,” said Fred Witteveen, national director of World Vision Bangladesh. Severe acute malnutrition, the most visible and extreme form of undernutrition, is one of the world’s leading causes of death among children under five. 

Based on joint aid agency data from Cox’s Bazar in mid-December, of more than 35,000 children diagnosed with SAM, 18,083 have been admitted to therapeutic feeding centers for treatment, while close to 17,000 children are still in need of treatment. A recent multi-agency emergency nutrition assessment showed the prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) among all children 6-59 months of age at 24 per cent. The World Health Organization threshold for declaring a nutrition emergency is 15 per cent.

**Contributing causes** 

Poor access to clean water and improved sanitation can hurt a child’s nutritional status through diarrhoeal diseases and intestinal infections. 

According to a 3 December report in Cox’s Bazar, more than half a million people do not have adequate access to clean water and sanitation in and around the camps. Donors have funded only 23 percent of what is needed to provide 1.2 million people with sufficient water and basic sanitation. The continued arrival of refugees has further stretched already scarce facilities. Of the more than 5,300 tube wells installed, only 70 per cent work properly, while a little over one-third of the 35,650 temporary latrines are already not working. 

“Precarious access to and lack of these basic facilities in the camps can prove fatal, especially for children and others with weakened immunity,” shared Witteveen. “Most arrived in poor nutritional condition. We are racing to avoid the fatal tipping point many face.” 

To date, World Vision in partnership with UNICEF, has distributed hygiene kits and jerry cans to 14,500 people while hygiene promotion that targets at least 30,000 individuals has begun. Construction of 1,200 latrines, 600 gender sensitive bathing cubicles and 55 deep tube wells is also on-going, in close coordination with experts to ensure all facilities meet emergency response standards. World Vision has established four women and young child spaces to educate pregnant women and lactating mothers on child survival. 

Fighting that broke out almost four months ago in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State has forced out some 655,000 people to date into Bangladesh, almost all who identify as Rohingya. The population of the largest camp in Cox’s Bazar, known locally as Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, has multiplied more than five times since late August, now topping 547,000 people.

2392134,"Philippines: IFRC warns of worsening conditions following deadly Tropical Storm Tembin Manila/Kuala Lumpur 26 December —Four days after tropical storm Tembin made landfall in Mindanao, thousands of survivors are still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.

“Our teams in Mindanao are doing all they can to reach everyone who needs them. But the work is difficult and often slow,” says Philippine Red Cross Chairman Gordon. “Around the world, people are spending this time period with their families. For people affected by Tembin, what should be a peaceful time is instead full of uncertainty and fear. We need to help them.”

As responders reach the worst affected areas, details of the havoc wrought by Tembin (known locally as “Vinta”) continue to emerge. More than 500,000 people in 23 provinces have been affected. The national disaster risk reduction and management council (NDRRMC) confirms that 164 people have lost their lives to the flashfloods and landslides, with 176 are still missing. The number of casualties is expected to increase as the public authorities verify information being received from the provinces.

In addition to causing the loss of human lives and internal displacement, Tembin has substantially impacted shelter and livelihoods and caused damage to crops and critical infrastructure including roads, bridges and power transmission lines.

Volunteers and search and rescue teams from the Philippine Red Cross have been active since the hours before the storm made landfall, and are now working to reach people in need with water, food, and emergency shelter. Hot meals are being served, and welfare services provided in the evacuation centers, where over 50,000 people are staying after being evacuated prior to the landfall of the storm.

To support these efforts, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is joining the Philippine Red Cross in [appealing](https://reliefweb.int/node/2392084) for 2.8 million Swiss francs to assist more than 20,000 people affected by the storm in four of the worst affected provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro.

“People have gone through a massive shock. In just minutes, they lost everything, and then had to fight for their lives as walls of mud and water washed through their homes,” says Patrick Elliott, IFRC Operations and Programmes Manager in the Philippines.

“Now we must ensure that affected communities have immediate access to essential items and services including cash, food, water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, as well to information, psychosocial support, and protection.”

The Emergency Appeal is currently being revised and these changes will be reflected. The revised Emergency Appeal will be focused in carrying out roof repairs in coordination with the local authorities.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

**Overview of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement in the country**

The IFRC continues providing support and coordination with the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) through its Country Cluster Support Team based in Dominican Republic, and through the Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) based in Panama. The Country Cluster Support Team and the regional disaster management coordinator (also emergency shelter focal point) are giving the support to all the response actions of this operation. The sectors and needs addressed by this Emergency Appeal were identified by the CRC in coordination with the government.

The Spanish Red Cross, who has had presence in the country, deployed one staff member to support the National Society’s response efforts. In addition, on the onset of the emergency and on 9 October, two staff members from the Canadian Red Cross Society were deployed to Cuba with the aim to contribute to the response requirements of the Cuban Red Cross.

The Cuban Red Cross coordinated bilaterally with the Spanish Red Cross, through its permanent cooperation program, a shipment of new clothes and footwear for adults, and psycho-pedagogical centres including children without subsidiary protection.

**Movement Coordination**

The Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) has been sharing official information from the CRC with all Movement members. The CRC led coordination meetings at country level with the Spanish Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Society.

At the onset of Hurricane Irma, communication was established with Movement partners to inform of the storm’s path through the Caribbean. Similarly, the necessary information mechanisms were established through the Partnerships and Resource Development (PRD) department.",4593,"Food and Nutrition"

  PRC Chairman and CEO Richard Gordon said staff and volunteers from the 31 chapters in Mindanao and its National Headquarters are currently responding and closely monitoring the situation as Tropical Storm Vinta traverses the country. 

  “When the world no longer watches, the Philippine Red Cross stays to do what must be done. We are one in helping the most vulnerable, banking on our fundamental principle of humanity,” Gordon said.

   He added that the PRC also mobilized 82 staff and 1,955 volunteers from its 24 chapters in the Visayas to help those affected by Tropical Storm Urduja, which made a total of six landfalls on December 16.

  “I would like to commend the families of our staff and volunteers who continuously share their loved ones withus so they can be of service to humanity. This is the true spirit of the holiday season,” he added. 

‘Vinta’ Response

   For Vinta alone, the PRC has so far provided hot meals to 1,880 individuals and psychosocial support to 856people. 

  PRC volunteers were also first to respond when a ceiling of the Butuan City Jail collapsed during the height of Vinta last Friday. 

  Prepositioned non-food items from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for 1,000 families are also ready for distribution at the Philippine Red Cross Chapter in Cagayan de Oro.

‘Urduja’ Response

  Philippine Red Cross teams were among the first on the ground to assess and monitor the situation in the aftermath of Urduja. 

  So far, the Red Cross was able to provide rescue, welfare assistance, first aid management, hot meals, psychosocial support, and relief goods in Urduja-affected communities.

  Some 240 families received sleeping kits, which include blankets, towels, and plastic mats. Food items were also distributed to 651 affected families. Some 8,185individuals were provided with hot meals and 169 people were given psychosocial support.

  It can be recalled that the PRC was among the first to access Biliran province, one of the hardest hit areas by Urduja. The PRC set up a 5,000-liter water bladder at the Biliran Provincial Hospital to provide water regularly to patients and nearby residents, and provided anti-tetanus vaccines to injured individuals. 

   The Philippine Red Cross, as the foremost humanitarian organization in the country, has 103 chapters with two million volunteers nationwide that is always first, always ready and always there to provide round-the-clock humanitarian assistance, especially to the most vulnerable.

2391604,"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock – Statement on Yemen, 24 December 2017 I remain deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Yemen, where more than 22 million people need humanitarian assistance – 8.4 million of whom are already on the edge of starvation. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have continued and must stop. I am encouraged, however, by the news that the first commercial fuel imports into Hudaydah port since 6 November docked today, while commercial food imports that resumed in recent weeks have continued. 

Yemen imports approximately 90 per cent of its food and nearly all its fuel and medicine. The steady flow of these imports is a lifeline for millions of civilians. Commercial food imports are needed to keep food available and affordable in markets across the country. Fuel imports are essential to run generators in hospitals and health facilities, as well as to power water networks and sanitation systems, among other essential activities. Millions of people depend on these critical services. Hudaydah port is the closest port to the majority of Yemenis. 

As Yemen continues to grapple with widespread hunger, malnutrition, internal displacement, the world’s largest cholera outbreak, an alarming diphtheria outbreak and other challenges, it is essential that we work together to keep commercial food, medicine and fuel imports flowing into all ports. We must also ensure that life-saving humanitarian assistance is able to enter all ports swiftly and quickly reaches the millions of people who need it. Humanitarian aid is often shipped on commercial vessels, further underscoring the importance of keeping all ports open to humanitarian and commercial vessels. I am committed to working with all stakeholders to achieve this as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to seeing commercial imports of critical supplies stabilize at adequate levels. 

Commercial imports alone will not be enough to address the vast humanitarian crisis in Yemen or to provide a sustainable solution. I therefore reiterate my call for all parties to the conflict to provide unconditional, sustained humanitarian access – for both staff and supplies – across the country and without interference. I also call on all parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and engage meaningfully with the United Nations to achieve an inclusive, negotiated political settlement.

The 2017 Deyr season nutrition assessment among Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the main settlements and two urban areas shows Critical prevalence of acute malnutrition (Global Acute Malnutrition-GAM ≥ 15%) in 5 out of 15 population groups surveyed in November: Qardho IDPs, Galkacyo IDPs, Garowe, Mogadishu IDPs and Baidoa IDPs - see Map 1 and Table 2.  

However, the nutrition situation among IDPs in Baidoa, Dhusmareeb Hargeisa and Berbera has shown statistically significant improvement since June 2017 (Gu season). The 2017 Deyr assessment results for IDPs in Mogadishu, Dolow and Bossaso also reflect decreases in GAM and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence since 2017 Gu although these changes are not statistically significant.  

**Assessment Overview** 

FSNAU and partners conducted joint Nutrition and Food security assessment among 15 population groups (13 IDP and two urban) across Somalia in November 2017 (Table 1). The objective of the assessments was to monitor the nutrition situation of IDPs in the 13 main IDP settlements and in selected urban areas (Mogadishu and Kismayo) as part of FSNAU’s biannual surveillance activities.  

A two-stage probability proportionate to size (PPS) cluster sampling protocol, based on SMART Methodology was used, with the exception of Qardho, Berbera and Dhusamareb IDP settlements where sampling was exhaustive. Retrospective mortality data for 136 days prior to the assessments was also collected among all sampled households. Mortality, food security and nutritional data was collected concurrently from the same households. Variables (anthropometric and all other contextual indicators) and mortality were entered using EPI info soft 3.5.4 and ENA SMART software (July 9th, 2015 version), respectively. For quality assurance, enumerators and supervisors received five days of training prior to data collection. During the field work, anthropometric dataset were checked on a daily basis using ENA SMART software plausibility parameters.  

GAM was estimated using World Health Organization growth standards, while Crude Death Rates (CDRs) and Under-Five Death Rates (U5DR) for children less than 5 years of age were calculated using the most recent population estimates available (UNDP PESS, 2014; CCCM DSA in Baidoa). The event used to calculate the recall period for the 2017 Deyr mortality assessment among IDP/urban populations was the beginning of Eidul Fitir religious holiday (i.e. 25 June 2017). Nutrition status of a total of 10 271 children (6-59 months) drawn from 7 412 households was assessed among 13 IDPs and two urban settlements covered in the 2017 Deyr assessment.",4593,"Food and Nutrition"

- Of the nine provinces, 3 provinces (namely Karusi, Kayanza, and Kirundo) have relatively high levels of acute malnutrition levels which require particular attention.

- The major factors contributing to acute malnutrition include very poor quality of food, relatively high prevalence of diseases, and very poor sanitation.

- While the immediate response must focus on treating children with acute malnutrition, it is also vital to plan interventions to address the major contributing factors in order to reduce acute malnutrition levels.",4593,"Food and Nutrition"
2391339,"Burundi: Acute Food Insecurity Situation October - December 2017 and January - May 2018 Based on the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) scale, 9 of the 18 provinces in Burundi are classified as in Phase 2 while the other provinces are categorised as being in Phase 1. According to the IPC AMN scale, Phase 2 indicates ‘Alert’ situation, which requires strengthening of existing response capacity and resilience and addressing of contributing factors to malnutrition as well as monitoring of the situation.

Of the nine provinces classified as being in “Alert” situation with regards to acute malnutrition, 3 provinces (namely Karusi, Kayanza, and Kirundo) have relatively high levels of acute malnutrition levels which require particular attention. It's worth to recall that at least 3 cases of Noma have been registered this year in Kirundo province.

Approximately about 125,000 children are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 9 of the 18 provinces alone in the country. Available data on the coverage of acute malnutrition treatment suggests that the coverage is not optimal.

Major contributing factors to acute malnutrition identified during the analysis are (1) very poor quality of food intake by children, (2) relatively high prevalence of diseases (particularly malaria), and (3) poor sanitation – see annex II for details on major contributing factors to acute malnutrition by province. It is noted that the quality of food intake by children is poor even in provinces where acute food insecurity is low. This suggests that it may be related to behaviour and/or lack of awareness of child feeding among caregivers. Poor quality of food in other provinces may likely be the result of both food insecurity as well as behaviour and lack of awareness. Several structural issues especially human, physical, and financial capital were also identified as major factors contributing to acute malnutrition in these areas. Anaemia is a major public health problem that calls for urgent attention in all provinces.

According to the IPC AMN projection analysis, the situation is likely to remain the same in all 9 provinces that are classified as Phase 2 during the upcoming rainy season (February-May 2018). However, slight deterioration in acute malnutrition levels are likely in some provinces because of seasonality and disease trends.

2391214,"GIEWS Country Brief: Lesotho 20-December-2017 **FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT**

- Dry conditions during planting period of 2018 cereal crops

- However, rainfall prospects generally favourable for remainder of current 2017/18 season

- Maize production in 2017 estimated at well aboveaverage level

- Ample cereal supplies result in reduced import requirements for 2017/18 marketing year and increased stock levels

- Food security conditions improved significantly, mostly on account of increased agricultural output

**Dry conditions at start of 2017/18 cropping season**

Land preparation and planting for the 2018 cereal crops is underway and is expected to be finalized by the end of the year. Abnormal dry conditions were observed during most of September and November, resulting in below-average vegetation conditions in cropped areas in the main cereal-producing northern regions. However, heavier rains were recorded at the beginning of December and meteorological forecasts point to a higher likelihood of above-average rainfall in the first quarter of 2018. Should the favourable rains materialize, the current moisture deficits are expected to be reversed with a positive effect on 2018 production prospects.

**Production rebounded strongly in 2017**

Based on the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics’ agricultural assessment, cereal production in 2017 is estimated at a well above-average level of 238 000 tonnes, a significant increase compared to the drought-reduced level of 2016. Most of this increase reflects a sharp upturn in maize production, estimated at 200 000 tonnes. In addition, there was a sharp increase for sorghum production, while the wheat output is estimated at an average level, but still well above the previous year’s output.

**Import requirements drop in 2017/18**

As a result of the bumper 2017 output, cereal import requirements are estimated at a well below-average level of 177 000 tonnes in the 2017/18 marketing year (April/March). Of this amount, imports of maize would account for 65 000 tonnes.

In addition, given the favourable supply situation, stock levels are forecast to rise sharply in 2017/18 to near average levels.

**Decreased number of food insecure**

The food security situation has improved markedly in 2017/18 compared to the previous year where an estimated 709 000 people required food assistance. Based on the latest 2017 Lesotho Vulnerability Assessment Committee’s (LVACs) evaluation, the number of food insecure people in 2017/18 is estimated at about 225 000.

Latest information indicates that Tembin has caused dozens – potentially hundreds – of fatalities, damaged thousands of houses, washed away vast amounts of livelihoods and disrupted the lives of people mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao Island in the Philippines.  

According to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Tropical Storm Tembin made landfall in Cateel,  Davao Oriental, on Friday 22 December 2017 afternoon packing maximum winds of 90 kilometres per hour (km/h) and gusts of up to 125 km/h. The tropical storm then continued across Mindanao, tracking over the provinces of Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental and Zamboanga del Norte. It weakened before re-intensifying late Saturday, 23 December, and is now threatening southern parts of Palawan. In a bulletin issued at 17:00h local time on Saturday, PAGASA indicated that Tembi was packing maximum winds of 90 km/h and gustiness of up to 115 km/h.

2392089,"IOM Iraq Holds Community Policing Conference on Ninewa Baghdad - In cooperation with Iraq’s Ministry of Interior, IOM Iraq held a conference on 20 December on Community Policing in Ninewa Governorate, which aims to promote cooperation between law enforcement agencies and community members towards peace and security.

Ninewa was deeply affected by the occupation by ISIL and associated conflict, with heavy damage to its infrastructure – especially in its capital Mosul – and extensive displacement, with more than 941,000 individuals still displaced across the governorate.

In 2016, with funding from the German Federal Foreign Office, IOM Iraq started the project to strengthen community policing in retaken areas of Ninewa and other conflict-affected areas in Iraq. This is done through the establishment of Community Policing Forums (CPFs) which are inclusive platforms that involve police officers, local leaders, civil society organization representatives and community members, where citizens can raise and discuss their security concerns. CPFs identify and develop initiatives that lead to safer communities, protect the most vulnerable and enhance cooperation, transparency and mutual trust between these actors. CPF members analyze the available resources in their respective communities and assess the ability of a wide range of actors to find solutions to situations that are potentially dangerous and harmful. As such, CPFs are tools for conflict prevention.

The conference followed a series of activities in November and December that included the establishment of five new CPFs in Ninewa and training for more than 400 individuals, including police officers, community members and civil society representatives, on applying community policing in a context of post-conflict returns.  

The conference was preceded by a three-day workshop exploring the role of women in security dialogue. Over 80 women and men from across Iraq participated, including police, civil society representatives and the community members, to discuss the impact of gender-based violence on community security, the role of women in violent extremism and how women and children affiliated with ISIL should be treated. Workshop participants formed working groups on these topics, and discussed how to implement action plans developed in the event.

The Community Policing conference on Ninewa was held in Baghdad and was attended by government officials, notably Mr. Saad Maan, spokesman of the Ministry of Interior and the Head of Community Police Directorate, Brigadier General Khalid Al Mhannah, NGO staff and CPF representatives from Mosul, Fallujah and Baghdad.

Brigadier General Saad Maan, spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, thanked the German Government, IOM and guests for their efforts in support of the CP model.  “We have been working very hard to put Iraqi citizens first. There will be no sustainable security in the governorates unless citizens are part of it, and that is exactly the foundation of this initiative, by strengthening community policing forums across the country, especially in Ninewa. We have achieved great results in stabilizing the country thanks to the cooperation with our international partners,” said Saad Maan.

Speakers also included CPF members from Al-Amiriat Al-Fallujah and Mosul (Baasheka), police officers, community members and civil society organization representatives, who introduced and discussed the successes and challenges of the CPFs in Ninewa. The conference gave CPF members the opportunity to network and share experiences.

“The sharing of experiences, successes and challenges of Community Policing Forums in retaken areas will help us to improve the next phase of this project and build on mutual trust that has been established”, said IOM Iraq Chief of Mission Gerard Waite.

“I am very grateful for the cooperation between the government of Iraq and Germany on this Community Policing project,” said Dr. Cyrill Nunn, German Ambassador to Iraq. “We have high hopes that the success of the project can contribute to the much-needed reconciliation and stabilization in Iraq,” added the Ambassador, highlighting the valuable contribution of CPFs for the stabilization of the Iraqi social fabric.

A total of 66 CPFs have been established across Iraq; of which 42 with the support of IOM Iraq; the other 24 have been independently established by local police and communities.

Will 2017 be the watershed moment for gender equality, as brave women break their silence on gender-based violence in unprecedented numbers, and men and women come together to challenge inequality and stereotypes?

At UN Women, we work with brave women and men every single day, many of whom you may never have heard of. Women who have broken the barriers at home and in politics, men who have refused to stay silent bystanders, and refugees who have shown us what resilience looks like.

Take a look back at some of their stories.

In February 2017, Sdiri founded Entr@crush, a new kind of online platform for Tunisian youth who have entrepreneurial ideas, to network with like-minded people, donors and entrepreneurs. It provides e-learning courses in a variety of topics, from management and accounting to communications, to prepare young entrepreneurs.

She says, “One day, I want to wake up to find gender equality is real. I will stay out late that night; I will wear whatever I want to, without worrying about being harassed. I will be free to live by myself if I wanted to; I will earn as much as a man.”

Koyesh Miah attends Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in Bangladesh and until recently, used to be a silent bystander, like many others, when other men sexually harassed women. Since participating in a UN Women programme, Miah started to understand the serious ramifications of sexual harassment and is ready to tackle it head on.

Koyesh says: “Before we joined the campaign group, many of us thought [sexual harassment] was harmless fun...We didn’t realize how our behaviour affected women and girls.

Through the campaign, students got the opportunity to hear from their female classmates about the way they feel about sexual harassment. It helped us understand how much this so-called ‘funny’ behaviour humiliated women and girls…how it affects their self-esteem, confidence, mobility and opportunities.

Today I know how to raise my voice against sexual harassment. Whenever and wherever a girl faces harassment in front of me, now I never think twice about protesting.”

2388024,"Workshop for integrating the gender approach into adaptation planning for agricultural sectors 19 December 2017 - A workshop was held in Bogota, Colombia, from 30 November to 1 December to begin the process of incorporating gender analysis into adaptation planning process in Colombia. The workshop was organized with the objective of identify opportunities to promote gender-responsive adaptation in the agricultural sector. 

The event was attended by 47 people representing the Ministries of Environment and Sustainable Development, Agriculture and Rural Development, agencies of the agricultural sector, research institutes, universities, international NGOs, farmer organizations, women's organizations and members of the insurance sector.

A set of methods and tools for gender analysis that were applied to concrete cases were shared by the participants. The conversation focused on finding the links between adaptation and promotion of gender equality, taking as a point of entry the country context and the existing gaps in gender mainstreaming.

To start day 1, the UNDP-FAO Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans Programme (NAP-Ag) team presented the context of the NAP-Ag programme including the elements and characteristics of the planning process according to the UNFCCC framework and the importance of including gender analysis in adaptation planning. Subsequently, the context of the NAP-Ag programme in Colombia was presented, followed by awareness-raising and application of methods and tools for gender analysis.

2387229,"Nigeria: On-going operational screening in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States (November 2017) **Protection trends**

Protection needs of internally displaced and IDP returnees are dire in the 12 LGAs of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States surveyed by the vulnerability screening. The continuing crisis severely impacts upon the most vulnerable civilians, including female and child-headed households, naccompanied/separated children, adolescent boys and girls, the elderly, the chronically sick, people with physical and mental disabilities, and pregnant and lactating women within IDP camps, host communities and return areas. In the newly accessible areas profiled, IDPs and IDP returnees have experienced grave violations including brutal attacks with resulting death, injuries and trauma, sexual violence, abduction, forced marriage, arbitrary arrests and detention, family separation, disappearances and forced recruitment. Recovery efforts continue to be hampered in many areas by lack of civilian infrastructure, conflict-driven insecurity, access constraints and limited availability of basic services for survival, all of which exacerbate protection risks for the most vulnerable populations. 

**Boys and girls** have witnessed or experienced serious violence and instability throughout displacement. These experiences, coupled with continuing uncertainty and risks of violence, has had an acute impact on their psychological well-being. Many children have been recruited, abducted or held by Boko Haram, during which time they have witnessed, experienced and sometimes participated in physical and sexual violence. 14% of vulnerable HHs report to have **unaccompanied or separated children**, with 69% of such households reporting that these children have been *orphaned by the conflict*. 
Recent reports identify a rise in the numbers of children that are **out of school** in all of the surveyed LGAs. This is due in part to lack of basic facilities, including school facilities in many towns, as large numbers of school buildings were targeted and destroyed by Boko Haram and remaining schools are being used as shelter to host displaced populations. There are also temporary schools in IDP camps which are severely overcrowded and can’t accommodate the large numbers of children, such as in Ngala and Banki. Failure to provide children with opportunities for education has heightened their risks of exploitation, with increased levels of **child labour** being reported. Girls who are out of school have been forced into marriages at higher rates and boys have been involved in hawking and begging. Being out of school further exacerbates levels of poverty and may lead to future risk of criminality and radicalization, as well as use by armed groups. Many households reported to be sending their children into the streets in risky conditions to **hawk and beg** to try to bring back money for survival of the family; others have been sent by their parents to be part of the Almajiri system for Quranic schooling and are forced to beg for sustenance. 

Women and girls have been significantly affected by the crisis, with the number of **female-headed households** (21% of vulnerable HHs) and widows persistently increasing, due to the engagement of men in the insurgency as active combatants and/or as the consequence of massive incarceration of alleged members of armed groups for national security reasons.  
**Violence against women and girls** is widespread but grossly underreported due to fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, stigmatization and subsequent ostracization by communities/family members and limited availability and confidence in response services. Women and adolescent girls live in undignified conditions in over-crowded sites with weak protection and security measures in place and are attacked while conducting everyday activities such as fetching water, firewood and going to the community latrines. **Rape and sexual abuse** has been perpetrated with impunity during all stages of the crisis—while women/girls flee violence, during abduction and in enduring displacement circumstances—including by members of security forces and non-state armed groups. When women and girls are released or escaped from Boko Haram captivity, they often report aggravated and repeated cases of rape and abuse. There are alarming trends of **sexual exploitation** in affected areas, allegedly being perpetrated by members of the security forces and Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) as well as by national humanitarian actors. For women and girls living in overcrowded displacement sites, resources are shrinking and their resilience is pushed to the limits. For those living in camps, freedom of movement is curtailed. Adolescent girls and women are forced into survival sex in exchange for food, authorization to move in and out of the camps to pursue livelihoods and other key necessities, including firewood.  

Although **early/forced marriage** was commonly practiced among different communities in North East Nigeria before the armed conflict started, the number of such marriages has dramatically risen. This is partly due to the security and socioeconomic difficulties families are going through in the camps and host communities; including increased poverty levels, reduced freedom of movement, lack of livelihood opportunities and food availability and a limited access to education.  
Marriage is often seen as a means of providing safety from abduction by the insurgents who are believed to not want to ‘marry’ already married women. Girls who have been sexually exploited during displacement and become pregnant are also being forced to marry in order to prevent social stigma from the pregnancy. 

Vulnerability screening has also seen a dramatic rise in the number of identified cases of **domestic violence**. This involves men abusing their wives or refusing to provide for their needs and those of their children. The tensions of conflict and displacement, and the frustrations of men associated with resulting powerlessness and loss of traditional roles as the provider and head of household have reportedly manifested in increasing spousal abuse. Further, men have lashed out at their wives following a number of humanitarian initiatives in which support is mainly provided to women and girls. As domestic violence is often locally condoned rather than recognized as abuse in the North East, the drastic increase in the number of reported cases (1,552 HHs) speaks to the severity of violence.  

A high number of vulnerable households report to have **elderly with pressing protection needs**, 76% of which are **elderly-headed**. Throughout the conflict-induced displacement, there has been a breakdown in family support structures with the deaths of caregivers of elderly, leaving many to now be left alone with no form of family support while often further needing to care for young grandchildren. Such elderly are disproportionally dependent upon humanitarian aid to meet their basic needs including food and may be unable to access services even in locations where such services are available due to infirmities and disabilities. In locations such as Biu, Gulani, Michika and Chibok where humanitarian agencies are limited, vulnerable elderly face heightened risks.  

**Serious medical conditions**, both chronic illnesses and critical health conditions, were reported (by 7% of vulnerable households) as well as **physical disabilities** (by 4% of vulnerable households), many of which were sustained through the conflict. Cultural norms in the North East often prevent the recognition and reporting of **mental disabilities**. Yet, a growing number of households identified mental disabilities manifesting from trauma experienced throughout the insurgency and displacement. In Banki, there was a noted rise in the reporting of mental health cases. As specialized mental health services are not available in newly accessible sites, cases are considered for referred to Maiduguri for proper care.  

Nearly every single vulnerable household (99%) across the 12 LGAs reported to be unable to provide for their daily needs. Prolonged **absence of livelihood** opportunities has brought vulnerabilities in areas of displacement and return to critical levels, exacerbating risks of exploitation, malnutrition, health conditions and other protection risks. Lack of livelihood is also closely tied with the encampment policy in most LGA headquarters in newly accessible areas as well as restrictions that continue to be placed on IDP and IDP returnee movement which does not allow them to leave sites to pursue sources of income. Also, in locations such as Ngala, Damasak, Gwoza and Banki, IDPs and IDP returnees reported prevailing fears of Boko Haram attacks and abduction as camps and communities in such locations were repeatedly targeted by insurgents in 2017. 

96% of vulnerable households **lack documentation**, which impedes access to basic services such as healthcare and education and hinders enforcement of land/property rights. Without identity documents, those in camps have had their freedom of movement curtailed, creating an environment in which camp authorities have forced some women and girls to trade themselves to obtain a movement permit to exit and enter camps. Further, cases have been reported where individuals whose identities cannot be ascertained have been arbitrarily **arrested and detained** without their family’s knowledge of their whereabouts, or have otherwise been intimidated by authorities and community members.",4594,"Gender"
2385194,"Occupied Palestinian Territory: Humanitarian Needs Overview 2018, November 2017 OVERVIEW 

The humanitarian context of the oPt is unique amongst today’s crises and remains directly tied to the impact of the occupation, which marked its 50th year in June 2017. A protracted protection crisis continues. At least 1.9 million Palestinians experience, or are at risk of, conflict and violence, displacement and denial of access to livelihoods, among other threats. The most vulnerable Palestinians are currently denied or restricted in their access to essential services such as water and health care. A recurrent cycle of shocks, natural and manmade, has eroded the resilience of vulnerable households to cope with the prolonged nature of the humanitarian crisis. 

These dynamics are significantly magnified in the Gaza context by the protracted blockade, imposed by Israel citing security concerns after the takeover of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, three major escalations of hostilities in less than ten years and the intensification of the internal divide between the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) and the de facto Hamas authorities during the course of 2017. Combined, these factors have devastated public infrastructure, disrupted the delivery of basic services and undermined already vulnerable living conditions. Across the oPt, one in two Palestinians, or roughly two and a half million people, will need some form of humanitarian assistance in 2018.

GAZA STRIP 

The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip deteriorated markedly in 2017 due to an escalation in the internal Palestinian political divide, following the decision in March by the de facto Hamas leadership to establish a parallel structure to run local ministries in Gaza.In response, the PA reduced payments for electricity, the allowances of public employees, and payments for the referral of patients for treatment outside Gaza. Longer power outages have negatively impacted basic health and water and sanitation services and limited the ability of farmers to irrigate their lands, further undermining food security and livelihoods. Following Egyptian mediation, the two sides reached an agreement in October 2017, which envisages the PA resuming control of the Gaza crossings, as a necessary first step towards alleviating the humanitarian situation and achieving the goal of Palestinian unity under a single, democratic and legitimate national authority. The measures put in place in Gaza in 2017 by the PA had yet to be reversed at the time of preparation of the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO).

The magnitude of the challenges facing Gaza is underlined in a recent United Nations report projecting the situation of Gaza in the year 2020. The study revisited key indicators first published in 2012, and found “that most of the projections for 2020 have in fact deteriorated even further and faster than anticipated” with the population increasing and the economy and basic infrastructure and services deteriorating, and “simply unable to keep up with demand.” Real GDP growth in Gaza has slowed to only 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, while the unemployment rate for the second quarter rose to 44 per cent. Unemployment among those aged between 15 and 29 has reached a “staggering” 62 per cent. According to The Economist, “In real terms, Gazans are about 25 per cent poorer today than they were at the time of the Oslo Accords.” The standard of living in Gaza, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person of $1,700 a year in 2015, is comparable to Congo-Brazzaville; the West Bank figure, $3,700 a year, is similar to Egypt; while Israel, $35,000 a year, is “much the same as France”.

The August 2014 ceasefire continues to hold, with a relatively low number of Palestinian fatalities (17) and injuries (221) by Israeli forces as of November 2017, and no further conflict-related displacement recorded.  Approximately 23,500 people still remain displaced from the 2014 conflict, as of November 2017. The Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has played a key role in facilitating increased imports of construction materials; however, it has been less successful in facilitating the import of dual use materials beyond cement and re-bar, also critical for public works projects.  
As of November 2017, 5,755 out of the 11,000 totally destroyed housing units have been reconstructed and work on an additional 818 is underway. Insufficient funding is the primary obstacle to completing the remaining residential reconstruction projects.

Most of the two million Palestinians in Gaza remain unable to access the remainder of the oPt and the outside world, with only a minority eligible for exit permits via Israel, primarily patients, business people and the staff of international organizations. Although the number of Palestinian exits increased after the 2014 hostilities, figures have declined significantly again since the second half of 2016, with the figure for November 2017 some 47 per cent below the 2016 average. While there has been a gradual increase in the absolute number of medical patients allowed through the Israeli-controlled Erez crossing, the approval rate has also been declining, at 55 per cent in October compared to 93 per cent in 2012. While the number of approved permit applications for United Nations national staff to leave Gaza increased by 19.7 per cent from the second half of 2016 to the first half of 2017, the Israeli authorities have significantly increased the time necessary for processing permits, from 26 to 55 working days, impeding humanitarian operations.  
Movement constraints have been compounded by the protracted closure of the Rafah terminal, which has only partially opened for 29 days in 2017, allowing 1,222 patients to exit for medical treatment.

**Protection** 

Although the 2014 ceasefire has held, the ongoing restrictions on the movement of people and goods and the threat of a new round of hostilities are major protection concerns for Palestinians in Gaza. These concerns are exacerbated by the rising hopelessness and deterioration in the humanitarian situation, as well as by the shooting of rockets at Israel and the digging of attack tunnels, among other factors. The risk of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) remains and high levels of psychosocial distress are reported across the population, particularly among children, leaving them with a deep sense of insecurity, fear and hopelessness. The protracted humanitarian crisis has also exacerbated genderbased-violence (GBV) in all its forms, including sexual violence, domestic violence and child marriage. The Protection Cluster continues to identify accountability for violations during the Gaza hostilities in 2014, by all sides, and for violations during the daily enforcement of restrictions in the Access Restricted Areas (ARAs) as an urgent priority. 

**Displacement**

No new displacement was recorded in Gaza in 2017. The GRM has provided access to vital construction materials, but as of November 2017 funding is lacking for the reconstruction of about 3,800 destroyed and over 56,500 damaged housing units from the 2014 round of hostilities. Displacement continues for 23,500 people who are primarily reliant on temporary shelter cash assistance (TSCA) to rent accommodation until their homes are reconstructed or rehabilitated. TSCA been disrupted due to significant funding shortages with anecdotal evidence suggesting that this has resulted in debt accumulation and the adoption of negative coping mechanisms such as withdrawing children from school or engaging children in income generation.10 Some 4,500 families who have not yet received assistance to repair conflict-related damages are in urgent need of support due to continued exposure to the elements, high vulnerability and lack of resources. In addition, 8,100 families are at risk of exposure due to inadequate protection against the natural elements.  

**Access to essential services** 

The provision of basic services in Gaza remains a key humanitarian concern. Increasing electricity cuts are undermining basic services already depleted by the blockade, recurrent hostilities and restrictions on the import of goods considered “dual use”. Surgeries are being delayed, some diagnostic services are being put on hold, and there has been a disruption in the delivery of primary healthcare (PHC) and secondary healthcare (SHC) services by the Ministry of Health (MoH). Health provision is also impeded by delays in the shipment of essential drugs and disposables from the PA Ministry of Health, which has also recently been delaying or suspending payment for the referral of patients for medical treatment outside Gaza. The number of permit applications denied or delayed by Israel to access health care outside Gaza has also been on the increase, reaching 45 per cent of applications in October 2017.  

The blockade and escalations in hostilities have also resulted in repeated damage and the destruction of infrastructure, the deaths of students and teachers and psychosocial stress among children and teachers. Increasing electricity shortages are affecting children’s right and ability to access education at school and at home, restricting study time and their ability to concentrate.  
Some 70 per cent of UNRWA schools and over 63 per cent of Ministry of Education schools operate on a double or triple shift system which has reduced instruction time to about four hours a day, and limited the time available to reinforce learning, support slow learners, and offer remedial education and extracurricular activities. Psychosocial services are also struggling to cope with the nearly 300,000 children who require some form of mental health support or psychosocial intervention. 
 
Water and sanitation (WASH) infrastructure and delivery has also been impacted by recurrent conflict, the over exploitation of resources and restrictions on the import of “dual use” WASH items. Over 95 per cent of the water extracted from the aquifer is unfit for human consumption, with the result that 90 per cent of people in Gaza rely on purchasing desalinated water from private trucking, posing a heavy financial burden on already impoverished families and health risks due to widespread contamination of that source. Increased electricity cuts have further reduced the drinkable/ piped water supply and the operation of approximately 130 critical water and sanitation facilities. This has resulted in the discharge of untreated sewage into the sea, contaminating the majority of Gaza beaches, and heightening the risk of the overflow of raw sewage onto the streets.  

**Erosion of resilience** 

Recurrent hostilities, the blockade, degraded infrastructure and cuts in the allowances of public employees have impaired economic growth and perpetuated high levels of poverty, unemployment, (particularly among youth), and food insecurity. About 80 per cent of people in Gaza receive food assistance and other forms of social transfers which enable scarce cash resources to be spent on other essentials, preventing a further deterioration of food security and livelihood status, and reducing the impact of negative coping mechanisms. Increased power shortages have further undermined economic activity, particularly in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, with some 30,000 out of 80,000 dunums planted with seasonal vegetable crops at risk due to irregular irrigation, and dairy cattle farmers and poultry breeders also facing significant losses. The condition of the aquifer, Gaza’s sole source of natural water, is of particular concern as it will be “unusable” by end-2017, with damage “irreversible” by 2020, “unless immediate remedial action is taken.”",4594,"Gender"
2384454,"UNMIL Facilitates the conference of women in the security sector Monrovia - On 14 December 2017, the Ministries of Justice, Defense and Gender, Children and Social Protection supported by the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) convened a Conference of Women in the Security Sector under the slogan ‘Nothing for Us, Without Us,’ at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs premises.

The UNMIL Security Sector Reform representative, Mr. Michael Page,  noted that although significant progress has been made in mainstreaming gender into the Liberia’s security sector process, there are some aspects that require robust reform and strengthening. “These challenges consequently pose major obstacles to an inclusive security sector that can sustain the peace after the full withdrawal of the peacekeeping mission from Liberia,” said Mr. Page. 

The conference aimed to bring together key stakeholders from across Liberia to identify the main challenges that women face in the security sector and consensus on solutions and recommendations in prevention and response to sexual and gender based violence in the security institutio­­ns.

In attendance of the conference were around 120 participants representing security sectors institution, civil society groups and international partners, including the Swedish Ambassador, African Union Ambassador, representatives from ECOWAS, US Embassy, UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR, UNMIL and UN Women.

The conference involved panels of discussions on situation of women in the security sector and trajectories of the first females that jointed the security institutions.  The conference concluded with Gender Champions Awards that honored 15 men and women for their efforts in promoting gender equality and fighting violence against women in the security sector.",4594,"Gender"

Brussels, 13 December 2017

Niger is a priority country for the EU and one which it cooperates closely with under the Strategy for Security and Development in the Sahel and the New Migration Partnership Framework.

**Complex situation**

Niger faces many challenges: security, migration, environment, demography, development and the humanitarian situation. In 2016 it was second from bottom of the United Nations Human Development Index, despite having made progress in recent years in terms of economic growth and social development. The food security situation is structurally fragile because of poor harvests caused by drought and recurring floods (the result of climate change). Population growth continues to be a huge challenge for the government, with a growth rate of 3.9 % and a fertility rate of 7.6 births per woman.

The socio-economic and security situation in Niger has worsened considerably in recent years, particularly in 2017, mainly because of the growing criminal and terrorist threats and the ensuing humanitarian crises in the Lake Chad region and in areas bordering Mali and Libya. Around 260 000 displaced persons, refugees and returnees have fallen victim to this lack of security and remain heavily dependent on international aid, particularly humanitarian aid. The G5 Sahel Joint Force, which is about to become operational, should help reduce these security threats.

Despite these vulnerabilities and challenges, significant progress has been made in recent years in the economic and development sectors. This has been possible thanks to the considerable efforts made by the government to undertake reforms under the 2013-2016 «Economic and Social Development Plan» (PDES), the latest version of which for the period 2017-2021 will be presented at the Round Table in Paris on 13 and 14 December. These reforms must be consolidated if the country is to continue on the path of development. The EU is supporting Niger in its efforts and will continue to do so.

**Cooperation between the EU and Niger**

In line with its integrated approach, the EU is mobilising all available support instruments to strengthen the government's capacities in the areas of governance, security, the fight against irregular migration and trafficking, humanitarian operations and sustainable development in all its forms.

- EU financial support for development in Niger (National Indicative Programme) amounts to EUR 596 million under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) over the period 2014-2020. Seventy-five per cent of this funding is provided in the form of budget support, in order to foster and strengthen the State's capacities, particularly in the areas of justice, sound management of public finances, security, education and food security.

- Previously, under the 10th European Development Fund (2008-2013), Niger received a total of EUR 508 million, allocated to three areas: rural development and food security, regional integration and governance. Thirty-five per cent of this funding was provided in the form of budget support, with the aim of supporting the country's efforts to improve access to basic social services, protect vulnerable sections of the population and promote good governance and the rule of law.

**Examples of cooperation with Niger:**

**Sector Reform Contract for food and nutrition security and sustainable agricultural development (SANAD)** EUR 243 million from 2016 to 2020

Food and nutrition security and sustainable agricultural development, which affect 80 % of the population and involve the supply of raw materials to build up a strong agri-food sector, are the primary tool for development and the eradication of poverty in the country. This budget support programme aims to boost the government's financial capacity to achieve sectoral policy objectives, strengthen governance and promote sectoral reforms and policies, and to meet the basic needs of the population through improved access to services in the areas of sustainable agriculture, and food and nutrition security.

For example, the programme will help increase access to drinking water to 65 % nationwide by 2020 and reduce by 1 % each year the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children under 5 years of age.

**Sector Reform Contract for Education, EUR 77 million from 2016 to 2019**

The sectoral budget support programme for education is designed to support the efforts of the government of Niger to improve equal access, quality and governance in education. One of the main reforms targeted is the reduction of inequalities in access to education, particularly at primary and secondary level. In addition to respecting the fundamental right to education, keeping girls at school is closely linked with reducing cases of early marriage and fertility, thus contributing to better control of population growth. The Education SRC also supports improved quality of learning at school and increased efficiency in the education system, particularly by fostering reforms in the areas of management of teachers and public finances.

This programme has helped to increase the net enrolment rate from 62.6 % in 2013 to 66.1 % in 2017 and to significantly boost the primary completion rate from 78.4 % in 2016 to 83 % in 2017.

**The Emergency Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa**

In order to manage migration and displacement in Africa, the European Commission created an «Emergency Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa». The Trust Fund benefits a wide range of countries in Africa, especially those located along the main African migration routes to Europe. Niger is one of those countries.

Nine projects, worth a total of EUR 190 million, have already been approved for Niger under the Trust Fund. These projects are the EU's practical response to commitments undertaken as part of the Action Plan adopted at the Valletta Summit on 11 and 12 November 2015, in which Niger will play a highly pro-active and constructive role. Niger is currently the main beneficiary of the Trust Fund. The activities under the Emergency Trust Fund in Niger focus on protecting migrants and facilitating reintegration, strengthening the government's capacity to combat criminal networks and better manage its borders, as well as supporting host communities by creating economic alternatives for populations who live from activities related to irregular migration.

Niger also receives funding from regional instruments (Regional Indicative Programme for West Africa, intra-ACP programmes), thematic headings and other instruments, such as the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.

One example of a migration project in Niger is the Response mechanism and resources for migrants programme (EUR 7 million), in addition to the EU - IOM Joint initiative for migrant protection and reintegration (EUR 15 million from 2016 to 2020). The project aims to support Niger's response to the complex migratory flows passing through its territory, for example by promoting economic and social development through circular migration. The aim is to help national and regional authorities improve their governance of migration through the mechanism. From May to mid-November 2017, the initiative enabled the voluntary return of 3 603 migrants from Niger, who received assistance on arrival. Almost 49 000 migrants have benefited from awareness-raising activities since April 2017.",4594,"Gender"

This report contains in-depth information on seven gender equality promising practices that are part of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ (UNHCR’s) response to the Syria crisis in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Over the last six years, UNHCR and partners have implemented numerous catalytic initiatives that seek to address specific gender-related protection needs and risks of diverse Syrian women, men, boys and girls, as well as drawing upon their existing capacities. It is now important to document these initiatives to ensure that our efforts, as well as lessons learned, will continue to be built upon in the interest of pursuing gender equality as an integral element of humanitarian programming.  

This report aims to provide information and inspiration to UNHCR colleagues, partners and other international and national organizations working together with refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Extreme levels of violence and destruction characterize the on going insurgency in North East Nigeria. The conflict between the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Boko Haram group has widely affected the population in the states of Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, Gombe, Bauchi and Taraba. As the conflict intensified, women, girls and children have disproportionately been affected and the prevalence of sexual and gender-based violence has drastically increased. For instance, reports indicate that over 40% of the health care infrastructure has been destroyed by the conflict raising serious reproductive and other health concerns for women and girls. The humanitarian needs for life saving Gender Based Violence (GBV) and sexual and reproductive health interventions are identified as needing urgent attention and prioritization beyond what the current response is able to meet.  

Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA): Continues to be a reality in the NE with increasing reports received, at least 10 cases reported & followed since January 2017. The reliance on humanitarian aid remains a risk factor for beneficiaries, while preliminary results from community consultations reveal that perpetrators include – drivers, CJTF, military, police, staff of local NGOs and government humanitarian workers, host community (A report to be shared soon). Fear of reporting and lack of awareness continues to impede provision of services, while safety and security remains a major concern for survivors who develop confidence to report.  

Security and access: General security situation remains fluid and unpredictable. The Nigeria Defence Forces (NDF) counter insurgency initiatives continue with active fighting at the border areas with Cameroon and Chad in the bid to root out the Boko Haram insurgents. The group (BH) though fragmented remains resistant and continues to wage asymmetric attacks, most recently in the outskirts of Maiduguri while cases of suicide bombings, attacks on convoys, active shooter incidences all targeting civilians are undermining security and access. As a result there is limited movement of partners, transportation of supplies to enhance services to beneficiaries.  

Sudden Displacements and Population Movements: The state government of Borno has reversed its earlier position to return IDPs to their original homes and has committed to allow for dignified and voluntary returns in line with the provisions of the Kampala Convention. However, reports of population movement due to different triggers such as military operations continue to raise key gender specific protection concerns especially for women, girls and children. For instance, between 21st to 27th March 2017, 874 new arrivals were registered in Dikwa, while Jere registered 553 and 1,114 in Ngala among other areas (DTM ETT Report Week 7).

Extreme levels of violence and destruction have characterized the on going insurgency in North East Nigeria. The conflict between the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Boko Haram group has widely affected the population in the states of Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, Gombe, Bauchi and Taraba. As the conflict intensified, women, girls and children have disproportionately been affected and the prevalence of gender-based violence has drastically increased. Reports indicate that over 40% of the health care infrastructure has been destroyed by the conflict raising serious reproductive and other health concerns for women and girls. The humanitarian needs for life saving Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) interventions are identified as needing urgent attention and prioritization beyond what the current response is able to meet. 

Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, the most affected states are located in the Lake Chad basin that is experiencing environmental changes and looming famine thereby leaving 1.4million people struggling with food insecurity. In Borno, as the rainy season approaches, there is looming situation of floods that threatens to cut off some Local Government Areas (LGAs) from accessing humanitarian assistance. This is in addition to disease outbreaks such as measles, meningitis, lasser fever and the potential for cholera outbreak during the rainy season as well as other crisis triggers such as the fire outbreaks in Konduga that affected thousands of people. Women and girls pay the heaviest price during such crisis situations as their coping capacity is over stretched in a context where the conflict has weakened and eroded the protection systems leading to their increased vulnerability to abuse and violence. The potential to minimise the risks of and vulnerability to GBV and Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) and provide quality multi sector care for survivors is critical.

**Situational Overview**

The release of 82 Chibok girls: On 7th May 2017, as the sun was setting and the evening dawned, Nigerians especially in the northeast were graced with the news of the release of 82 former Chibok schoolgirls by the Boko Haram insurgent group. This followed a long period of negotiation between the Boko Haram militants and the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, also facilitated by key actors such as the ICRC. Of the 276 girls kidnapped on the night of 14–15 April 2014, 57 escaped in the immediate aftermath and 219 girls were taken as captives and went through several forms of violence including forced marriage, rape, physical and emotional violence among others. The Federal government initially secured the release of 21 former Chibok schoolgirls in October 2016 and rescued 3 others during different operations. While all the 106 returned former Chibok schoolgirls are now receiving rehabilitation under the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development (FMoWASD), supported by key partners like UNFPA, UNWomen and UNICEF; the GBV SWG continues to advocate for the unconditional release of thousands of women and girls that have been abducted and are still being held captive by the Boko Haram.  

Population Movements: Reports of population movements due to different triggers such as military operations and spontenous refugee returns continue to raise key gender protection concerns especially for women, girls and children. On 31st May 2017 for instance, IOM, MSF and OXFAM confirmed a total of 1.083 (150 men, 224 women, 322 boys and 387 girls) new arrivals to Pulka alone. Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps such as Pulka, Banki and Gwoza have been overwhelmed with huge numbers of new arrivals and are at risk of over congestion. Key resources in these areas have been over stretched and IDPs lack basic necessities such as water, food and shelter among others. While some few GBV partners are working to meet the unique gender needs of the IDPs, the Inter Sector Working Group (ISWG) has estimated that about 20,000 IDPs require relocation.  

Heavy Rains & Sand Storms: Heavy rains and sandstorms in the month of MAY completely destroyed 294 emergency shelters, 27 Makeshift shelters and partially damaged 241 emergency shelters in 20 IDP sites. The damages affected a total of 3,429 individuals across eight IDP sites in Jere, five IDP sites in Kaga, three IDP sites in Konduga and four IDP sites in Maiduguri. Among the facilities destroyed include women and adolescent girls safe spaces and Reproductive Health including family planning facilities.",4594,"Gender"

Between January and June, the GBV sub sector has made progress of 38% towards achieving its strategic objectives within the HRP, reaching 376,481 individuals out of 1,000,000 targeted. During the reporting period, 180,783 individuals (42,460 girls, 16,610 boys, 94,974 women and 26,659 men) were supported to access specialized services, out of which 14,071 women and girls of reproductive age were provided with critical materials assistance such as dignity kits and wood fuel for cooking among others. 

158,887 women, men, girls and boys received Psychological First Aid plus other psychosocial support services, and 1,593 mainly women and girls were supported with a range of skills building and livelihood support services. 248 individuals, mostly women, adolescent girls and children received lifesaving medical care including post rape/sexual assault clinical treatment. 11,454 women, girls and boys at risk of or have survived violence benefitted from existing safety and security measures including 30 female and youth friendly safe spaces in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe; and one safe shelter facility for sexual violence/assault and other GBV survivors in Adamawa state. Key advocacy initiatives have resulted into collaboration with the security sector to organise escorted movements for especially females to collect firewood outside the camp security perimeter.  

Overall, although there is huge room for improvements and to perform better. Tremendous progress has been registered towards achievement of targets for indicators contributing to strategic objectives 1 and 2 where implementation data has been available. Strategic objective 3 has registered the least progress because of existing gaps in human resource.

2378764,"Women’s Participation in Peace Processes: Colombia *Blog Post by Jamille Bigio, Rachel Vogelstein, and Anne Connell*

***A new CFR Interactive Report presents compelling evidence about the value of women’s contributions to peace processes around the world. The Peace Process Series is a collection of in-depth case studies of current and past peace processes that offer insight into how women participate in peace processes—whether in official negotiating roles or through grassroots efforts—and why their inclusion advances security interests.***

Last week, Colombia marked the one-year anniversary of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), which ended [fifty years of armed civil conflict](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/colombias-civil-conflict) that resulted in over [two hundred thousand deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/colombia-conflict-death-toll-commission) and the displacement of nearly [seven million people](https://s3.amazonaws.com/unhcrsharedmedia/2016/2016-06-20-global-trends/2016-06-14-Global-Trends-2015.pdf) across the country. Here is a look back at how Colombian women participated in the peace negotiation and the contributions that they made to this landmark agreement.

**Women’s Role in the Peace Process**

The 2016 comprehensive peace agreement set an international example for women’s involvement. When formal talks opened in Cuba in November 2012, only [one of the twenty](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/Gender-and-the-Role-of-Women-in-Colombia-s-Peace-Process-English.pdf) negotiators was female. In 2013, civil society leaders organized a [National Summit of Women and Peace](http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/5/women-build-peace-in-colombia) to demand an inclusive peace process, and by 2015, women comprised 20 percent of the government negotiating team and 43 percent of FARC delegates (a level consistent with the percentage of women fighters in the guerrilla group). Women also contributed to the peace process at all levels, including through official subcommissions—notably the first-ever Gender Subcommission—and through influential roles in the government’s Office of the High Commissioner for Peace. Women’s participation on both sides of the formal negotiating table and in civil society helped ensure the success of the years-long Colombian peacemaking effort with the FARC.

**Effects of Women’s Participation**

Broadened the agenda. Women used their seats at the table to address some of the primary grievances of affected communities, including land restitution and the right to justice and reparations for victims. They successfully included provisions in the agreement on the rights of women, girls, and indigenous populations that sought to secure equal access to rural property for women, promote women’s political participation, create measures to prevent gender-based violence, and rebuke amnesty for crimes of sexual violence committed during the conflict.

Negotiated local cease-fires. Over the course of the years-long peace process, women improved the [security situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbU8CPzjnuA&feature=youtu.be) in towns across the country by mediating local cease-fires; convincing guerrillas to lift roadblocks preventing the passage of people, food, and medicine; and negotiating the release of hostages. This mitigated the ongoing cycle of violence and lessened the external pressure on negotiating parties.

Increased accountability. Because of the demands made by female negotiators and civil society members, the FARC undertook [confidence-building measures](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/Gender-and-the-Role-of-Women-in-Colombia-s-Peace-Process-English.pdf) that increased the likelihood of a peace deal, including initiation of an apology process and release of child soldiers. Furthermore, victims of violence perpetrated by both sides of the conflict—including thirty-six women in a landmark intermediation—offered direct testimony to formal negotiators, securing the issue on the negotiating agenda.

Built public support. Women in civil society organizations played an instrumental role in building coalitions and [rallying public support](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/Gender-and-the-Role-of-Women-in-Colombia-s-Peace-Process-English.pdf) for the commencement and continuance of talks. They repaired relations in communities torn by the conflict, laying the groundwork for the peace-building efforts necessary for the agreement’s long-term success.

**Post-Conflict Status**

The peace agreement with the FARC addressed many issues critical to Colombia’s [post-conflict recovery](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-peace/colombias-farc-rebels-turned-in-more-than-8000-weapons-u-n-idUSKCN1AV2HN), but delays in its implementation have led to rising tensions ahead of the 2018 elections. Following the FARC’s successful disarmament, one of the next tests of the peace deal is the [reintegration](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56208#.WjWSK9-nHIV) of thousands of FARC militants into civic life, including women members: although 40 percent of the FARC (and 25 percent of the ELN) is female, the government historically has provided little support to demobilized [female combatants](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/09/farc-deal-female-fighters/501644/). Another test is transitional justice: Colombia’s new war tribunals will prosecute human rights violations committed during the brutal decades-long civil war, and in a step that reflects progress toward women’s inclusion in public life, female judges will assume [more than half](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-women-rights/gender-justice-women-judges-to-dominate-colombia-war-tribunals-idUSKCN1C324M) of the new court’s seats (27 of the 51 positions). In political life, women continue to play prominent roles, including as the FARC’s 2018 nominee for vice president, and as members of a committee tasked with monitoring implementation of the peace agreement’s gender provisions. However, the durability of peace remains uncertain, with significant challenges including land reform, illicit drug trade, and insecurity. Meanwhile, in October 2017, the government reached a bilateral ceasefire agreement with the second-largest insurgent group, the ELN, as negotiations proceed toward a separate peace accord.

2375289,"Human rights workshop helps women claim their rights **EDWARD BENJAMIN KARGBO** 

Internally displaced people living in the United Nations protection site in Bentiu are claiming back their human rights.

A workshop organized by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and partner organizations for women who have sought sanctuary in the protection site in the Unity region is equipping the women with knowledge of their basic human rights.

Mary Nyanyok Wuar, a leader for a woman’s group in the UN protection site, said the training has taught them a lot about human rights and domestic violence.

Mary fled her home in Nihaldu village three years ago to escape violence.

“When we first arrived here, we did not know about human rights and domestic violence. But through workshops and other engagements with the UNMISS’ Human Rights team and other organizations, we now know what our rights are and where to report if anything happens,” said Mary.

As a leader, one of Mary’s roles is to support and advise other women in the protection site. She says they have been able to work together to form groups that provide support to women.

Domestic violence remains a concern in the UN protected site which is currently home to more than 114,000 internally displaced people – the majority of which are women.

Mary said she believes that men also need to be continuously informed and educated about human rights and abuses against women.

“The men need to be fully onboard when it comes to domestic violence and other forms of abuse,” she said.

While there has been progress in sensitizing men about domestic violence, Samuel Luny, an officer at Women Aid Vision, a local organization that supports women in the protection site says it is still difficult to get some of the men to understand.

“Some men are getting it and over time they will serve as mentors to other men. Change takes time, but we will get there,” he said

The training and engagement have however enabled women “to claim their rights, said Luny.  

“Through workshops and training, we have got them to learn about their rights and report abuses,” said Luny. “They have also formed groups to support each other.”",4594,"Gender"
2373884,"EU will support Niger with assistance of €1 billion by 2020 *European Commission - Press release*

Brussels, 13 December 2017

Overall EU development assistance to Niger will amount to €1 billion for the period 2017-2020. This was announced by Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica at the Donors' Round Table for Niger in Paris.

At this occasion, Commissioner Mimica stressed: ""Niger is facing numerous challenges and has already demonstrated on many occasions a strong political willingness and leadership to confront those challenges. The European Union will support the country with around 1 billion euros for the period of 2017-2020. Our focus will be on ensuring the delivery of basic social services, while continue addressing the pressing security challenges. One cannot come at the expense of the other. ""

This EU assistance was jointly defined with the Nigerien Government and will help to implement Niger's 2017-2021 Economic and Social Development Plan. EU support will further contribute to strengthening State capacities and the delivery of social services. It will help to boost job creation and economic growth as well as increase food security and resilience and fight against climate change. A particular focus will be put on gender equality, girl's empowerment and education. EU support will also sustain good governance efforts, the reform of the country's security and justice systems, as well as the fight against irregular migration, trafficking and smuggling.

As part of the €1 billion envelope, Commissioner Mimica and the Nigerien Minister of finance, M. Massoudou Hassoumi have signed a first financing agreement of €40 million to increase the EU's support in the sector of nutrition, food security and resilience. They also signed an agreement amounting to €64 million to build hybrid power plants in Agadez and in Gorou Banda. The action is co-financing from the French Development Agency (Agence française de développement), with EU grants worth €21 million.

**Background**

Niger faces major challenges in terms of development, where the population is in dire need of provision of basic services, job creation, rural development and access to energy. EU support to Niger under the National Indicative Programme (11th European Development Fund) amounts to €596 million for 2014-2020. It focuses on four sectors: (1) Food security, nutrition and resilience, (2) Reinforcing State capacities to implement social policies, (3) Security, Governance & peace consolidation and (4) Road access to areas affected by insecurity and conflict risks.

Niger benefits from the full range of European instruments to support its role in maintaining stability in the region, to address the economic, budgetary and humanitarian challenges and to support the country in implementing its national development plan for the benefit of the people of Niger. Niger is the first beneficiary of the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, which aims to address the root causes of instability, irregular migration and forced displacement.

The EU also supports the country in facing instability and insecurity, such as a surge of armed terrorist groups, increased transnational organised crime activities, as well as armed banditry, irregular migration and trafficking. To help tackle this, the EU is supporting Nigerien authorities through our civillian Common Security and Defence Policy Mission EUCAP Sahel Niger with advice and training, in order to strengthen their capacities in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. The EU also committed to support the Joint Force of the G5 Sahel countries (Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad) with €50 million to improve security and cross border cooperation in the region.",4594,"Gender"

World Humanitarian Data and Trends presents global and country-level data-and-trend analysis about humanitarian crises and assistance. Its purpose is to consolidate this information and present it in an accessible way, providing policymakers, researchers and humanitarian practitioners with an evidence base to support humanitarian policy decisions and provide context for operational decisions.  
The information presented covers two main areas: humanitarian needs and assistance in 2016, and humanitarian trends, challenges and opportunities.  

The report intends to provide a comprehensive picture of the global humanitarian landscape, and to highlight major trends in the nature of humanitarian crises, their drivers, and the actors that participate in prevention, response and recovery. The 2017 edition of the report builds on previous iterations of the report, providing an overview of 2016 as well as selected case studies that can be used for humanitarian advocacy.  

There are many gaps in the available information due to the complexity of humanitarian crises. Even the concepts of humanitarian needs and assistance are flexible. There are also inherent biases in the information. For example, assistance provided by communities and by local and national Governments is less likely to be reported. The outcomes and impact of assistance are difficult to measure and rarely reported. Funding data is more available than other types of information. There are also limitations on the availability and quality of data. Further information on limitations is provided in the ‘User’s Guide’.  

The data presented in this report is from a variety of source organizations with the mandate, resources and expertise to collect and compile relevant data, as well as OCHA-managed processes and tools, such as the inter-agency appeal process and the Financial Tracking Service (FTS). All the data presented in this report is publicly available through the source organizations and through the report’s own data set (available through the Humanitarian Data Exchange).  

Further information on data sources is provided in the ‘User’s Guide’.

2373109,"The Women Are Ready: an opportunity to transform peace in Myanmar After four years of negotiation, the Government of Myanmar and some of the Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) signed a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) in October 2015.3 Reflecting on either side of the negotiation table, one conclusion is evident: there were few women participating in the NCA process. The Government's negotiation team, represented in direct talks by the Union Peace-making Working Committee (UPWC), comprised 52 members, of which two were women. In the negotiating team for the EAOs, two of the fifteen-strong delegation in the final stage of the talks, were women.4 Why are there so few women participating in Myanmar's peace process? Why are gender considerations absent from substantive negotiation discussions? Which factors impede the substantive participation of women in peace talks and peacebuilding in Myanmar? How can a multiplicity of stakeholders undertake strategies to foster the meaningful participation of women in Myanmar's peace architecture?

To address these questions, this Discussion Paper outlines the status of women's participation and gender in the Myanmar peace process to date, identifies factors that act as a barrier to their participation, and finally proposes some areas of strategic intervention that could address them. Section 1 looks at the leading stakeholders-Government, Ethnic Armed Organisations, civil society, and international actors-and how they shape the peace process and gender equality more broadly. 

Subsequently, Section 2 details eight key factors that inhibit the participation of women in the peace process and peacebuilding in Myanmar.  

These eight inter-related factors provide insight into the multiplicity of overt and subtle barriers that prevent women from participating in the peace architecture and public spaces more broadly. This Discussion Paper concludes in Section 3 by proposing eight strategic areas of intervention in order to address the underlying factorsdiscussed in Section 2-that inhibit the full and substantive participation of women in the peace process.  

This Discussion Paper is a concise overview, inclusive of key analysis and recommendations, based on extensive research undertaken. This Paper is not exhaustive. It provides a nuanced overview of women's participation in Myanmar's peace process up to the NCA signing ceremony in October 2015. The methodology is explained in Annex 1. This is the first instalment of the PSF's ""Contributions to Sustainable Peace Series"" (see Annex 2 for more information).  

The PSF invites readers to reflect on the ways in which the participation of women is limited in the peace process and how to undertake strategies to counter this exclusion. To foster discussion, at the end of each section are boxes that contain 'discussion starter questions'.",4594,"Gender"
2367874,"""Sima"": The ""Great Equalizer"" Pushes Everyone to Destitution: Gender analysis for drought response in Ethiopia – Somali Region Despite impressive economic growth recorded in Ethiopia over the past decade, chronic food insecurity affects many. The country’s subsistence crop and livestock agriculture is vulnerable to climate change and rainfall variability. The Ethiopian Somali region is one of the regions worst affected. A shortage of rainfall in the region over the past three consecutive years has resulted in huge losses of livestock and internal displacement of people. Although the drought affects everyone, men and women experience the impacts of the drought differently. 

The objective of this gender analysis is to understand the different impacts of the drought on men, women, girls, and boys, and their different coping mechanisms and potentials, in order to design and deliver humanitarian interventions responsive to their different needs. The study was conducted in Somali region, in six kebeles (wards/towns) of six woredas (districts) in the Jarrar, Doolo, and Afder zones.

2362334,"UNHCR study uncovers shocking sexual violence against Syrian refugee boys, men A [study](http://reliefweb.int/node/2339329) commissioned by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, into sexual violence against men and boys in the Syria crisis indicates that this violence may be far more widespread than previously understood.

UNHCR’s study involved several dozen informants and focus group discussions with some 196 refugees in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan and mainly conducted in late 2016. Its main findings were:      
- Sexual violence and torture of men and boys in Syria by multiple parties to the conflict appears to be far more common than previously thought based on discussions with survivors, refugees and informants. UNHCR researchers heard accounts of violence against boys as young as 10, and against men including those in their 80s.     
- Gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence and this vulnerability does not end when people leave Syria. Inside Syria armed groups were reported as the main perpetrators. Outside Syria, the danger is often from opportunistic abuse.     
- Refugee boys in countries of asylum suffer sexual violence at the hands of other male refugees and from males in the local community. The high rates of child labour among Syrian refugee boys (up to 94% males in Jordan) are of particular concern in this regard.     
- Sexual exploitation and blackmail of refugee males in countries of asylum was reported, especially among those working in the informal economy.

Those interviewed for the study provided shocking accounts of what they, or others known to them had experienced. Several spoke of severe and debilitating violence, including weapons being used to sexually assault. Much of this was reported as occurring in detention or makeshift prisons.

“When I was in detention in Syria I was tortured in every possible way. We were 80 persons in one cell with no light for 30 days. We were all naked. At night, they hung us from our hands – they tortured us with electricity to the genitals. They would come into the cell to violate us, but it was dark - we couldn’t see them. All we could hear were people saying, ‘Stop! Don’t! … I thought we would die,” said a gay refugee, identified as Tarek.

Another refugee spoke of the horrors a relative had endured:    

“One of my uncles in Syria was arrested. A few months after he was released from detention, he told us – he broke down, crying in front of us – that there was not one spot on his body that had not been abused by an electric drill. He had been raped… After he was released he stopped eating and became alcoholic. He died from kidney failure.”

Among boys in countries of asylum, one respondent described sexual violence, often by older youth, as happening ‘on a daily basis’. The report quotes a legal aid officer as saying the problem is often referred to as ‘bullying’, but that later it would be found out that sexual acts such as rape were involved. Many boys drop out of school. This is due to bullying and violence, including sexual violence, further compounding the challenge of school attendance among refugee children.

Refugee men and boys working informally reported the refusal of some employers to pay wages until sexual favours were performed. They also spoke of blackmailing through the use of sexually humiliating photos and videos taken on mobile phones.

“These are most disturbing accounts revealing just how grave the risk of sexual violence has become both for women and girls and, as shown by this recent report, also men and boys,” said Volker Türk, UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection. “And it’s clear too that we are faced with a vicious cycle here of little help being available, limited outreach to male survivors, inaccessible services, and a culture of silence – all of which reinforce a myth that this problem is rare.”

UNHCR’s report was undertaken with a view to examining the characteristics, causes and impact of sexual violence against boys and men, and with a view to identifying good practices and other means of addressing the needs of victims of sexual violence. It makes a number of recommendations geared towards humanitarian agencies and others involved in working with refugees. These include the need for stronger prevention strategies, better confidentiality arrangements, protection against reprisals, improved survivor care, and strengthened awareness among humanitarian agencies and staff. The report also recommends that further research be done with a view to more effectively preventing and responding to sexual violence against males in conflict and displacement.

2361624,"Helpdesk Report: Women’s participation in peacebuilding and reconciliation in Iraq **Question**

A rapid review of the evidence available on women’s participation in peacebuilding and reconciliation in Iraq.

**Summary**

This rapid review synthesises data from academic, policy and NGO sources on women’s participation in peacebuilding in Iraq. Peacebuilding will be defined as a ‘range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management and to lay the foundation for sustainable peace and development’, and reconciliation will be included under this term (Khodary, 2016, p. 499). There is a severe lack of focus on women and peacebuilding in the literature, which is mirrored by the limited role women have played in institutionalised peacebuilding in Iraq. Moreover, there is little disaggregation in the literature between the various religions, ethnic groups or class structures and women are categorised together as uniform.",4594,"Gender"
2359194,"A Helpline for GBV Survivors in Nepal Transmits Hope and Support *The National Women Commission in Nepal has established a 24-hour toll free helpline to provide support to survivors of gender-based violence (GBV). If anyone faces GBV, or even witnesses such an incident, they can simply call the number 1145 to receive support for shelter, psycho-social support, child support and legal aid.*

The figures are out for us to see: according to the Nepal Demographic Health Survey 2016, nearly one third of all married women in Nepal have experienced violence perpetrated by their partners, the most common violence being physical and emotional. Thirty four percent of such women have sustained injuries due to the violence.

However, in a country with such alarmingly high numbers of gender-based violence (GBV), the number of women coming forward to report it is quite low. The Survey notes that 66 percent of women who have experienced sexual violence have never even told anyone or sought help to resist and stop the violent. This is not surprising, as legal and psycho-social remedies for GBV survivors is limited, not confidential enough, and even the process of reporting incidents can get cumbersome. The survivors often face social stigma and familial pressures.

But the National Women Commission (NWC) of Nepal is about to change that – by establishing a 24-hour toll-free helpline ‘Khabar Garaun 1145’ (Inform Us) for GBV survivors. Starting from December 10, 2017, anyone can call in and anonymously report their own incident, or even an incident they have witnessed, to receive coordinated and sustained support. The helpline allows GBV supporters to register their complaints, and also connects them to the service providers, including the Nepal Police, One-Stop Crisis Management Center, and civil society organizations (CSOs) that provide shelter, healthcare, legal aid and psycho-social counselling.

This integrated helpline will also introduce an online Case Management System (CMS) that uses technology to register, manage, and track cases referred to service providers. By storing the details of the incident, the CMS will eliminate the need for the survivor to recount the incident on every visit, reducing the risk of re-victimization of the survivor.

A first of its kind in Nepal, the helpline began with a simple idea in 2013. At a World Bank organized Violence Against Women Hackathon, innovators got together to find IT-based innovative solutions to address GBV in Nepal. The three winning applications were combined to create the FightVAW online platform, designed to improve the coordination among GBV service providers in the Kathmandu district. This captured the attention of Mohna Ansari, former spokesperson of the NWC, who saw the platform’s potential to improve GBV response services in Nepal.

Four years later, with support from the World Bank’s Integrated Platform for Gender Based Violence Prevention and Response project, the Commission is ready to launch the helpline. For Ansari, the launch of the helpline marks the culminations of years of hard work. “This is a way forward for Nepali women and GBV victims in general,” she said, “It will help them live a life without fear.”

This principle of addressing gender outcomes strategically and with practical results is also the principle of the South Asia Regional Gender Action Plan. The plan identifies prevention and response interventions against GBV, and offers support to innovative pilots that focus on raising awareness and strengthening response efforts to GBV. As one of its pilot projects, the helpline aims to position itself as a lifeline to transmit hope and practical assistance for GBV survivors. 

While remedial services need to be strengthened and upgraded to ensure best possible care for GBV survivors, an efficient and supportive mechanism to address their pressing concerns is definitely a positive step forward.",4594,"Gender"
2358949,"UNMIL-funded quick impact project on gender sensitive reporting training for journalists in Lofa county The Female Journalists Association of Liberia (FeJAL) trained journalists in Voinjama, Lofa County from 28 to 30 November 2017. The initiative titled: Gender Sensitive Reporting; fairer portrayal of Women in the Media was funded by the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL)’s Quick Impact Project to strengthen the skills of journalists and editors to analyze facts, issues and data from a gender perspective.

The three-day training was attended by 15 male and female journalists from the Foya, Zorzor and Voinjama Districts. Three journalists from neighboring Bong County also attended.

According to FeJAL Coordinator Ms. Siatta Scott Johnson, “the objective of this training is to build the capacity of local journalists in gender sensitive reporting. We are training them on how to report on issues affecting women and how to portray women in the media”, she said.

The training’s methodology was two-pronged with theoretical learning and interactive practical exercises undertaken by the participants. Topics covered include: gender analysis framework for media; gender perceptions and expectations; gender-based violence and ethics; sexual harassment, exploitation and abuse and media advocacy.

At the end of the training, an active participant Mr. Tokpa Tarnue Manager of Radio Kintoma in Voinjama said “I am now better equipped to train my colleagues on the importance and norms of gender sensitive reporting.

This is crucial due to the high number of gender-based violence cases being reported in the county. Secondly, with most female colleagues being Announcers, I would promote their empowerment by considering them for leadership roles such as Editors and Programme Directors”, he said.

Both participants and trainers thanked UNMIL for sponsoring this highly beneficial project. “We appreciate the collaboration with UNMIL and hope we can implement more projects together. Judging from the issues identified during the training in Lofa County, we know there is a lot more to be done in terms of boosting the skills of community journalists,” said Ms. Johnson.",4594,"Gender"
2358389,"USAID Fact Sheet: Gender, November 2017 In Liberia, gender biases result in severe limitations to women’s inclusion at all levels. USAID/Liberia regards gender as a crosscutting theme and works to integrate gender issues across its entire portfolio. We work with government to address gender constraints and promote equitable and inclusive development by promoting access to economic opportunities for women; increasing women’s political participation; and increasing women’s access to critical social services, including education and health.

PROGRAM AREAS:

Education: Access to primary and secondary levels of education, as demonstrated by net enrollment ratios, remains a problem in Liberia. Many social, cultural and economic factors at the household and community levels influence the chances of girls’ enrollment and retention in school. USAID assistance in education reduces the gender gap in educational institutions by increasing enrollment and safe access. Through teachers’ training, prevention of gender-based violence, support for the education of disabled and out-of-school adolescent girls, USAID addresses barriers to girls’ advancement. Additionally, USAID provides an array of opportunities for girls and women, including positive messaging through media; engagement with traditional authorities; and capacity-building with school boards, parent teacher associations and other local structures to become advocates for increased access in their communities and to build community coalitions in support of girls’ enrollment and retention in school. 

Economic Growth: USAID assistance in the agriculture, natural resource management and infrastructure sectors improves women’s access to technology, credit, information, and income-generating opportunities. Agriculture activities are focusing on input supply (seeds and fertilizer), post-harvest processing, and increasing access to finance, particularly through village savings and loan associations. In the area of natural resources management, USAID supports women to increase their voice in community forestry and forest enterprise development, through capacity development, advocacy support, and technical training. Similarly, through infrastructure activities, USAID is supporting the Ministry of Education and other partners in expanding the Liberia School for the Blind to include a separate dormitory and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities for adolescent girls.  Investments in rehabilitating rural roads reduce travel times by more than half for many women and girls, thereby allowing them to safely visit health clinics and attend school.

Health:  Through its health programs, USAID improves the health status of women and girls by increasing access and availability of essential services through gender-specific messages. Liberia’s high rate of teen pregnancy is being addressed through awareness campaigns, radio spots and jingles as well as market-based distributions of contraceptives targeting adolescent girls. Additionally, family planning services will continue to focus on male involvement and adolescent reproductive health both at the community level and at health facilities. Through gender sensitive HIV/AIDS information, education, and communication materials, we aim to address the substantial gender gaps in knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention.  By supporting reproductive, maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition services that are accessible, affordable, and high quality, USAID improves the health status of all Liberians, particularly women, and reduces maternal and child mortality.

Democracy and Governance: USAID integrates and focuses on gender and women’s empowerment through its democracy and governance programs. USAID supports government and civil society counterparts in their efforts to improve outreach to women, increase women’s participation in the political process, and enhance women’s roles in good governance. USAID also focuses its efforts to improve human and institutional capacity for gender responsive land governance policies.  USAID supports media programs on gender sensitization and integration in the workplace, including mentoring to promote equitable work assignments and advancement to editorial and management positions.",4594,"Gender"
2357469,"UN and local authorities call for an end to violence against women in Bahr el Ghazal *MANYANG MAYOM*

Local authorities have joined forces with the United Nations in the Bahr el Ghazal region to combat violence against women during a 16-day international campaign dedicated to eliminating gender-based violence.

Many women in communities like Tonj, Gogrial and Twic in the north-west of the country are suffering from physical and sexual violence because of the ongoing conflict.

In Tonj, women have been restricted by authorities from moving around at night as a precautionary measure against harassment. Tonj Governor, Akec Tong Aleu, said this decision was made after a number of cases of sexual assault.

“There was no quick solution that could be found to save women from harassment at night,” he said. “The quickest solution was to impose a ban on women and girls walking at night.”

The head of the UN Mission’s field office in Kuajok, Anastasie Nyirigira, is urging political, community and youth leaders to come together to prevent and eliminate violence against women in their homes and in their communities more broadly.    

“We need to stop impunity. We need to stop what I would call being insensitive to all the violation we see around us. I am looking at cases of rapes. I am looking at limited enrolment of girls in school. I am looking at limited participation of women in positions of leadership, decision-making, and, worst of all, I am looking at early and forced marriage as practices that we need to end,” said Anastasie Nyirigira.  

Gogrial Legislative Assembly Speaker, Atong Manyual Lual, called for greater respect for the law relating to issues like marriage to underage girls, which is banned in South Sudan. She also appealed for greater awareness about violence against women and respect for their rights, including to education.

“We have duty whether in government decision-making positions or as traditional leaders to protect women and girls in our societies so that we achieve a better South Sudan that is free from violence,” she said. “Peace that starts from your house is a peace that spreads to everyone in the family and then to nation.”

Gogrial Governor Victor Atem Atem, pledged to work closely with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan to prevent the escalation of conflict in the area so that women and girls will no longer be exposed to violence",4594,"Gender"
2355464,"Gender & Localising Aid: The potential of partnerships to deliver This report, the result of internal research by CARE International, argues that partnerships in humanitarian response not only meet lifesaving needs but can also address gender inequalities. Based on the review of five recent emergency responses, the report explores which partnership models and practices can best foster gendertransformative humanitarian action. 

**Gender dimensions**

CARE’s focus on women and girls is based on overwhelming evidence of gender discrimination as an underlying cause of poverty and marginalisation, leading them to being more vulnerable to the effects of disasters than men and boys. Humanitarian programming that fails to account for the differing roles and power dynamics between men and women tends to exacerbate gender inequalities. At the same time, disasters often disrupt and displace social structures and relations, creating opportunities to promote gender transformational change, such as women taking on leadership roles in their household and community during relief and recovery. While urgent, lifesaving action is critical in crisis response, CARE firmly believes that gender-sensitive action is essential to an effective response. CARE is also convinced that humanitarian action can advance gender equality and transformation. 

**Partnership and Localising Aid dimensions**

Partnerships are fundamental to CARE’s work. CARE believes that saving lives in emergencies, and overcoming poverty, can only be achieved through the collective action of many. CARE has long promoted working with local institutions in development settings and is increasingly partnering in emergencies. CARE recognises that partnering with local actors leads to greater reach and sustainability as they are often the first responders when disaster strikes, with best access to local populations, intimate knowledge of the local context, and long-term presence. CARE believes that localised aid is not only more effective but also just and fair. As such, CARE advocates for more operating space and resources for local actors and disaster-affected communities. CARE recently strengthened its commitment to localising humanitarian aid by endorsing the Charter for Change and the Grand Bargain2 , espousing the call to ‘reinforce – not replace – existing local and national capacities.’ This approach compels CARE to move away from subcontracting towards more equitable, powersharing partnerships, viewing local civil society as peers with common visions and purposes.",4594,"Gender"
2353864,"Provisional application of new agreement between the European Union and Afghanistan signals new phase in cooperation From 1 December 2017 the Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development (CAPD) between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan will provisionally apply. This agreement, which was signed by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini and the Afghani Minister of Finance, Eklil Hakimi on 18 February, represents the first ever legally-binding framework for relations between the EU and Afghanistan. 

The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini said: ""We are entering into a new phase of our cooperation. Our new agreement will allow the European Union to better support Afghanistan and the Afghan people, through working even more closely together. The agreement complements the new strategy on Afghanistan that our Union has just adopted, where we look at peace, security and development of the country as our shared priorities. It is a partnership agreement by name and by nature; it shows that the European Union will continue to stand by Afghanistan and Afghan people.”

Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica added: "" At the October 2016 Brussels Conference, the European Union as a whole made the largest pledge of €5 billion to support Afghanistan's development agenda up to 2020. Today we confirm our engagement to be a strong partner of Afghanistan in its reform efforts. Our new agreement will give further impetus to our cooperation in a range of key areas such as development, gender equality, trade and investment and regional cooperation. The European Union will continue its support for a peaceful and prospering Afghanistan and to the benefit of the Afghan people.""

The provisional application of the agreement, which was made possible by both the European Union and Afghanistan having completed the necessary internal procedures, will cover cooperation in a number of important areas, inter alia human rights, gender equality, development cooperation, trade and investment matters, migration and regional cooperation. A regular political dialogue will be established for Afghan and EU leaders to discuss issues of common interest, address challenges and create opportunities for a stronger partnership. 

The provisional application of the Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development will also allow the establishment of a Joint Committee that will ensure the proper functioning and implementation of the areas of the agreement that are provisionally applied. Two special working groups will also be created in order to further strengthen work on human rights, good governance and migration, and on economic and social development. The first meeting of the EU-Afghanistan Joint Committee will take place in early 2018. The agreement will enter into force once all EU Member States have ratified it.

2351399,"No safe place: A lifetime of violence for conflict-affected women and girls in South Sudan As part of the What Works to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls consortium, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), the Global Women’s Institute at the George Washington University (GWI) and CARE International UK sought to obtain rigorous data on the prevalence, forms, and drivers of VAWG in South Sudan. The study used quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the situation of women and girls in ve settings in South Sudan: Juba City, Juba County, Rumbek Centre, two Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites in Juba, and one PoC site in Bentiu. The household survey was conducted in three sites: Juba City, Juba PoCs, and Rumbek Centre. By using local partners trained to accurately and sensitively gather data from women, men, girls and boys across multiple diverse settings, the researchers were able to provide quantitative evidence demonstrating the widespread and severe nature of both non-partner and intimate partner violence, in addition to qualitative evidence that tells a clear story of the lifetime of violence women endure and the devastating consequences for their health and wellbeing.

**Results**

The study found that VAWG is pervasive in these con ict zones with up to 65% of women and girls experiencing physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime. These are among the highest rates of VAWG in the world.

The research results show that up to 33% of women in these areas experienced sexual violence from a non- partner, and many of the incidents were directly related to a raid, displacement or abduction. Women and girls who live in Juba PoC sites are the most vulnerable to this type of assault—almost a quarter of women who experienced this violence reported that they experienced multiple incidents of sexual violence.

While women and girls were often subject to sexual violence by armed actors, they also felt the impact of con ict in a number of other ways. Experiences of displacement, the breakdown of rule of law, increases in crime and the normalisation of violence also a ect VAWG. 

These indirect experiences of con ict have an impact on violence in the home. Intimate partner violence (IPV) was the most common form of VAWG. In Rumbek alone, 73% of women who are or have been partnered reported they experienced IPV in their lifetime. Times of con ict exacerbate IPV, as women reported increased brutality and frequency of assaults due to the chaos and economic insecurity of war.

Long-standing discriminatory practices such as bride price, child and forced marriage and polygamy, in addition to years of war, have created an environment where violence against women and girls is common in these parts of South Sudan, with many subjected to violence at the hands of family members from infancy. Bride price is the custom of a man giving money or cattle in exchange for a girl to marry, a practice that a ects VAWG throughout the lives of women and girls. Many patriarchal practices, such as child marriage, wife inheritance and abduction are all closely linked to bride price.

Most survivors of violence in South Sudan do not seek help after experiencing an assault due to shame, stigma and a culture of silence. A breakdown in the rule of law has also contributed to an environment of impunity where there are no consequences for men who commit acts of violence. To reduce violence against women and girls in these areas of South Sudan, humanitarian e orts need to address the root causes and drivers of VAWG as well as provide direct service delivery to these communities.

**Implications for Action**

**Specific Recommendations for Donors and Policymakers**

- Prioritise funding for specialised VAWG protection programs from the earliest stages of a crisis

- Allocate additional funding to support longer term VAWG programming

- Develop and/or adapt VAWG policies and strategies to ensure they meet global commitments under key VAWG and localisation policy frameworks

**Specific Recommendations for Practitioners**

- Focus on safe spaces for women and girls and informal support structures as part of a VAWG response programme

- Recognise and address the multiple barriers survivors face in accessing services in South Sudan

- Provide targeted training and institutional capacity building to security and legal support services

- Engage with women and girls throughout the programme design and implementation process

**Key Recommendations**

- Prioritise VAWG in all humanitarian action

- Ensure VAWG programming and policy address the multiple forms of violence experienced by women and girls

- Invest in specific programs targeting the unique needs of adolescent girls

- Promote the integration of programs addressing VAWG and community-level violence and long-term peacebuilding

- Fund and deliver gender-transformative programming that addresses discriminatory practices and gender-inequitable norms

- Support women’s groups and the women’s movement to build local capacity to improve the status of women",4594,"Gender"

**1. Introduction**

Better and more meaningful financial inclusion may prove to be the key to unlocking the potential for micro and small enterprises to grow, reducing the exposure of poor and rural communities to income shocks, dynamizing growth, and promoting more sustainable and equitable development. Recent analysis of financial inclusion underscores that where individuals have access to financial services and products, even in poor communities, they are better able to plan and manage their income (Ruiz, 2013) and households are more likely to hold savings and to invest these savings in productive uses(Schaner, 2016b). Controlling for income and sector of employment, households that have access to savings instruments and insurance are better able to withstand economic shocks (Karlan et al., 2014; Janzen and Carter, 2013; Cole et al., 2013); they are also more able to invest in education for their children and purchase healthcare services (Prina, 2015; Dupas and Robinson, 2013a; Duflo, 2012; Bauchet et al., 2011). Communities in which a greater proportion of the members are banked are more likely to have higher incomes (Bruhn and Love, 2014) and experience lower poverty rates (Kast and Pomeranz, 2014; Burgess and Pande, 2005), denser economic activity, stronger forward and backward linkages to productive activities, and more and better employment opportunities (Bruhn and Love, 2011). Indeed, Beck et al. (2007) find that controlling for other relevant variables, 30 percent of the variation in rates of poverty reduction can be attributed to cross-country variation in financial development.  

Better and more meaningful financial inclusion may also foster reduced gender inequalities. Women who have access to bank accounts, savings mechanisms, and other financial services may be better able to control their earnings and undertake personal and productive expenditures (Islam et al., 2014; Alam, 2012; Ashraf et al., 2010). They may also be able to make more choices about how they use their time, whether for employment, leisure, income-generating activities, or education (Field et al., 2016; Bandiera et al., 2013; Aker et al., 2016). They may have more substantive autonomy over their lives in decisions ranging from employment and marriage to whether to use contraception (Holloway et al., 2017; Suri and Jack, 2016; Pitt et al., 2006; Aker et al., 2016; de Brauw et al., 2014; Schuler and Hashemi, 1994). They may be better able to grow their businesses, to choose where and how to work (Field et al., 2016), and to raise their productivity and earnings and reduce their chances of being poor (Suri and Jack, 2016; Swamy, 2014). They may also have more options to leave abusive relationships and experience reduced exposure to intimate partner violence (Panda, 2014; Garikipati, 2008).

Yet untapped opportunities exist to provide a broader array of financial services for the poor and particularly for women. Conventional financial products and services still do not seem to reach the poor and women well. According to the 2014 Global Findex data, 57 percent of women around the world have a financial account, compared to 64 percent of men (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2015). Furthermore, the International Finance Corporation estimates that over 70 percent women-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have inadequate or no access to financial services (Koch et al., 2014). The gender gap has persisted despite the growth in the number of people with access to financial services, and the gap is largest among the poor: poor women are 28 percent less likely than poor men to have a formal bank account (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2013).",4594,"Gender"

“This is a new plan for a new era,” said Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP, at the Executive Board in New York.  “The dramatic changes we see in the world have occurred on such a scale and at such a pace that our institutions are struggling to keep up. More is being demanded of us.”

President of the Board H.E. Mr. Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, said: “UNDP’s new strategic plan marks a welcome new direction for the Organisation to support the realisation of the 2030 Agenda. On behalf of the Executive Board, I welcome today’s endorsement of the plan as an essential tool for UNDP to continue to evolve and adapt over the next four years.”

“The nations of the world have committed to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the UN system has been tasked to support them,” Steiner continued. “This is the driving force of the Secretary-General’s UN reform agenda, and we must rise to the challenge.”

Anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and committed to the principles of universality, equality and leaving no one behind, it sets out a vision for the evolution of UNDP over the next four years, responding to a changing development landscape and the evolving needs of partners. Building on UNDP’s 50 years of experience, it describes how UNDP will support countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and related agreements.

“This plan has been designed to be responsive to the wide diversity of the countries we serve,” Steiner continued.  “This diversity is reflected in the three broad development settings described in the plan: eradicating poverty; structural transformations; and building resilience. It also describes how our two new platforms; country-level and global, will enable UNDP to deliver our support in a more effective way.”  

The plan identifies six “signature solutions” against which UNDP will now align its resource and expertise, to make a real impact on poverty, governance, energy access, gender equality, resilience and environmental sustainability.  

As well as formally endorsing the plan, the Board approved UNDP’s integrated resources plan and integrated budget estimates 2018-2021.

UNDP’s Executive Board is made up of representatives from 36 countries and provides inter-governmental support to and supervision of UNDP activities, ensuring that the Organization remains responsive to the evolving needs of programme countries.",4594,"Gender"

2349099,"Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination considers the report of Jordan [EN/AR] Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination   

24 November 2017

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination today concluded its consideration of the combined eighteenth to twentieth periodic report of Jordan on its implementation of the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

Saja Majali, Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said that the 2016 parliamentary elections had been conducted under the new electoral law which included a system of quotas for ethnic and religious minorities, and for women.  Jordan had the largest refugee population per capita in the world: 29 per cent of the population were refugees, and Jordan had received one in five of all Syrians fleeing the war.  The refugees had been welcomed with an open heart, but such a large number of people was taking its toll: the direct cost amounted to five per cent of the gross domestic product or two billion dollars annually.  The question of Palestinian refugees was a priority, and Jordan continued to provide them with support and services for a decent life in dignity.  In 2014, a decision had been adopted to regulate the rights – including to nationality – of children of Jordanian women married to foreigners.  Ms. Majali stressed that everyone living in Jordan was protected from discrimination and had the right to address complaints of racial discrimination to courts.  Acts of violence or provocation against a person or any group of persons were a crime, and propaganda based on racial discrimination, including in the media, as well as the incitement to terrorism, racial or religious hatred or violence was prohibited by the law.

Committee Experts recognized that the conflicts in the region and related population movements placed an undue burden on such a small country like Jordan and hoped that the international community would provide adequate support.  They welcomed the measures taken to improve the situation of children of Jordanian women married to non-Jordanian men but remarked that they fell short of the Committee’s previous recommendation to grant those children full nationality.  Further on nationality, Experts asked about the situation of Jews and Bedouins, birth registration of children of stateless persons or those without identity documents, the definition of “Arab” in the nationality law, and why the rules governing the acquiring nationality through marriage discriminated against non-Arab women.  The delegation was asked about the border closure for Palestinian refugees wishing to enter Jordan from Syria, the withdrawal of identity cards and nationality from Palestinian refugees under the pretext of maintaining Palestinian identity, and the application of the principle of non-refoulement in the return of Syrian and other refugees.  Experts also asked about the effectiveness of the legal protection from racial discrimination for ethnic and ethno-religious minorities; measures to identify, protect and support victims of trafficking in human beings; and the system in place to ensure the protection of domestic workers who were still being largely employed through the kafala or sponsorship system.

In concluding remarks, Alexei Avtonomov, Committee Rapporteur for Jordan, said that the concluding observations would recognize the positive aspects, and would also stress that the rights under the Convention should be extended to all the people living in the country, regardless of their nationality and citizenship.

Ms. Majali said the rights of non-citizens were respected in Jordan and any limitation of their rights was within the limits of international instruments, adding that in Jordan, diversity was a strength and its unity was the future.

The delegation of Jordan included representatives of the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, Ministry of Labour, and the Permanent Mission of Jordan to the United Nations Office at Geneva.

The Committee will reconvene in public on Monday, 27 November, at 10 a.m. to hold an informal meeting with non-governmental organizations on the reports of Australia, Slovakia and Belarus, which will be reviewed during the week.

Report

The Committee has before it the combined eighteenth to twentieth periodic report of Jordan (CERD/C/JOR/18-20).

Presentation of the Report

SAJA MAJALI, Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said that despite the wars, conflicts and other unfolding challenges in the Middle East, Jordan was committed to the promotion and protection of human rights.  The parliamentary elections in September 2016 had been conducted under the new electoral law which guaranteed fair representation of political and social forces in the parliament through a system of quotas for ethnic and religious minorities and women.  A package of legislative amendments had been adopted to strengthen the political life and ensure the participation of political parties from all walks of life.  The sixth discussion paper on the rule of law as a basis of civil state had been issued in 2016 and had culminated in the setting up of a Royal Commission to promote the judicial system.  A unit for human rights had been set up in the Office of the Prime Minister to monitor the implementation of legislation and propose necessary amendments, while the National Human Rights Plan 2016-2025 aimed to strengthen the protection of vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities.

Jordan had the largest refugee population per capita in the world, with 29 per cent of the population being refugees.  Since the beginning of the war in Syria, Jordan had received over 1.3 million Syrian refugees, or one in five people who had fled this country; of those, only 10 per cent resided in refugee camps and the rest were in communities.  The refugees had been welcomed with an open heart, but the arrival of such a large number of people was taking its toll in a number of areas, including employment and access to services.  The education system had seen a surge in the number of Syrian pupils who now represented 12 per cent of the student population and, despite efforts to increase the capacity, 47 per cent of the schools remained overcrowded.  The direct cost of this refugee crisis amounted to two billion dollars per year, or five per cent of the gross domestic product, said Ms. Majali, and urged the international community to honour the commitments and pledges to provide resources and support for the refugees.  Although it had already surpassed its absorption capacity, Jordan was committed to continue to fulfil its humanitarian obligations and commitments.  Free of charge health care was being provided to women victims of gender-based violence, including refugee women.  A shelter for victims of violence in the northern part of the country had been opened last year, and all refugees enjoyed access to justice. 

The question of Palestinian refugees was a priority for Jordan, said Ms. Majali, stressing the need to a just and lasting solution to the issue of Palestine in accordance with United Nations resolutions.  Jordan continued to provide support and services to the Palestinian people in Jordan to enable them to live decently and in dignity.  The budget for Palestinian refugees in Jordan was 10 times that of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.  The Palestinian refugees in Syria were the responsibility of that State and the international community, stressed Ms. Majali, noting their right to return to their homeland in line with international law.  Jordan had adopted in 2014 a decision on the rights of children of Jordanian women married to foreigners, ensuring their free access to health and education, access to profession of their choice and a position in the public administration.  Over 70,000 identity documents had been issued to such children, and they had access to 150 university seats.  They had access to the citizenship in accordance with the law.  All individuals living in Jordan were protected from discrimination and had the right to address complaints of racial discrimination to courts.  Acts of violence or provocation against a person or any group of persons were a crime; propaganda based on racial discrimination, including in the media, as well as the incitement to terrorism, racial or religious hatred or violence were prohibited in the law.

Questions from the Country Rapporteur
  
ALEXEI AVTONOMOV, Committee Rapporteur for Jordan, noted that Jordan’s core document dated back to 1994 and needed to be updated with fresh information.  Jordan had taken a number of positive steps since its last review, including the adoption of the National Human Rights Plan 2016-2025 and the appointment of the Coordinator for Human Rights in 2014 – what was the role and the mandate of this position in relation to racial discrimination? 

Jordan was a party to a number of international and regional human rights instruments, including the Cairo Declaration of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Arabic Charter of Human Rights – could the delegation describe the cooperation of Jordan with the Independent Commission for Human Rights of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation?  Were statistics and disaggregated data available on discrimination cases, including in the field of education in connection with the Chechens and Circassians?

The majority of the population were Muslims, while two-thirds of Christians were Orthodox Christians; there were also Greeks and Catholics, and some ethno-religious groups such as Armenians or Yazidis.  Was there legislation in place which allowed persons without a religion, or persons belonging to non-monotheistic religions such as Hinduism, to keep their personal status, which in Jordan was linked to a religion?

Turning to the situation of Palestinian refugees, the Rapporteur noted that there were 158,000 Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and 600,000 from the West Bank, and raised the issue of inadequate conditions in camps, and the lack of travel documents.

What were the measures in place to identify and protect victims of human trafficking, how many prosecutions had been undertaken and what sentences had been awarded?  Raising concern about the vulnerability of refugee children to trafficking in persons, the Rapporteur asked about the sentences prescribed for trafficking a child for purposes of sexual and labour exploitation?

Questions from the Committee Experts 

An Expert asked about the laws and measures that protected the rights of domestic workers and also protected them from abusive practices, and the steps to safeguard their fundamental rights.  Was there an office which registered domestic workers and regularly monitored their working conditions? 

With regard to the situation of refugees, could the delegation provide information on the closure of borders and the application of the principle of non-refoulement, and whether there were any obstacles to arrival to Jordan of Palestinian refugees from Syria?

What training programmes were in place for civil servants, law enforcement officers, judiciary and other State institutions to combat racial discrimination?  How effective was the legal protection from racial discrimination for ethnic and ethno-religious minorities? 

GUN KUT, Committee Rapporteur for Follow-up to Concluding Observations, recalled that Jordan had not submitted its follow-up report on the three issues that the Committee had identified during the previous review, which included the availability of ethnically disaggregated data, the amendment of the nationality law to allow Jordanian women married to non-Jordanian men to transmit the nationality to their children, and the signing of the declaration on article 14 of the Convention.

Another Expert took up the issue of nationality and remarked that it was still accorded to now-Jewish Palestinian refugees who resided in Jordan during the 1949 to 1954 period.  How many Jews lived in Jordan at the moment and what was the situation concerning the Bedouins?  Any Arab having their main residence in Jordan for at least 15 years and who had renounced the nationality at birth qualified for Jordanian nationality – what was the definition of “Arab” in this context?  Nationality through marriage was a stumbling block: a woman could acquire nationality through marriage in three years if she was an Arab and in five years if she was a non-Arab.  What was the process in place to enable children of all Jordanian mothers to acquire the nationality more easily?

A Committee Expert remarked that the situation of Jordan had never been easy as it found itself in a region in which conflicts and movements of populations placed an undue burden on such a small country, and hoped that the international community would provide Jordan with adequate support.  Turning to the legislative and institutional framework, the Expert stressed the need to ensure the domestication of the provisions of international treaties, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in order to ensure their applicability in practice.  Jordan was very progressive in the matter of rights of women, therefore it was surprising that the children of Jordanian women married to non-Jordanian men could not transmit their nationality to their children. 

Could the delegation explain the birth registration of children of stateless persons, children of refugees and children of refugees not registered as such?

Other Experts noted that the recent constitutional amendment had ensured the separation of powers in the State and asked whether this had not been the case prior to the amendment. 

There were instances in which identity cards and nationality were being withdrawn from Palestinian refugees under the justification of the need to maintain the Palestinian identity – could the delegation explain?

What role did the Constitutional Court play in the protection of human rights and in particular protection from racial discrimination?  How many complaints of racial discrimination in one form or another had been lodged in courts and what were their outcomes?

What was the legal and ethical value of the Jordanian National Charter which declared equal rights for women and men, particularly in the context of the Constitutional provision which granted equality before the law on the grounds of ethnicity, language or religion but not on the grounds of sex?

In the context of the law on nationality, were the Palestinians considered to be “foreigners”?

International conventions had supremacy and precedence over all the laws in Jordan except the Constitution, which opened a question on how the conflicts or contradictions between articles of the Constitution and international treaties were resolved?  Was there a possibility to invoke articles of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in Jordanian courts? 

Domestic work was regulated by the kafala or the sponsorship system – what protection was provided to domestic workers by the Labour Code or other instruments, and how could domestic workers enjoy their basic work rights such as to paid leave?

There were reports of Palestinian refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria being stopped at the border - what was the justification for excluding this group from international protection which Jordan granted to all other refugees?

ALEXEI AVTONOMOV, Committee Rapporteur for Jordan, raised a question on the situation of the Dom people, or the Jordanian Roma. 

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation took the floor to answer the questions asked by the Committee Experts, and stressed that Jordan was proud of the progress it had made in the field of human rights, despite the challenges in the region.  Jordan had adopted the National Human Rights Plan of Action and 30 per cent of the items it contained had already been implemented, for example, it had amended article 308 of the Criminal Code and had developed the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Code of Civil Procedure. 

With regard to the Coordinator for Human Rights, it was an initiative that had been recently launched, and it was proof of the level of commitment to human rights by the executive branch.  The mandate included the coordination of efforts by governmental institutions and dealing with non-governmental organizations active in the area of human rights.  Since the establishment of this post, a working group had been set up made up of 120 liaison officers from all public institutions; the group monitored the activities and progress in the field of human rights and produced quarterly reports with their recommendations.  The Coordinator for Human Rights and the liaison officers were in charge of preparing measures for the implementation by the National Human Rights Centre.  

As for the possible discrepancies between the Constitution and international conventions, the delegation reiterated the supremacy of the Constitution in the domestic legislation.  Jordan had not identified any explicit or tacit contradictions between the Constitution and the international conventions that it was a party to.

The Ministry of Labour had issued guidelines on the employment of domestic workers, and it monitored recruitment offices and agencies which could be closed down for failure to follow the guidelines; to date, nine offices had had their licences suspended and had been closed down.  A shelter was in place where domestic workers could go to if they experienced problems at work, and efforts were ongoing to reduce the number of working hours from 10 to eight.  An office was in place where domestic workers could submit complaints against abuse or violation of rights by the employer; the office had the capacity to receive complaints in six languages.

A department had been established within the Ministry of Interior to address trafficking in human beings.  In 2016, there had been 324 complaints which had been referred to the public prosecutor, and a total of 27 cases had been opened.  There were regular training and information activities for the border guards, while the Federation of Jordanian Women was active in providing services and support to victims of trafficking and it had supported 375 victims by 2017.  

Child labour could be undertaken in specific areas and in specific professions.  Jordan was free from all domestic work for children, although there were cases of labour by Syrian children.  To date 76,000 such cases had been identified through inspections of establishments that employed children.  Awareness raising campaigns had been conducted and no child could be employed without prior consent by the inspection.

Jordan was finalizing a package of laws and the national strategy to combat trafficking in human beings, and was also developing a data collection system on the phenomenon.  A unit had been set up at the Directorate for General Security to address this crime.  The strategy was based on three pillars: prevention, protection and partnerships.  In terms of prevention, there were training and awareness activities for the professionals and the general public; in the area of protection of victims, a booklet had been produced with a list of available services such as free legal aid; a hot line to receive complaints of crimes, including the crime of trafficking in persons, had been set up; and a shelter for victims had been opened.  In terms of partnerships, Jordan was actively working with its neighbours and the international community on strengthening the capacity and raising awareness about the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings.

Jordan had been hosting Palestinian refugees since 1949 and according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, there were 2.2 million Palestinian refugees in 2017.  More than 440,000 lived in 13 camps across the country, and over 90 per cent were holders of a Jordanian national identification number which enabled them to access all services on a par with Jordanian citizens.  Essential services to Palestinian refugees inside and outside of the camps were supposed to be provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, but given its limited resources, it only provided services to about three per cent, and the shortfall was being made up by the Jordanian State.  The management of the Palestinian refugee camps was the responsibility of the Office of Palestinian Affairs in cooperation with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

Refugees who were holders of a Jordanian national identification number were Jordanian citizens, and those without such a number were issued with a temporary passport to facilitate their freedom of movement.  Jordan imposed no obstacles on issuing of such passports, particularly to Palestinians who lived in the West Bank and were Jordanian citizens.

Further concerning the situation of refugees, Jordan was not responsible for respecting the Convention rights of refugees not on its territory or under its jurisdiction, namely Palestinian refugees in Syria.  This group was the responsibility of the Syrian Government.  Israel, as the occupying power, was under the obligation to allow any person wishing to return to Palestine to return. 

Jordan fully respected the principle of non-refoulement, including in return of Syrian refugees; Jordan always undertook return on an individual basis and following an assessment of the situation in the returning areas in accordance with the law.  Asylum seekers in Jordan and under Jordanian jurisdiction were treated in accordance with national and international law and were provided with the necessary protection. 

With regard to the Rukban refugee camp, Jordan had already exceeded its absorption capacity for refugees but it would continue to provide humanitarian assistance and support with the clear need to ensure its national security and interests.  Jordan would not accept any attempt to make the Rukban camp a Jordanian responsibility; the camp was in Syria and was therefore under the responsibility of the Syrian Government.

The Syrian refugee crisis continued to have a profound impact on the state of the public education system in Jordan, with 170,000 Syrian children enrolled in school in 2016/17.  Thousands of Syrian children still remained outside the school system, and Jordan was actively taking measures to increase the capacity of the education system; through the introduction of a double-shift system in 2016, an additional 24,000 Syrian refugee children were able to attend school.

The Constitution guaranteed the protection of family, women and children, and there were laws which protected domestic workers.  Syrian refugees who were victims of gender-based violence could access services on an equal footing with Jordanian women.  There was a family protection unit in each camp and investigations of violence against women were conducted and perpetrators were being brought to justice.

Questions from the Experts
  
ALEXEI AVTONOMOV, Committee Rapporteur for Jordan, explained that the concern of the Committee for the situation of domestic workers was due to their vulnerability to racial discrimination in general.  What was Jordan’s intention concerning the ratification of the amendment to article 8 of the Convention on the financing of the work of the Committee?  How was Jordan participating in the International Decade of People of African Descent?

Another Expert asked the delegation about the system in place to bring perpetrators of abuse of domestic workers to justice, whether migrant workers could join a trade union, and the number of complaints of racial discrimination lodged with the authorities.  What was the legal implication of the Jordanian National Charter and its relationship with the Constitution?

An Expert noted that social media was being used for hate speech and asked about the measures that Jordan had adopted to deal with this issue.

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation said that workers above the age of 50 had the right to form a trade union.  A tripartite commission was in place and it identified professions in which trade unions could be established.  Migrant workers could form a union with the prior approval of the Ministry of Labour. 

Domestic workers could file complaints to the Ministry of Labour or through a hotline which operated in six languages.  There was a standard employment contract agreed between the domestic worker and the employer, which defined salary, leave and other points, thus the domestic worker knew in advance the conditions of employment.  According to the law, a worker was anyone who carried a professional activity in exchange for a salary, thus domestic workers came under this category.

Everyone in Jordan had the right to freedom of association and to carry out their cultural activities, which were supported by the State.  As for the political activities of ethnic and religious minorities, Jordan had in place a quota system to guarantee their political representation, and their members had a full right to stand for elections.  Ethnic and religious minorities enjoyed their cultural rights fully, had the right to citizenship and could compete for any position in the public sector – many actually held high-ranking positions in the Government.  All the components of the Jordanian society were equal under the Constitution.  The Chechens, Circassians and Armenians had the right to establish schools in their own languages.

All children born to refugees were registered at birth and had the same rights as Jordanian children, including access to education and health services.  Jordan had opened civil status offices inside refugee camps which provided legal information and services to the refugee population, including registration of birth.

On the separation of power, the delegation said that it was flexible and there had to be coordination between the executive, legislative and judicial powers.  This relationship was governed by the Constitution, which had also clearly set out the position of the King in this regard; the King and the Constitution guaranteed the separation of power.  The Constitutional Court had been set up and it had the jurisdiction to examine all complaints against the laws passed in the country and ensure their constitutionality.

The Constitution had made it sure that people had free access to social media networks; hate speech and incitement to violence or to racial discrimination were prohibited by the law enacted five years ago, which criminalized all manifestations of hatred or sectarianism, including in the social media and networks.

The Law on Citizenship conformed to international law and it gave Jordan the right to confer citizenship to anyone it chose; in this, there was no discrimination on ethnic, racial, religious or any other grounds.  The 2014 Cabinet decision amended the law to address the question of children of Jordanian women married to non-Jordanians, which had seen the setting up of an inter-ministerial commission to address the complaints of Jordanian women whose children did not have access to a national identity card.  Jordan had adopted a humanitarian position on the citizenship of a child born to a Jordanian mother of an unknown father. 

In 2011, the Cabinet had requested that a stop be put on the withdrawal of identity cards from Palestinians.  It was important to note that those people had been given nationality for five years; they were not Jordanians and there was no political relationship between this group and the State.  The delegate said that the decision on withdrawing identity cards or nationality was not arbitrary, and it had been in line with the Disengagement Decision of 1988 which aimed to preserve the identity of the Palestinians, until a final solution for the Palestinian question was found.

Further Questions and Answers
  
In the final round of questions, an Expert noted that football was one way to overcome differences, particularly racial differences which were very visible, but there was concern about instances of violence and racism in football – what measures had been adopted to deal with this phenomenon?  What was the proportion of minorities among the prison population?

Every time the discussion addressed the issue of nationality, Jordan answered by pointing to the right to a driving licence, for example in connection with children born to Jordanian women married to foreigners.  For the majority of countries, a driving licence was a measure of the aptitude and driving skills, but in Jordan they were seen as a right; was this document then not being used as a substitute for an identity card, or maybe it went even further than that?

Responding, the delegation said on access to work for refugees that following the London Conference, Jordan had established a system to facilitate the entry into the labour market of Syrian refugees.  To date 74,000 work permits had been issued to Syrian refugees, including over 20,000 to women, and 25 associations had been established to issue work permits in the agricultural field.

A driving licence could be used as a form of an identity document; it could be issued only if the requirements, including the security clearance, were met.  Following the 2014 Cabinet decision, the right to a driving licence had been accorded to children born to Jordanian women married to foreigners, which had not been the case before.

Data on minorities among the prison population was not available.

Concluding Remarks

ALEXEI AVTONOMOV, Committee Rapporteur for Jordan, said that the concluding observations would recognize the positive aspects in Jordan, particularly in the legislative and institutional domain.  They would also stress that the rights under the Convention should be extended to all the people living in the country, regardless of their nationality and citizenship, in accordance with the Committee’s general recommendations. 

SAJA MAJALI, Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said that Jordan was heartened by the praise for its efforts in the area of racial discrimination and refugees, and reiterated that it was respectful of the duty of the Committee to keep pressing on some issues.  The rights of non-citizens were respected in Jordan and any limitation of their rights was within the limits of international instruments, reassured Ms. Majali and stressed that in Jordan, diversity was a strength and its unity was the future.

ANASTASIA CRICKLEY, Committee Chairperson, thanked the delegation and wished Jordan well in its path towards tolerance, peace and freedom.

2349084,"Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women examines the reports of Guatemala Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 

10 November 2017

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women today considered the combined eighth and ninth periodic reports of Guatemala on its implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Ana Leticia Aguilar Theissen, Guatemala’s Presidential Secretary for Women, introducing the reports, said that the Presidential Secretariat for Women had been repositioned in 2016 to align it with the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the national vision Our Guatemala 2032 to advance the status of women in Guatemala and close the gaps between women and men, especially in access to education and employment, equal pay and political representation.  The Secretariat aimed to ensure that gender was a cross-cutting approach in all the State’s policies, including through the development of methodological and technical tools to assist public authorities in ensuring that gender equality was part and parcel of designing and implementing all public programmes.   Guatemala had one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in Latin America and the Caribbean and one of the root causes was a high rate of teenage pregnancy.  Women continued to be poorly represented in politics.  Sexual violence also remained a major concern.

Committee Experts recognized the important challenges that Guatemala continued to face in the wake of the long lasting civil war, and noted that the root causes of this conflict, namely the stark inequality between the few privileged rich and the many poor, and the very high levels of violence, had not yet been resolved.  The delegation was asked why Guatemala did not use the definition of discrimination as prescribed in article 1 of the Convention, and about steps taken to give constitutional recognition to indigenous peoples and recognize Afro-Guatemalans as a category in the next population census.  Experts raised concern about the abusive criminalization of legal activities of women human rights defenders and journalists and the fact that the judiciary seemed complicit with the perpetrators.  What support system was available for pregnant girls and adolescents, especially in ensuring their return to school after the birth of the child and in preventing pregnancies in the first place?  Criminalization of abortion - which was only allowed if the mother’s life was in danger – forced women to seek unsafe termination of pregnancy and, after malnutrition and lack of medicine, was the third leading cause of maternal mortality, Experts said. 

In concluding remarks, Ms. Aguilar Theissen said that this dialogue and the Committee’s concluding observations would be most helpful in strengthening actions in the areas in which Guatemala was still lagging behind. 

Dalia Leinarte, Committee Chairperson, commended Guatemala for its efforts and encouraged it to address various recommendations which the Committee would issue with the purpose of the more comprehensive implementation of the Convention throughout the State party.

The delegation of Guatemala included representatives of the Presidential Secretariat for Women, Ministry for Labour and Social Security, Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance, Ministry of Governance, Congress of Guatemala, Congressional Commission for Women, Presidential Commission for Coordinating Executive Policy in the Field of Human Rights, Presidential Commission against Discrimination and Racism, Human Rights Directorate, and the Permanent Mission of Guatemala to the United Nations Office at Geneva.

The Committee will next meet in public on Friday, 17 November, at 4 p.m. to publicly close its sixty-eighth session.

Presentation of the Report

ANA LETICIA AGUILAR THEISSEN, Guatemala’s Presidential Secretary for Women, said that in the 35 years since the ratification of the Convention, Guatemala had taken substantive steps to strengthen the legal and policy frameworks for the advancement of the status of women, and acknowledged challenges that remained in ensuring the full enjoyment of women’s rights in the country.  The Presidential Secretariat for Women, the key mechanism to advance the status of women in Guatemala, had been repositioned in August 2016 to align it with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and with the national development plan and vision Our Guatemala 2032.  The Secretariat aimed to ensure that gender was a cross-cutting approach in all the State’s policies, including through the development of methodological and technical tools to assist public authorities in ensuring that gender equality was part and parcel of designing and implementing all public programmes.  Another challenge that was being addressed at the moment was constructing budgets for gender equality to ensure the allocation of sufficient financial resources to close the development gaps between women and men, especially in access to education and employment, equal pay and political representation. 

The Presidential Secretary said that more than half of the country’s population – 54 per cent - lived in general poverty, with 58 per cent of women living in general poverty and 28 per cent in extreme poverty.  Women represented the majority of employees in the poorly paid sectors and industries, particularly paid domestic work, agriculture and the private sector; at the same time, 88 per cent of unpaid work was being carried out by women.  As for access to education, 80 per cent of girls of primary school age – those aged seven to 12 - were enrolled in school, while girls’ school dropout was related to the lack of financial resources of their families, girls’ household chores, teenage pregnancy, difficult access to schools, and lack of a possibility to pursue higher level of studies.  In terms of fertility rates, women without access to education and living in poverty continued to have five children on average, the same as in 1995, while for those with education, the number of children per woman dropped to three.  Maternal mortality rates had dropped from 153 per 100,000 live birth in 2000 to 113 in 2013, but remained among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean.  One of the reasons of such an elevated number of maternal deaths was the high rate of teenage pregnancy, which remained among major social and health issues of concerns.  In 2016, there had been 37,000 teenage pregnancies in girls aged 10 to 19, of which four per cent had occurred in girls aged 10 to 14. 

Women continued to be poorly represented in elected and appointed bodies: only two out of 14 Cabinet members were women, and only 22 women were members of the Congress which had 158 representatives.  Progress had been achieved in the judiciary where women held seven of the 13 seats on the Supreme Court.  Sexual violence remained a major concern.  Since the adoption of the law against femicide and other forms of violence against women in 2008 which had recognized femicide as a crime, 1,988 complaints had been registered, of which 200 in 2016.  While child marriage had been taken off the statute books, that was only the first step in dealing with the problem, said Ms. Aguilar Theissen, adding that Guatemala was aware of the need to strengthen regulatory and legal frameworks for the protection of children and girls in particular, especially in the context of early and forced marriages and its links with violence against women and girls and teenage pregnancies.  In rural areas, where poverty and extreme poverty were prevalent, those phenomena prevailed also due to some traditional attitudes and practices that persisted, such as the belief of parents that girls would be better protected in a marriage.

Questions from the Experts
  
A Committee Expert appreciated the progress made in Guatemala and the numerous challenges due to the long lasting civil war that was ended by the 1996 Agreement for firm and lasting peace and the upheavals that the country had suffered since.  The root causes of the civil war had not been addressed, namely the stark inequality between the few privileged rich and the many poor persons, and very high levels of violence.

The Constitution guaranteed the superiority of ratified treaties over national laws, but the definition of discrimination, direct and indirect, and the prohibition of discrimination as contained in articles 1 and 2 of the Convention, were not being fully implemented.  What measures were being taken to ensure that laws had complementary regulations and adequate budgets to ensure they were better implemented?  Could the delegation explain the steps taken to re-activate the efforts on the normative framework on gender equality and measures to reinforce the justice system? 

What was being done to give constitutional recognition to indigenous people, recognize the category of Afro-Guatemalans in future censuses and anti-discrimination laws, and protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons from discrimination and violence?

On access to justice, the delegation was asked whether national reparation programmes for women affected by conflict addressed all women in a culturally appropriate manner, particularly indigenous women, and whether the budget for this programme was sufficient given the significant budgetary cuts in 2016.

Abusive criminalization of legal activities of women human rights defenders was a constant threat and the justice system seemed complicit with the perpetrators of violence.  What had been done to protect women human rights defenders and journalists in accordance to the Universal Periodic Review recommendations that Guatemala had accepted in 2012?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation said that Guatemala had made significant changes in court rulings in matters covered by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Since 1996, the Constitution contained a principle of equality, which had been used as a basis to all matters on gender equality, said another delegate.  There were gender units and departments which applied the principle of gender equality in ministries, the judiciary, prosecution, and other areas of public action.

Discrimination was criminalized and as a result, all indigenous people and Afro-descendants were recognized.  After many years, Guatemala was implementing procedures for a census and an intervention had been made with the census committee to ensure that adequate gender-related data was going to be collected.  A law on indigenous people and Afro-descendants was being developed, together with the national policy for its implementation, in consultation with indigenous people.  There was an annual congress on promoting the rights of people of African descent, which was linked to the International Decade for People of African Descent.

Entrenched attitudes towards discrimination, particularly among the State’s officials, including in the judiciary, represented a barrier.  This was why the Presidential Secretariat for Women was fully committed to raising awareness about the Convention and rights of women, which so far had not been sufficiently done.

In 2016, the President had made a firm commitment to set up a body for the protection of journalists.  This year, the budget was being allocated for the protection of journalists, and it was hoped that shortly, Guatemala would be able to present proactive measures to protect those who were active in the protection of the rights of Guatemalan people. 

Guatemala was very happy to see civil society organizations becoming more vocal in defending the rights of people.  A specialized justice system was being developed to ensure access to justice to vulnerable persons, for example through the provision of translation and socio-economic support to individuals.  In 2018, an instrument would be put in place to include an ethnically and socio-culturally sensitive approach by the judiciary.

The State was aware that the situation in the penitentiary system required urgent attention.  The reform of the prison system had been underway and a model had been developed which aimed to give a priority to women, and to change the paradigm and the approach from punitive to rehabilitative; this rehabilitation and reintegration model was now being rolled out in four other prisons throughout the country.  Efforts were ongoing to provide greater support to women in detention who had children under the age of four, and improve their conditions of detention.  Additionally, alternatives to detentions were being developed, such as electronic bracelets or the use of guarantees.

The Ombudsman for indigenous women helped them in 14 centres by providing legal, psychological and other forms of assistance.  In 2016, over 3,000 indigenous women had been assisted through this mechanism.

Questions from the Experts
  
A Committee Expert commended the efforts of Guatemala to set up the machinery to advance gender equality taken prior to 2012 and regretted that the mechanisms had suffered serious setbacks due to budgetary cuts during the 2012 to 2014 period.

In order to advance gender equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex, it was crucial to strengthen those mechanisms, increase their capacity, and improve the coordination between them.  What was the budget for the Presidential Secretariat for Women from 2016 onwards, and how would it promote the agenda on strengthening the rights of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of women? 

Why was Guatemala removing the budget of the national coordination office for the prevention of domestic violence against women from the Presidential Secretariat for Women and placing it under the Ministry of Interior?  As of 2016, 32 gender units had been established within ministries and departments, said the Expert and asked about their strategic programme to advance women’s human rights and substantive equality.

In which fields were temporary special measures being applied – or would be applied – to advance the status and situation of Guatemalan women, particularly indigenous women and women of African descent?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegate acknowledged the significant weakening of the gender equality machinery during the previous administration and said that the new Government had undertaken efforts, in cooperation with civil society, to revive the mechanisms.  In 2016, an analysis had been undertaken by the Presidential Secretariat for Women on the basis of which a strategy for gender equality had been put in place, thanks to which gender equality had been taken as an overall goal of development policy.  The Secretariat was now being revamped, and this was a significant challenge.

The Presidential Secretariat for Women was also working on ensuring that financial resources for advancing gender equality were available.  The current budgetary allocation stood at 0.3 per cent of the country’s national budget, and the focus was not so much on increasing it as much as it was on ensuring that the available resources were being efficiently used. 

The Presidential Secretariat for Women had almost finalized the strategy for women with disabilities in cooperation with the National Council for Persons with disabilities, and this would shortly be fully up and running as an official policy in the country.  The work was ongoing on a strategy for sex workers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.  As of this year, the Presidential Secretariat was taking a significant role in planning for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and hoped that gender equality and violence against women would be established as a matter of priority.

In 2016, the first steps had been taken to set up the national coordination office for the prevention of domestic violence against women, which was a difficult process; a strategic plan with timetables and goals was being developed, as well as its legal framework and a mechanism to ensure that the body was sufficiently enforced.

Guatemala indeed faced a challenge in fully understanding the nature and purpose of temporary special measures and putting them in place.  The national system for public information was a real area of weakness and Guatemala wanted to ensure that a mainstream statistics agency which provided gender-relevant data was in place, which could be considered as a temporary special measure.

The institutional bureau for budgeting for gender equality had been recently set up and one if its aims was to identify areas where additional financial resources for gender equality could be raised.  The body was coordinated by the Presidential Secretariat on Women.

In 2016, a dialogue had been opened with civil society on strengthening the institutional architecture and placement of the national coordination office for the prevention of domestic violence against women, and to expand its structure to also include representatives of the prosecutorial and judicial authorities.  Many elected members were against the creation of a separate ministry for women; civil society was also analysing this process and considering alternatives to the mechanism becoming a ministry at the highest level.

Questions from the Experts
  
Despite positive steps taken, Guatemala continued to face negative stereotypes which were at the root of violence against women, and a climate of impunity prevailed, said an Expert in the next round of questions.

What was being done to investigate the tragic event earlier this year in which 40 girls had been killed in a fire in a children’s home, bring the perpetrators to book and reform child protection laws and policies?

How were medical staff being trained to demystify stereotypes concerning disability and stop forced sterilization of women with disabilities?  What mechanisms were in place to protect lesbian, bisexual and transwomen?

Had the efforts to remove gender stereotypes from the curriculum and textbooks been evaluated and had a code of conduct for racial discrimination by the media been put in place?

Another Expert commended steps to strengthen the legal, institutional and policy framework to address and prevent the crime of human trafficking, however, the laws often remained gender-blind.  The weak economic conditions made women and girls, particularly from indigenous communities, vulnerable to internal trafficking, including for labour exploitation. 

What was being done to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Labour and labour inspectors to identify and protect victims of labour exploitation?  What proactive measures were in place to train the judiciary, the police and border officials on gender-sensitive victims’ identification and referral?  What was in place to ensure strict adherence and transparency of adoption procedures and prevent the sale of babies?

There was a high prevalence of prostitution and child prostitution seemed to be on the rise, with girls as young as 12 being forced to serve the clients in brothels where they were kept in conditions akin to sexual slavery.  What was being done to address these problems and ensure that prostitutes were treated as victims and not criminals?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation said that the judiciary was very concerned about the institutionalization of children who were under the care of the State.  The deinstitutionalization process had started in 2015 and currently some 600 children remained in institutions and shelters.  Guatemala apologized for the tragic event in which 40 girls had died in a fire in a children’s home, and said that two Supreme Court magistrates had immediately started the investigation.   

A bill on preventing obstetric violence was being developed, as was the law on sexual violence, and a law on paedophilia.

Guatemala had recently approved a decree which gave the Ministry of Labour more authority to inspect places of work, increase the number of labour inspectors, and also increase the budget.  In 2016, the Ministry had identified 137 children who were exploited for labour.  The first trade union of sex workers in Guatemala had been approved recently, and the Congress had been asked to pass a law regulating sex work in the country.

Guatemala was striving to ensure that women’s issues were a part of the public agenda, including stereotypes which stood in the way of women being truly able to enjoy their rights.  Over the past several years, efforts had been ongoing to influence decision-makers and civil servants from the judiciary and the executive branch, and change attitudes.  Entrenched stereotypes were the major challenge to achieving gender equality, particularly in terms of women’s political and public participation, which contributed to the exclusion and marginalization of women from the public life of the country.  Guatemala was aware that the stereotypes could not be changed before the social and institutional structure that discriminated against women had been removed.

The first phase of the National Action Plan on the implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security had been completed and had seen consultations and the putting in place of the institutional framework. The challenge was in ensuring that the actions requested by the resolution 1325 were internalized by various State and public bodies, and implemented.  The judiciary was being trained on the use of justice for restitution to women victims of the conflict, not only in terms of compensation but also the return of their dignity.

Questions from the Experts
  
In a series of questions on the participation of women in political and public life, an Expert noted that it was very weak and that indigenous women were poorly represented.  At the same time, there were efforts to increase the documentation of women, as seen in the increase of women registered for a vote from 49 per cent in 2010 to 61 per cent in 2014.

Was there universal access to identity documents for all women in Guatemala?  Why was the Congress reluctant to adopt quotas for women in the electoral law?  There were fewer and fewer women in political life – what was being done to encourage the approval of reforms to the electoral law and the law of political parties which would call for parity in electoral lists for women and indigenous people?

The delegation was asked to provide sex disaggregated data on leadership positions in the Foreign Service, and on the participation of Guatemalans in international and regional organizations.

Guatemalan women who opted for the nationality of their husbands lost their nationality unless dual citizenship was allowed by the country of their husband – did this rule apply to Guatemalan men as well?  Could women automatically transmit their nationality to their children? 

How many children were not included in the national register of birth and what facilities were in place to assist indigenous women in registering their children?

Responses by the Delegation

Responding, a delegate said that there were women in ministerial and vice-ministerial positions, and in 2017, 49 per cent of diplomatic posts were occupied by women, including 16 posts at the highest levels. 

As far as the nationality was concerned, another delegate said that a child born to Guatemalan citizens abroad received the nationality automatically.

The struggle to achieve parity in the electoral law and the law on political parties was an important undertaking not only of civil society but of women in the Congress, where out of 158 elected members of the Congress only 26 were women.  Parity had not been achieved while a bill to amend the electoral law was still being discussed.  A framework law to eradicate and sanction political violence in Guatemala was being developed to enable women to stand for elections, and cast their vote, in order to increase the number of women standing for election and being elected during the next electoral cycle.

People in charge of birth registration had to approach the communities, and use their language, which in a multilingual society such as Guatemala was a challenge.  To date, 239 round tables had been organized to identify unregistered children and some 400,000 registrations had been obtained in this way.

A law on gender identity was being developed, to protect the political and civil rights of transwomen who currently, because of the sex change or non-identification with the sex on official documents, did not have the right to vote.

Questions from the Experts

A Committee Expert raised concern about education and asked about the main challenges in an effort to increase school completion rates for girls, and to increase literacy among indigenous women?

There were 13 programmes to prevent school dropout, including support to families, said the Expert and asked whether the efficiency of educational policies and programmes and advocacy efforts to raise awareness of parents about the importance of education for girls, had been assessed.  Were there incentives for parents who sent their daughters to school, and sanctions for those who did not?

What were the results of the 2012 roadmap for caring for pregnant girls and adolescents, and what happened if educational centres refused to accept girl-mothers?  What was the situation with age-appropriate sexuality education, was it included in schools and was it taught by parents to their children?  What access to mainstream education was there for children with disabilities, particularly girls?

On employment, the delegation was asked whether its efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals included increasing access to formal employment and labour markets for women, the strategy to gradually eliminate informal employment, the status of ratification of the International Labour Organization Convention 189 on domestic workers, and whether sexual harassment at work was criminalized. 

What was being done to eliminate child labour and ensure that all children were in school?

The Committee was very concerned about the very high maternal mortality rates and other shortcomings in the health sector, including high malnutrition rates among children in rural and remote areas – 45 per cent according to some reports, while the low resource allocation for health did not allow for the delivery of health care services to the population of which more than half lived in poverty.

Criminalization of abortion - which was only allowed if the mother’s life was in danger – forced women to seek unsafe termination of pregnancy and, after malnutrition and lack of medicine, was the third leading cause of maternal mortality. 

What was being done to reduce malnutrition and especially chronic malnutrition among children, and to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, education and information, as well as contraception?

Replies by the Delegation

Responding to the questions and comments made by the Committee Experts, the delegation said that ensuring bilingual education in a country as diverse as Guatemala was a challenge and reassured the Committee that all efforts were being taken to ensure access for all to culturally appropriate education.  The National Committee for Literacy was in place and was working to ensure that education was provided in 70 Mayan languages.  A three-year-long teacher training programme was in place to ensure that teachers were versed in bilingual and inter-cultural education.

During the 2012 to 2016 period, over 4,000 grants for education of children with disabilities had been allocated.

The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health were working on developing a public policy to restore the dignity of girls following forced pregnancies, which would ensure their return to school and education, as well as reparations and compensation.

The overriding challenge in Guatemala was to understand that chronic malnutrition was a public health challenge which had to be tackled head on in a holistic manner.  The Food Security Council worked on ensuring intervention by different institutions, in a gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate manner. 

On abortion, the delegation stressed the need to hold a dialogue with stakeholders and understand it as a social and public health problem. 

The national economic policy had defined five priorities for the inclusion of women in the economy and women’s economic empowerment.  This issue was the most urgent, and Guatemala was lagging behind, especially given its history of exclusion of large parts of the population.  Efforts were ongoing to identify cornerstones for the economic empowerment of women and to collect statistics and data on women in formal and informal sectors, all in the effort to implement the Panama Declaration which defined a roadmap for Latin America on women’s economic empowerment.

The decent employment policy was in place and it was very supportive of women, particularly those who started their own businesses.

Around 15 per cent of abortions occurred outside of health facilities, and were a major cause of maternal deaths, said a delegate, adding that it was simply not possible to collect detailed data on those deaths.  Guatemala recognized the formal role of midwives who were of strategic importance in delivering material health services in communities throughout the country, particularly in indigenous communities where midwives guaranteed that health services were delivered in a culturally appropriate manner.

Questions from the Experts

Despite the almost three per cent growth in the gross domestic product, a large part of the population - 59.3 per cent, remained poor, said an Expert, noting that women, especially those from disadvantaged groups such as indigenous and Afro-descendants, were affected. 

What was being done to promote female entrepreneurship, including by improving access of women to credit and tax breaks?

Only 23 per cent of housing units were owned by women – what was being done to increase female home ownership?  Had the 2015 gender equality policy improved the access of women to land?

The delegation was asked about the achievements of the 2014-2020 agrarian policy and its impact on rural women, the implementation of the principle of free, prior and informed consent for all foreign investments in indigenous and rural areas, and how refugee and asylum-seeking women were dealt with.  Did the 2016 migrant code respect the principle of non-refoulement and were the persons in charge of its implementation adequately trained?

Responses by the Delegation

In terms of the development mechanism in Guatemala and the public policies and specific measures to improve the situation of rural women and women in the labour market, the delegate reiterated that the country was facing serious structural problems in managing its development and ensuring that all the policies were being actively implemented throughout the country.  This of course had serious implications on the socio-economic development opportunities offered to women in Guatemala.

In the implementation of agrarian policies, Guatemala tried to stress the importance of the political implementation of those measures, and had focused on awareness raising, dissemination of existing texts, and the setting up of mechanisms, but it had not yet looked at the technical implementation of the agrarian policies, which was essential to making headway.

In terms of the implementation of the principle of free, prior and informed consent, the Government had published a guidebook for compliance with the International Labour Organization Convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples.  The Congress was looking at the law on consultations, which would hopefully be put to vote in six months’ time. 

The Government was focused on promoting women’s access to credit and more than 25,000 loans had been given.  Credit opportunities were available for poor families, as well as subsidies for further economic empowerment.

Over 60 per cent of workers were in the informal economy which meant that they were not covered by social protection.  Under its dignified employment policy, the Government was supporting their move to the formal sector, including by introducing more lax conditions, where they could access social protection and benefits.

The water act had been held up in parliament for many years, resulting in a lack of regulation of property of water and access to water, explained a delegate, adding that last year criteria had been defined for public investments in development and water and sanitation had been included.

Questions from the Experts
  
In the next round of questions, the delegation was asked about the legal capacity of girls with disabilities, and who looked after those who were abandoned by their families.

Would the new civil code repeal the provisions which were discriminatory against women, particularly the chapter on family life and marriage, would it remove the concepts such as  “good behaviour” and “orderly life”, and no longer use terminology of “kidnapper and kidnapped” when referring to early marriage.

Responses by the Delegation

In response to the issues raised by the Experts, the delegation said that Guatemala had invested important efforts to raise the age of adulthood for girls and also raise the age of marriage to 18.  The most serious stereotype that persisted in the country at all levels was that the body of a woman was for the pleasure of a man.

Judges determined which girls were authorised to marry, but they faced situations in which many did not speak the same language as the judge and they were often under pressure from their families to marry.  Raising of age of marriage would do away with early marriage and would allow girls themselves, and not judges or the State, to decide when they were ready to marry. 

Penalties would be imposed on anyone responsible for the marriage of a minor.

Plans were underway to create a sex offenders register so that proof was available for any further prosecution.

Concluding Remarks

ANA LETICIA AGUILAR THEISSEN, Presidential Secretary for Women, said that this dialogue and the Committee’s concluding observations would be most helpful in strengthening actions in the areas in which Guatemala was still lagging behind.  The national development policies must be harmonized with international commitments and public policies must be put in practice.  Even though much remained to empower women, certain processes had been put in place, including increasing human rights capacity and data collection, which were essential for decision-making in the public policy.

DALIA LEINARTE, Committee Chairperson, commended Guatemala for its efforts and encouraged it to address various recommendations which the Committee would issue with the purpose of the more comprehensive implementation of the Convention throughout the State party.

2349079,"Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women examines the reports of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women

8 November 2017

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women today considered the combined second to fourth periodic reports of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on its implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Introducing the reports, Han Tae Song, Permanent Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said that a number of legislative and administrative measures for the advancement of women in all fields of the State’s activities and social life had been taken, including the adoption of the law on the protection and promotion of the rights of women, the law on the protection of the rights of the child, and the law on labour protection.  An orderly work system to protect and promote women’s rights to address the slightest tendency of discriminating against women had been established.  Preferential treatment measures taken by the State were thoroughly implemented such as maternity leave, the exemption of women from arduous and harmful work, or the prohibition of women working night shifts and overtime.  Efforts to implement the Convention in good faith were now confronted with tremendous challenges in the form of vicious economic sanctions which ran counter to the ideals of humanitarianism and human rights and should be lifted immediately.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea categorically rejected the extremely politicized human rights dialogue based on false testimonies of the so-called defectors, but was willing to engage in dialogue and cooperation for the promotion and protection of genuine human rights, including women’s rights.

In the dialogue that followed, Committee Experts commended the adoption of the 2010 law on the protection and promotion of the rights of women, and asked about the system in place to ensure the upward feedback of the people at the grassroots level on the State’s policies and also about a mechanism to evaluate those policies to ensure that they did not violate human rights in general and women’s rights under the Convention in particular.  An issue of great concern was the widespread violence against women, especially reports of torture, sexual abuse and forced abortions that women repatriated from China suffered.  Further, there were cases of women being detained in political prison camps because of activities by their spouses or family members, and many detained women did not have access to a lawyer or a judge.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was a source country for women and girls who were subjected to forced labour, forced marriage and sex trafficking, and many were sold to Chinese men in search of wives, Experts noted and asked when would human trafficking be criminalized and when would repatriated women be provided with remedies and support services rather than with punishment.  The delegation was asked about measures to address the widespread hunger and malnutrition and ensure equal access to food for all, measures to increase the political and public participation of women, especially in the Foreign Service and the judiciary, and the situation of vulnerable groups of women, particularly women in detention and women with disabilities.

In concluding remarks, Ri Kyong Hun, Director of the Legislation Department, Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said that the dialogue was a learning process for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which would continue to take steps to expedite the implementation of the Convention throughout the country.

Dalia Leinarte, Committee Chairperson, commended the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for its efforts and encouraged it to address various recommendations which the Committee would issue with the purpose of the more comprehensive implementation of the Convention throughout the State party.

The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea included representatives of the Presidium of Supreme People’s Assembly, Central Court, Commission of Education, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Mission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office at Geneva.

The Committee will reconvene in public on Thursday, 9 November, at 10 a.m., to consider the combined initial to third periodic reports of Monaco CEDAW/C/MCO/1-3.

Report

The Committee is considering the combined second to fourth periodic reports of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea CEDAW/C/PRK/2-4.

Presentation of the Report

HAN TAE SONG, Permanent Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said that the consideration of its reports by the Committee today would provide the international community with an understanding of the real situation of women in the country.  The Government had taken a number of legislative and administrative measures for the advancement of women in all fields of State activities and social life, such as the adoption of the law on the protection and promotion of the rights of women, the law on the protection of the rights of the child, and the law on labour protection.  An orderly work system to protect and promote women’s rights and to address the slightest tendency of discriminating against women had been established.  Preferential treatment measures taken by the State were being thoroughly implemented such as maternity leave, the exemption of women from arduous and harmful work, or the prohibition of women working the night shift and overtime.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was a people-centred socialist State with its guiding principle of the Juche idea which was in essence, the idea of giving first priority to the popular masses.  The successes achieved in the field of women’s rights were the result of the correct policy of the Government which had given prominence to women as the subjects of history and true masters of socialist construction.  With the promulgation of the Decree on Gender Equality in 1946, women who had been suffering from the centuries-old shackles of feudalism and subjected to the fate of colonial slaves had proudly taken part in the State’s activities and social life with equal freedoms and rights with men for the first time.  A Mother’s Day on 16 November had been instituted several years ago, and was being observed meaningfully throughout the country. 

The efforts to implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in good faith and place the status of women in the highest standing were now being confronted with tremendous challenges.  The United States and other hostile forces impeded in every possible way the enjoyment of human rights by the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, including though manipulating the so-called sanctions resolutions against the country, which violated its right to existence and the right to development.  Vulnerable people such as women and children were the victims of those inhumane sanctions.  The vicious economic sanctions ran counter to the ideals of humanitarianism and human rights, could never be justified, and should be lifted immediately, stressed Ambassador Han.  During the period under review, there continued to be despicable plots to defame the image of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by kidnapping its women; an example was the luring and kidnapping of 12 women in April 2016 by South Korean intelligence services.

In closing, Ambassador Han said that a lot remained to be done in an effort to implement the Convention in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which required quality education and health, favourable working and living conditions for women, and cooperation with international organizations.  The Government categorically rejected the extremely politicized human rights dialogue based on false testimonies of the so-called defectors, but was willing to engage in dialogue and cooperation for the protection and promotion of genuine human rights, including women’s rights.

Questions from the Experts
  
Opening the interactive dialogue with the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, an Expert referred to the 2010 law on the protection and promotion of the rights of women, and asked how it incorporated the definition of discrimination as provided in article 1 of the Convention and the concept of gender equality as described in article 2.  What was the role and the contribution of women in the country to this law?

How did the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ensure the upward feedback and the input of the people at the grassroots level into policies?

What mechanism was in place to evaluate the State’s policies to ensure that they did not violate the human rights situation of the population and particularly women’s rights under the Convention?

Could the delegation explain which women’s organizations were receiving the State’s support, and whether they were civil society organizations or other kinds of institutions?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation said that the 2010 law on the protection and promotion of the rights of women provided in article 2 the commitment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to gender equality and the obligation of the State to prevent and not tolerate any form of discrimination against women.  All forms of discrimination were contained in article 2 of the law; although the law did not specifically define discrimination against women, in its article 2 it contained all the elements of the definition of discrimination against women as prescribed by the Convention.

During the preparation of the law, there was an intense debate in the country on how to define discrimination against women, which had not been done as yet.  However, during the preparation of the report to the Committee, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had committed to adopting such a definition in the future.

The law comprehensively provided for the rights of women, and in its article 3 defined an obligation of institutions and organizations to provide human rights in their respective units.  All women had equal economic, social and cultural rights throughout the country, which could not be violated by anyone.  Women had equal rights as men to vote and stand for elections.  Thus, the law contained articles and provisions providing for the equal rights of women in all fields – culture, education, health care, and others. 

In terms of the contribution of women to the 2010 law, a delegate said that the drafters of the law consulted with the institutions and organizations where women were dominant and with the people’s committees, thus ensuring that the law had incorporated the views of women from all walks of life in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

As for the contribution and input from women at the grassroots level, the delegation explained that there was an effective mechanism in place for the implementation and monitoring of the law, including in institutions which had in-house monitoring units which conducted regular surveys into the implementation of the law.  Particular attention was being given to monitoring and feedback on working conditions.  Any violations of women’s rights were referred to the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly. 

There were a number of civil society organizations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The Korean Federation for the Protection and Promotion of Persons with Disabilities carried out the State’s policy for the protection of persons with disabilities; it provided them with favourable working and living conditions, and conducted awareness raising activities on the rights of persons with disabilities.  The Korean Federation for Elderly Persons implemented the State’s policies and the law on elderly persons.  The Government was actively supporting the activities of civil society organizations in place which worked with persons with disabilities, the elderly and women.

An effective legal dissemination system was in place, from the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly to the grassroots level, through which laws and amendments to laws were disseminated, implemented and monitored.  This was also the way in which the 2010 law on the protection and promotion of the rights of women was being disseminated, and through which the awareness of women about this law was being raised.  The Presidium formulated a yearly action plan for the dissemination of laws, which was then forwarded to the legal committee; the Presidium also collected data on the implementation of the law, to enable monitoring.

Questions from the Experts
  
In the next round of questions, an Expert commended the efforts to strengthen the mechanism to advance equality between women and men and non-discrimination on the basis of sex, including the adoption of the 2010 law on the protection and promotion of the rights of women; the amendment to the law on socialist labour which had extended the duration of maternity leave in 2015; and the establishment of the National Committee in 2015 which was entrusted with the implementation of international human rights treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 2010 law.

Who were the members of the National Committee, what was the percentage of female members, and did women hold decision-making positions?  How did it ensure that the Convention was integrated in the State’s policy?

What was the mandate of the Korean Democratic Women’s Union and how did it interface with the National Committee? 

What was the status of the 10-year-old national action plan on women, which included gender equality?

Turning to access to justice, the Expert took positive note that the Convention had the same status as national legislation and asked about the cases in which women had used the Convention to claim their rights.  What complaint mechanism was in place for women whose rights had been violated under the 2010 law, what were the outcomes of those complaints, and had there been any prosecutions?

Another Expert congratulated the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the progress made in the participation of women in many areas, and asked about temporary special measures taken, or planned, to ensure the equal participation of women in high-level positions, particularly in the public sector where they represented only 14 per cent of directorship.  Women made up about 20 per cent of representative bodies at various levels, which was rather low – what was being done to redress this?

Responses by the Delegation

Responding to the questions raised about the National Committee, the delegation said that it was composed of representatives of a number of ministries, including on foreign affairs, public health, education, and labour, as well as of representatives of law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of People’s Security, the Central Court and the Central Prosecutor Offices.  The National Committee also included representatives of social organizations such as the Korean Federation for the Protection of Persons with Disabilities and the Korean Women’s Union.  It had 108 members of which 27 per cent were women.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was aware that the participation of women in this Committee was insufficient and was committed to increasing it.

Another delegate explained that the Korean Democratic Women’s Union was a social and mass organization which worked on promoting and advancing the rights of women.  Its Central Committee consisted of full-time workers, as well as representatives of a number of ministries, mass media and the institutions and enterprises in which women were a majority.  Its aim was to disseminate the State’s laws and policies among women, organize cultural and sports activities, and enhance the role of women in social activities and in the upbringing and development of children.  It made recommendations to the legislative and other organizations to improve women’s status in the country.

Questions from the Experts
  
A Committee Expert welcomed the measures taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to eradicate gender stereotypes and negative traditional views of the role and abilities of women in many areas of life, but it was a matter of concern that the adage “men are the sky and women are the ground” still continued to dominate in the society.  Women were banned from some professions, and the society continued to promote their primary role in the home and family life.

Other Experts noted that, according to several sources, violence against women in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was widespread, particularly domestic violence and sexual violence. 

According to the 2014 report of the Commission of Inquiry, rape, forced abortion and other sexual violence and abuses were widespread, while there were cases of women being detained in political prison camps because of activities by their spouses or family members.  Of particular concern was the torture and abuse in detention of women and their children forcibly deported from China to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

What other concrete measures, if any, were being undertaken by the authorities to address systemic discrimination, exploitation and abuses of women and young girls in the country?

The crime of human smuggling as set out in the legislation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not include trafficking, and did not meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons as set out in the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons.  Although the country had ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime in 2016, there were no significant efforts to address human trafficking through the enactment of legislation, prosecution, protection, or prevention measures.

When would the Democratic People's Republic of Korea accede to the 2000 United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol and establish a national policy on human trafficking?

Alternative sources indicated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was a source country for women and girls who were subjected to forced labour, forced marriage and sex trafficking.  Women from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea frequently fell victim to human traffickers who sold them to Chinese men in search of wives – it was estimated that 10,000 women and girls had migrated to China.  Such women who fell pregnant gave birth to children who were neither Chinese nor North Korean citizens, while those pregnant women caught by the Chinese police were repatriated to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and forced to abort their children by the North Korean officials.  Chinese authorities regarded the women as economic migrants rather than political asylum-seekers, and they often sent them back to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea where they could face punishment as political traitors, including forced labour in labour camps, harsh punishment or death.

When would the State party criminalize human trafficking and recognize it as a distinct crime from human smuggling?  Was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ready to provide remedies and support services to repatriated women rather than punitive measures?  How many women were repatriated from China to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea every year, what sentences were being imposed on those women, and how many women were subjected to forced abortions?

Responses by the Delegation

In his general statement on the questions raised by the Committee Experts, HAN TAE SONG, Permanent Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office at Geneva, regretted the unsubstituted allegations against the country as stated in the so-called anti-Democratic People's Republic of Korea human rights resolutions.  The delegation categorically rejected the Experts’ allegations of torture, rape, abuse and forced abortion, which were unfounded and politically motivated, and which were part of resolutions adopted every year against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by the Human Rights Council and the United Nations General Assembly.  Torture, rape, abuse and forced abortion did not exist in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea where they were prohibited by law and thus were not practiced.  The figure of 10,000 persons from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea being in China was totally groundless.

Another delegate reiterated that for years, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had been rejecting the groundless accusations and politicized resolutions by the international community.  Sanctions and economic containment by the United States since the 1990s, combined with natural disasters such as drought, had caused economic hardships in the country, particularly in the north, where many people had relatives in China.  Those people had gone to China to seek help from their relatives, but later returned.   

Human trafficking and smuggling was a very sensitive issue, particularly in the current tense context in the Korean Peninsula.  Everything was politicized now, even humanitarian issues.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea continued to regard the latest United Nations Security Council sanctions and the United States’ sanctions as inhumane and politicized.

There was no domestic violence in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

A Committee Expert stressed that the Committee did not invent the allegations of torture, rape and forced abortion; those were not a creation of the imagination of the Committee Experts but were based on the 2014 report of the International Commission of Inquiry.  Those questions were being raised because the Committee was there to assist the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its efforts to implementation the Convention, it was not there to play games.

Questions from the Experts
  
The delegation was asked about measures taken to increase the participation of women in political and public life, and particularly in the foreign service where women represented only 4.9 per cent, and in the judiciary.

There was no genuine civil society forum for the definition of human rights which was an important element in the protection and promotion of women’s rights – what was being done to promote and support the civil society element in the quest for the promotion of women’s rights?

On matters of citizenship and nationality, an Expert asked about measures being taken to assist children of citizens from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who did not have the citizenship.  Was gender-disaggregated data on stateless persons available?

Responses by the Delegation

As for women in the foreign service of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, increasing numbers were joining and many were going abroad to learn languages of a number of countries.  Women worked as staff in a number of United Nations agencies, and this was an area where gender equality was achieved.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was aware of the need to have more women and was hoping that additional numbers of women would join the Foreign Ministry, although the severing of diplomatic ties by a number of countries under pressure from the United States represented a challenge in this regard.

At the signing of the Convention in 2011, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had entered a reservation on article 9(b) concerning nationality of children born to Korean mothers and foreign fathers, but this reservation had been withdrawn as it was discriminatory to women.

As for children born to Korean women and Chinese men in China, according to the law they had the right to a Chinese nationality.  Should this fail, such persons could apply for citizenship of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 

At present, there were five or six stateless persons in the country, and those were born to a foreigner and a Korean woman.  They had already submitted application for citizenship, in the country or elsewhere, and while waiting for the nationality, they were given a certificate of statelessness by the Ministry for People’s Security.

Questions from the Experts

In the next round of questions, Committee Experts stressed that taking care of children was also the responsibility of men and asked whether there was a possibility of paid or unpaid paternity leave.  What measures were in place to enable men to take part in the raising and upbringing of their children?

The principle of equal pay for work of equal value was enshrined in the 2010 law on the protection and promotion of women’s rights – did this mean that it provided better protection to women in terms of equal pay than the labour law?

Women’s retirement age was 55 and it was 60 for men, which had a negative impact on their income and in their career development to enable them to reach senior positions.  Could women continue to work after the age of 55 and would the age of retirement be equalized for women and men?

Women accounted for 16 per cent of managers, 11 per cent of judges and 16 per cent of officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; at the same time, they represented 99 per cent of employees in kindergartens and over 80 per cent of primary school teachers.  What was being done, including by adopting temporary special measures, to promote the participation of women in managerial and leadership positions?

Were statistics about sexual harassment in the workplace available?  Was it prohibited by law and was there a complaint mechanism in place?

In its resolution from March 2017, the Human Rights Council had recognized the “widespread hunger and malnutrition in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea” and urged it to promote equal access to food.  Were there statistics available on those issues and what was being done to urge equal access for all?

What were the intentions concerning the expansion of women and maternal health services from Pyongyang to other areas of the country, particularly rural and remote regions? 

Abortion was legal, and over 70 per cent of women used contraceptives.  Were there any educational programmes targeting men to raise awareness that they were also responsible for contraception?

Replies by the Delegation

Responding to the questions and comments made by the Committee Experts, the delegation said that women were being encouraged to explore the possibility of studying in science and technology, and special measures were in place to promote their entry in those fields of studies.  Three years ago, an additional year had been added to college and its curriculum and teaching plan had been revised, which increased the chance for women to receive higher education.  In 2009, open and distance learning and education systems had been introduced, and many women were making use of them.

In terms of sexual education, students in secondary schools were taught about their bodies, and parents were also good teachers of children, particularly on development and sexual issues.  Household teachers visited houses and informed and counselled children on matters related to sexual education.

Previously, maternity leave had been two months before and three months after the birth.  In 2015, maternity leave had been extended to 240 days.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea had not yet introduced paternity leave.

Retirement age was 55 for women and 60 for men; this was one of the temporary special measures to introduce gender equality in the country, and had been taken in consideration of physiological conditions and customary practices.  The retirement age was a minimum age and a woman wishing to work beyond that age was allowed to do so. 

In terms of temporary special measures to promote the participation of women in high-ranking positions, the delegation said that all women could accede to those positions after passing the exams, and a series of measures were available to support women in this endeavour, for example through in-service training, and media attention given to highly successful women who were awarded with labour hero medals and awards.

The Criminal Law provided criminal sanctions for a person raping another through the use of violence and threats, and also sanctions for forcing a subordinate woman to have sexual intercourse with her supervisor.  No incidents of sexual harassment had been reported. 

As for the widespread hunger and malnutrition, a delegate noted a marked improvement in this area and said that a nutritional survey was being planned for next year which would provide adequate statistics.  A 2015 nutritional survey had shown that 20 to 32 per cent of women had been malnourished, while a multiple indicators survey of 2009 had shown 32 per cent malnutrition and 5.2 per cent acute malnutrition rate among women of reproductive age.

The implementation of a reproductive health strategy had started in 2006, which paid special attention to preventing illegal abortion and abortion complications.  The household doctor system of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, highly commended by the World Health Organization, provided special care in respect of reproductive and sexual health, education and information.

The delegation reassured the Committee that the principle of equal pay for work of equal value applied, for example, in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a director of the Asian department and a director of the European department were paid the same, regardless of the gender of the post holder.

Further on sexual harassment in the workplace, the delegation said that regardless of the age of the superior, whenever he forced a woman he supervised to have sexual intercourse under threat of losing a job, or a promise of a better job, the woman had a choice not to comply with the request.  If the supervisor continued to use power and sexual intercourse took place, such an act would be sanctioned as a rape. 

Such cases could not be settled by a complaint.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea had a very well developed public reporting system and a woman suffering harassment at work could file a complaint to the Ministry of People’s Security.  Every home, office and public place contained a list of telephone numbers for emergency, accident and assistance, which could be used by all and any victims of sexual violence. 

In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sexual violence, sexual harassment, domestic violence or marital rape were very strange words, people were struggling to understand what they meant simply because those phenomena did not happen frequently and were not issues of social importance.

Questions from the Experts
  
A Committee Expert inquired about the extent to which gender was mainstreamed in the country’s poverty reduction and development policies.  Were there any instances of discrimination against women in accessing social benefits and pensions?

As for rural women, the delegation was asked whether they had equal opportunities as women from urban areas, and the proportion of women born and raised in rural areas and on farms that went on to university.

Which women’s groups and associations freely advocated for women’s rights and how were independent women’s groups consulted in the elaboration of policies?  How many women and girls had disabilities, what was their access to education and health services, and what employment opportunities did they have? 

The delegation was also asked about the situation of women in detention, and about repatriated women, including from China.  It had been reported that repatriated women were often subjected to detention, harsh treatment and even forced abortion, while those sentenced to labour often were denied access to a lawyer or a judge.  How many women had died in detention, what were the causes of death, and how many women in detention underwent abortion every year?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation said that regulations on social insurance and social security were in place and they guaranteed women equal rights as men.  In addition, a variety of family benefits were provided without any discrimination, such as maternity leave benefits, disability benefits, benefits for families of soldiers, and benefits for child-headed households, for elderly households, and others.

As for the situation of women from rural and farming communities, in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, everyone benefitted from compulsory and free education up to the secondary level, and everyone was free to go to a tertiary institution of their choice.  The proportion of women in urban areas receiving tertiary education was higher than in farming communities.

The delegation said that following the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had adopted a law on the protection of persons with disabilities, which focused on maintaining the dignity of persons with disabilities and preventing their marginalization.  It was also important to detect and prevent factors that might give rise to disability.  According to the 2014 sample survey, six per cent of the population over the age of 60 had a disability.

Questions from the Experts
  
A Committee Expert noted that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had recognized in its replies to the list of issues to the Committee that domestic violence existed, that there were educational materials available to prevent the phenomenon, and that domestic violence was a crime and thus not a family matter. 

The delegation was asked to provide further information about those educational materials and speak of their dissemination and target groups.  What were the statistics on domestic violence and complaints?  What protection mechanisms for victims were in place, including shelters?

What was the definition of rape and was marital rape recognized in the legislation?  If a woman who suffered marital rape wanted a divorce, how did she proceed?

What were the grounds for divorce?  Could the delegation explain the legal provision under which those responsible for the destruction of family life could be sent to a labour camp?

Responses by the Delegation

In response to the issues raised by the Experts, the delegation said that there were many kinds of television serials and feature films which addressed the subject of domestic violence and that in educating people, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resorted to influence through good examples and good practices.

The family was the basic unit of society and a harmonious society without a harmonious family was unthinkable.  Workshops and training sessions were regularly conducted for law enforcement officers.

A delegate invited Committee Experts to explain what marital rape was and provide a definition.  The procedure on divorce following a rape was not clear.  One of the grounds for divorce was if a couple was childless and one of the partners refused to adopt.  Adultery was not subject to criminal sanctions; it was sanctioned if it took place for the purpose of breaking up a family.

A complaint of marital rape could be filed by the woman to the Family Court.  About 2,000 cases for divorce had been brought in 2016, and 1,700 up to October 2017; less woman filed for divorce than men.

In adoption, the consent of a child over six years of age was needed.

Concluding Remarks

RI KYONG HUN, Director of the Legislation Department, Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, thanked the Committee Experts and said that the dialogue was a learning process for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which would continue to take steps to expedite the implementation of the Convention throughout the country.

DALIA LEINARTE, Committee Chairperson, commended the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for its efforts and encouraged it to address various recommendations which the Committee would issue with the purpose of the more comprehensive implementation of the Convention throughout the State party.

2349059,"Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women considers the report of Kenya Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women

2 November 2017

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women today considered the eighth periodic report of Kenya on its implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Introducing the report, Sicily Kariuki, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs of Kenya, said that although faced with various challenges, Kenya’s endeavour to realize the right to equal opportunities in political, social, economic and cultural spheres for women, men, boys and girls remained on course.  Kenya continued to put in place measures to eradicate all forms of discrimination against women, including through the establishment of the National Gender and Equality Commission Act, the prohibition of female genital mutilation in 2011, and the adoption in 2015 of the Protection from Domestic Violence Act.  In the last elections held in August 2017, three women had been elected as Governors, 23 as members of parliament and five as Senators.  Another historic achievement was the establishment of a fully-fledged and well-resourced Department of Gender Affairs, which strengthened the national gender machinery.  Earlier this year, a four-year initiative had been launched in cooperation with United Nations agencies to accelerate efforts to prevent gender-based violence, strengthen the protection of survivors of gender-based violence, and ensure the expeditious prosecution of perpetrators. 

During the discussion, Committee Experts deplored the shrinking space for civil society due to stark limitations on foreign funding and various administrative limitations imposed on civil society organizations, and expressed concern about threats to life, security and concrete work of women human rights defenders.  Experts also inquired about the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention, unequal treatment of women in Islamic marriages in terms of their marriage and family rights, temporary special measures, negative stereotypes and traditions, female genital mutilation and the practice of “beading”, trafficking in persons, and sexual exploitation of children.  Other issues of concern included the political representation of women, birth registration, statelessness and nationality, education for women and girls, discrepancy in university education among girls and boys, sexual harassment at the workplace, maternity leave, restrictive abortion laws, access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, the maternal mortality rate, the protection of domestic workers, credit distribution to women, the situation of rural women and indigenous women, and matrimonial property and inheritance.

In concluding remarks, Mwanamaka Amani Mabruki, Principal Secretary of the State Department of Gender Affairs of Kenya, reiterated the commitment of the Government of Kenya to uphold the country’s international obligations.  The Government would not lose sight of the fact that gender equality and women’s empowerment lay in continued and constructive dialogue with the Committee.   

Dalia Leinarte, Committee Chairperson, thanked the delegation for their responses and explanations, which had provided further insight into the situation of women and girls in Kenya.  She encouraged the delegation to address the various concerns voiced by Committee Experts for the benefit of all women and girls in the country.

The delegation of Kenya participated in the dialogue via video conference, and it included representatives of the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, the State Department of Gender Affairs, the Council of Governors, the University of Nairobi, the Kenyatta National Hospital, the Women Enterprise Fund, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the State Department for Social Protection, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. 

The delegation of Kenya also included representatives of the Permanent Mission of Kenya to the United Nations Office at Geneva, who were present in the room during the dialogue.

The Committee will reconvene in public on Friday, 3 November at 10 a.m. to consider the combined second and third periodic reports of Oman (CEDAW/C/OMN/2-3).

Report

The Committee is considering the eighth periodic report of Kenya (CEDAW/C/KEN/8) via videoconference.

Presentation of the Report

SICILY KARIUKI, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs of Kenya, reiterated the full commitment of Kenya to the implementation of the Convention that it had ratified in 1984, and to the continued acceleration of gender equality and the promotion and protection of the rights of women and girls at all levels.  Kenya’s gender mainstreaming programmes were intended to ensure that gender issues were incorporated into the national development planning process, and that Constitutional values and principles of equality, equity, respect for human dignity, inclusiveness and non-discrimination, continued to inspire legislation, policies and programmes to meet the goal of equity.

Although faced with various challenges, Kenya’s endeavour to realize the right to equal opportunities in political, social, economic and cultural spheres for women, men, boys and girls remained on course.  The country continued to put in place measures to eradicate all forms of discrimination against women, and had initiated several affirmative measures to redress any disadvantages suffered by women due to past discrimination.  Over the last six years, Kenya had enacted a number of laws for gender equality and inclusion, such as the National Gender and Equality Commission Act of 2011, the Matrimonial Property Act of 2013, the Protection from Domestic Violence Act of 2015, the Land Act of 2012, and the Counter-Trafficking Act N°8 of 2010.  Kenya had also prohibited female genital mutilation in 2011, amended the sexual offences act in 2006, and adopted the national human rights act in 2012 to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all; the law of succession act was currently being reviewed to align this legislation with the Constitution of Kenya.  

Kenya had witnessed an unprecedented transformation in women’s political participation since the promulgation of the Constitution in 2010.  In the last elections held in August 2017, women for the first time had been elected as Governors - three out of 47 posts were held by women - women were elected to hold 23 out of 210 member of parliament seats, and five out of 47 Senators were women.  However, only 98 women had been elected for the 1,450 county level positions, which was not optimal.  Another historic achievement was the establishment of a fully-fledged and well-resourced Department of Gender Affairs, which strengthened the national gender machinery.  Critical measures had been taken to mainstream gender in national development: gender mainstreaming had been included in the performance assessment of all Government agencies to strengthen accountability for gender equality across the public service, and statistical officers, planning officers and gender officers at the national and county levels were being trained in gender statistics to enhance the collection, collation and analysis of sex disaggregated data.

Ms. Kariuki stressed the importance that Kenya accorded to the Sustainable Development Goals; Kenya had embarked on their institutionalization by directing all Government bodies and agencies to mainstream the Goals in policies, plans and budgets.  A baseline survey on gender-related Sustainable Development Goals had been implemented in order to verify the progress towards achieving the Goals, and to establish the extent to which the Goals converged with the national development objectives set out in the Kenya Vision 2030, a blueprint for development implemented through five-year plans.  Kenya continued to strengthen its Affirmative Action Funds to improve the economic empowerment of women, including the Women Enterprise Fund, the UWEZO (Ability Fund), the Youth Development Fund, and the Access to Government Procurement Opportunities.  Earlier this year, a four-year initiative had been launched in cooperation with United Nations agencies to accelerate efforts to prevent gender-based violence, strengthen protection of survivors of gender-based violence, and ensure the expeditious prosecution of perpetrators.  Kenya was developing a national policy on the elimination of child labour; it had launched the African Union Campaign on ending child marriage and was developing a strategy for the elimination of this practice.

Questions from the Experts
  
In the first round of questions, a Committee Expert addressed the issue of the institutional and legal framework in Kenya, and, referring to the work of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission to examine violations of human rights in Kenya from 1963 to 28 February 2008, asked whether a legislative and administrative framework for the implementation of its recommendation had been established.  To what extent were the Commission’s recommendations regarding women’s rights being prioritized?  

The Committee deplored the shrinking space for civil society due to stark limitations for foreign funding and various administrative limitations imposed on civil society organizations, and expressed concern about threats to life, security and concrete work of women human rights defenders. 

Had Kenya rescinded the 15 per cent limit on foreign funding to non-governmental organizations, including those active in the promotion of the human rights of women?  Had the Kenya Information and Communication (Amendment) Act and the Media Council Act been reviewed to safeguard the principles of the Constitution?  What was the status of the implementation of the 2013 Public Benefits Organization Act?

Were all cases of attacks on women human rights defenders investigated and prosecuted, with sanctions applied to perpetrators, and reparations provided to the victims?

What was the state of affairs concerning the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention?

The Expert commended Kenya for its 2010 Convention which contained an extensive bill of rights, and, noting that sexual orientation and gender identity were not listed in the Constitution, asked about the extent of the anti-discrimination protection for lesbian, bisexual and transwomen.  Could the delegation update the Committee on the status of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation and explain how it would be reconciled with the continued criminalization of homosexuality in the penal code?

The Committee was concerned about the plural legal system in Kenya and the application of the Marriage Act in the field of personal status which represented a violation of the equality principle, as it deprived women in Islamic marriages of their right to equal treatment in the fundamental field of marriage and family.

Was Kenya ready to proceed with an analysis of the laws on personal status and other laws to address possible discrimination against women?  What was the possibility of appealing the Khadi court decisions to the civil courts, and what were the outcomes and concrete data on this?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation said that the Optional Protocol was still awaiting ratification by Parliament, following the enactment of the Treaty Making and Ratification Act in 2012.

Kenya had not adopted comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation yet, which was currently with the Kenya Law Commission.  It was hoped that this legislation would be in place soon.  Homosexuality still remained a criminal offence, but the comprehensive legislation would be subjected to a public debate, and it was hoped that homosexuality would find a place in the new anti-discrimination law.

On the application of Islamic law, Kenya had a very unique history with Islam and the Khadi courts, which had been demonstrated in the debates that had preceded the adoption of the 2010 Constitution.  It was a very emotive issue in the country.  The provisions in the Constitution that exempted the application of equality principles in the Constitution were closely connected with those unique challenges.  The implementation of the Islamic law was subject to the Constitution, and any action of the Islamic law which contravened the Constitution was deemed illegal.

All courts, including the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and the family courts applied the provisions of the Convention; the application of the Convention’s principles by courts was now a matter of judicial practice, including in matters of inheritance, customary marriages, and the application of customary law.  The Supreme Court in its advisory decision of 2012 had defended the progressive realization in the two-third gender rule by invoking articles of the Convention.

A delegate reiterated the commitment of Kenya to its reporting obligations to human rights treaty bodies and for the implementation of the Convention in the country.  Gender equality was a process and no country in the world today had fully achieved it.  It was important to stress that Kenya had put in place more progressive gender equality measures than a number of developed countries.

The jurisdiction of the Khadi courts was confined to matters of the Muslim personal laws, including in marriage, divorce, inheritance and custody.  A case could be only brought to the Khadi court by persons of Muslim faith who had recognized and submitted to the jurisdiction of the Khadi court.  A judge in the Khadi court had to be a person of Muslim faith and knowledgeable in Muslim law.  At the moment, no woman served as a Khadi court judge.  On this issue, there was a need to engage public conversation and discussion.  There were cases in which the High Court had overturned the decisions of the Khadi court, when those had been found to be contrary to the Constitution.

Polygamy was a very entrenched practice in Islam and in customary traditions in Kenya; it was practiced by 60 per cent of the population which recognized this form of marriage.  Measures were being taken to protect women in polygamous marriages, including through the Marriage Act, which required all marriages to be registered.  Kenya acknowledged the challenges of polygamy, but this was a reality in the society.

Questions from the Experts
  
A Committee Expert commended the initiatives to strengthen the gender machinery in the country, in particular the setting up of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission, the National Gender and Equalities Commission and the Office of the Ombudsman, and the establishment of the Directorate of Gender in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning, and the Department of Gender Affairs.

The Committee was however concerned about the mandate and functioning of those institutions, and the resources allocated to each.  What inter-institutional cooperation mechanisms and capacity-building programmes were in place to ensure harmonized implementation between the three different rights institutions?  How were the mandate of the National Gender and Equalities Commission coordinated with the mandates of the National Human Rights Commission and the Office of the Ombudsman?

What were the achievements thus far of the Directorate of Gender?  Were the 100 gender officers recruited and deployed to various Government ministries?

The Performance Contract Monitoring Tool had been developed to capture the rate of implementation of gender mainstreaming objectives concerning employment and promotion, including the two-thirds gender representation in the public sector.  Was there an impact assessment of the Tool and its effectiveness in regularly delivering the information needed for effective decision-making?

Another Expert commended Kenya for measures taken to increase the participation of women, the Constitutional provision for the two-thirds gender principle, and the extension of this principle to lists of political parties. 

Was Kenya applying temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality in other fields, and if so, what was their impact?  Was there a possibility to adopt temporary special measures to increase the number of women in the Khadi courts?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation explained that the principle of gender equality was anchored in the national development plan and the Sustainable Development Goal 5 in the national gender plan.  The budgets for the State Department for Gender Affairs and the National Gender and Equalities Commission had seen a progressive increase over the past several years.  Both institutions promoted the constitutional provision of gender equality; the Commission played an oversight role in promoting gender equality and freedom from discrimination, while the State Department implemented tangible programmes and initiatives for gender equality.

In terms of the major achievements by the State Department for Gender Affairs to date, the delegation said that gender mainstreaming into the budget was ongoing, and budget guidelines for 2016-17 had included the consideration of gender in setting the mid-term targets and pushing for Government accountability for gender budgeting.  A system had been initiated for the centralized collection of sex disaggregated data as well as data on disability. 

The State Department for Gender Affairs ensured that gender mainstreaming was being undertaken in all ministries through gender focal points, to build the staff capacity and comply with the constitution principle of two-thirds gender representation.  Furthermore, the national strategy for the improvement of political representation of women had been launched and was being implemented, while funds were in place to support women’s economic empowerment.  The development of gender development policy had been initiated.

Kenya had three human rights bodies – the Kenya National Human Rights Commission, the National Gender and Equalities Commission, and the Office of the Ombudsman – and each had its mandate and functions set out in the Constitution and the founding documents.  There was no overlap between the three.  The National Gender and Equalities Commission was in charge of promoting gender, equality and non-discrimination, and had been at the forefront of identifying cases of discrimination and proposing remedial action to the Government.  The Commission on Administrative Justice, or the Ombudsman, was a body that anyone from the public could address if they felt that any public official was engaged in injustice, misbehaviour, inefficiency, or inaptitude.  The Kenya National Human Rights Commission had the mandate to promote human rights and develop the culture of respect for human rights in the country, and did not specifically address gender equality. 

As for the implementation of the two-thirds gender rule, the delegation explained that the Supreme Court advisory on the matter had been clear that this principle could not be realized immediately, and that the goal of at least 30 per cent of the members of parliament being women could only be implemented progressively.  Measures were still not in place to operationalize this progressive approach.  Kenya had taken steps to address electoral gender-based violence through awareness raising and civic education programmes focused on peace; as a result, there was less violence against women candidates during the August 2017 elections, and more women had been elected than ever before.

Questions from the Experts
  
Committee Experts took positive note of the action by Kenya to address negative stereotypes and traditions, including the revision of the education curriculum and engaging men in preventing violence against women.  Still, the persistence of adverse norms and traditions, patriarchal practices and harmful traditional practices such as gender-based violence and early marriage, was alarming.  Particularly worrying were extremely high rates of violence against women and gender-based violence, and the lack of investigations and prosecutions of cases.

The delegation was asked to provide data on prosecutions and sanctions for female genital mutilation, particularly in indigenous pastoralist communities; and sanctions and measures to eliminate the abominable practice of “beading” whereby girls as young as 7 were given to older males in the community in temporary marital relationships.

The delegation was also asked about the efforts to curb trafficking in persons and assist the victims, in particular children.  Were there any cases of prosecution of public officials for collusion with human traffickers?  What was the status of the implementation of the national referral mechanism?  What strategy for the prosecution and sanctioning of perpetrators of trafficking in persons was in place?

What was being done to protect children from sexual exploitation, including refugee children, and to reduce demand for prostitution?  How did Kenya envisage supporting women in prostitution to exit the profession?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation explained that the rate of female genital mutilation had significantly dropped over the past several years and now stood at 21 per cent.  Kenya had prohibited female genital mutilation in 2011 and over the past two years, 77 cases had been handled, in which 10 sentences had been handed down, seven had been acquitted and over 50 cases were ongoing.  The anti-female genital mutilation strategy had not yet been adopted, it was at the Cabinet level at the moment.

Measures to eliminate the practice of “beading” among the Samburu could be based on the legislation protecting children, but a specific law to deal with this harmful traditional practices was not yet in place.  Research had been conducted which highlighted the connection between female genital mutilation and beading, and organizations working on the ground to eliminate female genital mutilation were now enlarging their field of action to also include “beading”.  “Beading” involved sexual conduct against very young children and as such could be handled under the sexual offences act and defilement which carried a life prison sentence for those found guilty.

Awareness raising activities were focused on men, to increase the understanding that they had an important role to play in protecting their daughters or wives from harmful traditional practices, and to change the mind-set whereby only a woman who had undergone female genital mutilation was fit for marriage.  Activities were ongoing with religious communities, particularly Muslim communities, to raise awareness about female genital mutilation and the messages there were focused on the fact that female genital mutilation was not required under the Quran or Islamic faith.

As there was a trend of medicalization of female genital mutilation, efforts were also directed at the medical profession, to raise their awareness about the ethical aspects of the procedure, as well as the fact that it was harmful and illegal.

Kenya had conducted human trafficking research which had shown that 33 per cent of victims were children, 26 per cent were men, and the rest were women; people were mainly trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation.  The national assistance trust fund had been established, unfortunately it had no budget allocated last year, but this year, US$ 200,000 had been allocated.  The Government was in the process of setting up shelters for victims of trafficking in persons, one in Nairobi and one in Mombasa.  A hotline was in place to which all suspicions of information on human trafficking could be reported. 

The collusion of public officials with traffickers was sanctioned under the anti-corruption crimes act and the bribery act.  The delegation agreed that there was a very low awareness on the trafficking in persons act among the law enforcement officials, who mostly relied on the sexual offences act.  The trafficking in persons in act was included in training of the police to increase the awareness and the application of the law.

So far in 2017, no female genital mutilation cases had been filed.  In 2014/15, the conviction rate for the female genital mutilation cases stood at 74 per cent, and at 75 per cent the following fiscal year.  The Office of Public Prosecutor worked closely with the female genital mutilation board on the operationalization of the female genital mutilation act and had been actively involved in the community sensitisation and training duty bearers.  It also trained law enforcement and military officers in matters concerning sexual exploitation offences.

The prosecution data for the practice of “beading” were not available, the only data that could give insight into the prosecutorial action taken on this matter was data on defilement and child marriage cases.

As for women in prostitution being victimized by the police, the Government was sensitizing the police on how to deal with those women, and the national referral mechanism guidelines set out the operating procedures from the identification of the victim to connecting her to medical and other forms of assistance.  Women could file complaints of gender-based violence through a toll free help line, or could address gender desks in the police stations.

Questions from the Experts
  
In the next round of questions, an Expert stressed that passing a law on political representation of women in the parliament was Kenya’s international obligation and asked about financial and other forms of assistance and support being provided to women candidates so that they could have a better chance of being elected.

What was the situation concerning the participation of women in leadership positions in the public and private sector companies?  What had been done to identify and punish perpetrators of electoral violence against women?

The Marriage Act required customary marriages to be registered within three months, which enabled women to obtain the documents they needed to issue passports.  What was being done to sensitize women about this provision and ensure that the spouse did not put obstacles to marriage registration.

Rates of birth registration in rural and remote areas were low – what was being done to facilitate access to birth registration facilities, especially for women from disadvantaged groups.

The Committee commended the 2015 decree to grant identity cards and land deeds to the stateless Makonde community and asked about steps taken to address the situation of other stateless groups such as the Pemba and others.

An Expert praised Kenya for its generous policy towards refugees and asylum-seekers and asked about access to identity cards and nationality for refugee women married to Kenyans and the children born from such marriages.

Responses by the Delegation

In response to the questions raised on increasing the political participation of women, the delegation said that women were being encouraged to vote, including through measures to facilitate the voting by fast-tracking pregnant women or women with small children through the queues.  In addition, there were numerous civic education programmes for the population to increase the knowledge and awareness about the functioning of a parliamentary democracy and the important role that women played within. 

Kenya was grappling with the question of refugees and the issue of nationality in this context had not been addressed as yet.  The Government had taken steps to address the challenges faced by the stateless Nubian and Makonde populations, and had issued them with identity cards and title deeds and recognized them as a tribe of Kenya.  Committees in the Somali-populated counties had been set up to issue identity cards, and all children were issued with birth certificates to avoid the problem of statelessness. 

The Marriage Act had resolved a problem of access to passports for women in customary marriages, by requiring that all customary marriages be registered, and this enabled women to obtain a marriage certificate which was necessary to issue the passport.  Kenya was aware that the sensitisation of women in customary knowledge and raising their knowledge about the registration process as defined by the Marriage Act was important.

Digitization of birth certificates was an ongoing process.

In public institutions, there was a requirement that gender policies were adopted in line with the constitutional provisions and that those policies were applied in the recruitment and promotion of staff. 

The delegation said that the Government had to consult the Office of the Attorney General about the ratification of the 1994 Convention on Statelessness.  As for women’s representation in the civil service, the two thirds gender rule worked on a competitive basis, and aimed to reflect various ethnicities in the country.  In terms of ambassadorial appointments, out of 71 ambassadors, 20 were female.

The National Steering Committee was in charge of the implementation of the National Action Plan on Gender across the sectors.  The Committee was representative of various sectors, including civil society. 

Questions by Committee Experts

On education for women and girls, Experts commended an increase in the number of girls enrolled in secondary school, and in their completion rate.  However, the issue of children out of school remained problematic.  Girls dropped out of school due to pregnancy and early or forced marriages.  There was a much lower number of girls studying at universities than boys.  What special programmes were envisaged to be put in place to address the low school enrolment rate among girls?  What major actions had been taken to ensure education for girls with disabilities and for girls who were victims of female genital mutilation, rape and gender-based violence?  How much of the budget had been spent for education of women and girls?  As for violence in schools, how many teachers had been prosecuted under the Children’s Act of 2001?

Turning to sexual harassment at the workplace, there were no sanctions when employers were diplomats or in a position of authority.  Many families placed their daughters in families to perform domestic work.  Many of them were subject to sexual abuse.  Did the State party plan to draft a law in line with the International Labour Organization Convention 189?             

Experts welcomed the introduction of the three-month paid maternity leave.  Did the Labour Law include provisions prohibiting direct and indirect gender-based discrimination in line with the International Labour Organization Convention 111 of 1958? 

Women continued to provide community and home-based care.  But those contributions continued to be unrecognized in the calculation of the gross domestic product.  Women produced the majority of food in Kenya and worked longer hours in the agricultural sector without additional remuneration.  Did the State party plan to draw a study on the conditions of female agricultural workers?

As for access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, a number of problems remained.  What measures had been taken to improve access to maternal healthcare free of charge?  Did those services cover prenatal and post-natal periods?  What was the scope of free healthcare and its impact on maternal health rates?  The maternal mortality rate seemed to stem from the lack of access to safe abortion.  What steps had been made to assess the impact of unsafe abortion on maternal mortality?  Would the State party consider decriminalizing abortion?  Was it possible to legalize abortion in case of rape?

In 2015 the country had not met the Millennium Development Goal on HIV/AIDS.  What preventive steps had been made to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS?  Was comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education provided to women with disabilities? 

Replies by the Delegation

Answering questions about education, the delegation explained that the Government had taken steps to provide free primary and secondary education, and provide food and sanitary towels in schools in order to ensure that disadvantaged girls were able to access education.  There were approximately one million out of school children due to cultural and religious practices.  The Government had involved parents to ensure that all children were enrolled in school.  Pregnant girls were allowed to go back home and to return to school after birth, and they were provided with counselling services.  The Government had also put in place measures to enable girls with disabilities to have access to education.  Learners with special needs received financial aid.  As for university education, the Government applied affirmative action so that girls received loans and scholarships.     

As for abuse of pupils by teachers, all disciplinary channels were implemented under the Children’s Act of 2001 and teachers who were sanctioned under that law could no longer teach in Kenya.  The names of culprits were published in the Kenya Gazette.  In addition, teachers were trained on how to help affected children overcome the trauma of sexual harassment. 

On sexual harassment at the workplace, the Sexual Offences Act was under review as it had been suggested that it be expanded to hold persons in positions of authority and those in the private sector accountable.

The Government was taking steps to protect domestic workers through measures, such as registration of domestic workers for national health insurance and pension benefits.  There were also initiatives to address their working hours.   

With respect to the possibility for employers in the private sector to use the maternity leave to deny women access to employment, this was prohibited under the law and women had legal recourse.  The Government ensured that employers followed practices aligned with constitutional provisions.  The law was also clear about the need to protect casual labourers’ right to maternity leave. 

The Government had launched a free of charge maternity health programme in 2013.  There were sometimes problems of limited financial and human resources.  Abortion was illegal unless the mother’s life was in danger.  There was HIV/AIDS education at the school level and also sexual and reproductive health education to reduce the risk of adolescents seeking illegal abortion.  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adolescents was high, which was why the President had launched an initiative to introduce youth-friendly services at clinics.  Prostitutes had their own clinics where they could access health services. 

Follow-up Questions by Experts

Would the State party align its regulations on female domestic workers with the International Labour Organization resolution 111?

Experts stressed the need to provide free of charge prenatal and post-natal healthcare for the poorest women.  If sexual and reproductive health education did not go hand in hand with services, it would not be effective. 

Were there any incentives for parents to send their daughters to school?  What was the illiteracy rate among adult women and what actions had been taken to address that issue?

Experts noted that the State party needed to widen the scope of its restrictive abortion laws, which led to clandestine abortions.  There was a need to streamline the provision of safe abortion across the country, not just in the capital. 

With respect to the very wide discrepancy in university education among girls and boys, what steps had been taken to close that gap?  What was being done to address the problem of chemicals used in flower farms and their impact on women’s fertility?

Replies by the Delegation

The delegation clarified that Kenya was still in the process of addressing the challenges faced by domestic workers.  As for the impact of chemicals used in flower farms on women’s fertility, there had been a shift and more and more farms issued protective clothing to women.

Abortion was allowed under some circumstances, but it was not permitted unless approved by a trained medical professional.  The law clearly stipulated cases in which abortion was allowed. 

The literacy rate in Kenya stood at 74 per cent for women.  The Government had established five institutions to educate adult learners. 

Questions by Committee Experts

Experts inquired about the steps taken by the Government to ensure credit distribution to women.  They commended the provision of funds and loans for start-up companies and women enterprise funds, but raised concern about the lack of awareness of women about those funds and loans.  What was the profile of borrowers and was entrepreneurial capacity building available to women?  Did the State party plan to place women in fund management positions? 

Turning to rural women, Experts asked about the status of the gender policy for agricultural development, given that women made up between 60 to 80 per cent of the labour in agricultural production.  What were the measures taken to guarantee women’s participation in decision-making in regard to rural development?  What was the mechanism and what measures were in place to grant women greater access to land, credit, and banking services?  What was the impact of the Table Banking Scheme launched by the Government to allow women to save and access loans?             

As for the indigenous people of the Endorois community, what was the status of the task force on the implementation of the ruling of the African Court of Human and Peoples Rights that recognized their rights over their ancestral lands in the Kenya Rift Valley? 

On women with disabilities, there were four broad areas of concern: protection of their sexual and reproductive health rights, legal capacity to own property, violence against them, and access to justice.   There were reports of violence against older women who had been accused of witchcraft.

With respect to reports of violence against women and girls in the Baringo county by cattle raiders, was there a criminal offence of rustling and how did the State party address its obligations to provide security and safety?  

Replies by the Delegation

On women’s access to public procurement opportunities, the delegation stated that 30 per cent of tenders had been reserved for women.   The Women Enterprise Fund ensured that affordable and accessible loans were available to women, including capacity-building programmes.  Those loans were interest free.   

As for rural women, the Law on Succession Act was currently under review to address the issue of discrimination of women in land and property.  Women had opportunities to participate in decision making on agricultural development through grass-root school boards, which had to comply with provisions on public participation and non-discrimination. 

The Government was planning to map out incidences of violence against women with disabilities in rural areas, completion rates in school and the prevalence of pregnancies.  On the Endorois community, in line with the Constitution, land should be managed in an equitable manner and in a way that did not discriminate on the basis of gender.      

Questions by Committee Experts

Experts noted that the Matrimonial Property Act of 2014 still contained some discriminatory elements, adding that many lower courts still required the proof of contribution.  Would the State party consider repealing that section of the Matrimonial Property Act?  How did the requirement for the consent of the other spouse on any transaction of matrimonial property work in polygamy?  There was also a problem with the Law of Succession Act which rendered void a widow’s inheritance rights if she remarried.  Would that be reconsidered?  Would the State party consider introducing post-divorce support for the spouse who left the marriage in a weaker economic position?

Replies by the Delegation      

Under the Matrimonial Property Act, women were supposed to prove their contribution, which was considered as a setback.  Nevertheless, the improvement was that the act took cognizance of monetary and non-monetary contributions of spouses.  The proof of contribution could be challenged in court.  The Law of Succession Act was under review and the Government hoped that it would address the issue of areas of inheritance still governed by customary law.  There had been progressive jurisprudence in courts which ensured that women gained equal inheritance.  

Follow-up Questions by Experts

Would the State party operationalise a climate change bill and take legal and administrative measures to address gender-related climate change impacts?

Replies by the Delegation

The Climate Change Act of 2016 had stipulated a national mandate to establish gender-oriented climate change programmes and plans, and had made provisions for the establishment of a climate change fund. 

Concluding Remarks

MWANAMAKA AMANI MABRUKI, Principal Secretary of the State Department of Gender Affairs of Kenya, reiterated the commitment of the Government of Kenya to uphold the country’s international obligations.  The Government would not lose sight of the fact that gender equality and women’s empowerment lay in continued and constructive dialogue with the Committee.   

DALIA LEINARTE, Committee Chairperson, thanked the delegation for their responses and explanations, which had provided further insight into the situation of women and girls in Kenya.  She encouraged the delegation to address the various concerns voiced by Committee Experts for the benefit of all women and girls in the country.

2349049,"Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women reviews the report of Burkina Faso Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women

24 October 2017

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women today considered the seventh periodic report of Burkina Faso on its implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Introducing the report, Laure Zongo Hien, Minister for Women, National Solidarity and Family, said that Burkina Faso continued to take steps to strengthen the legislative and institutional framework for the rights of women: it had adopted a number of legal texts, including on the prevention, repression and reparations for violence against women and girls, and on the protection of children in conflict with the law. The national strategy for the promotion and protection of girls 2017-2026 and the national strategic plan for the elimination of female genital mutilation were in place, and the country was taking tangible and concrete steps to protect women from domestic violence, early and forced marriage, sexual harassment, and female genital mutilation. Burkina Faso attached great importance to increasing the participation of women in public and political life, and was in the process of re-reading the law on quotas. Ms. Zongo Hien concluded by stressing that the full realization of the rights contained in the Convention was hampered by a range of economic, financial and political constraints, notably poverty, illiteracy, and lack of financial and material resources.

In the discussion that followed, Experts welcomed the efforts to improve the situation of women in Burkina Faso and, recognizing the challenges caused by the activities of non-State armed groups in the north and the Sahel, commended the participation of Burkina Faso in peacekeeping missions, in regional security initiatives, and in welcoming refugees. They inquired about the impact of local and mobile courts on access to justice for women, and raised concern about corruption in the judiciary. Burkina Faso had put in place a number of institutions to promote national reconciliation, social cohesion and understanding between religions, Experts noted and asked about the participation of women in these initiatives and in efforts to counter violent extremism and radicalization. With regard to violence against women and girls, concerns were raised about the continued practice of female genital mutilation and the normalization of domestic violence, as well as about the lack of harmonization between different laws which addressed various forms of violence against women. In the area of health, Experts were worried about the precarious situation of maternal and infant mortality, noting that maternal mortality rates stood at 300 per 100,000 live births. Abortion was criminalized and unsafe abortion was among the leading causes of maternal mortality.

In concluding remarks, Ms. Zongo Hien expressed satisfaction with the quality of the exchange with the Committee Experts during the dialogue and said that Burkina Faso took due note of the Experts’ comments and recommendations.

Dalia Leinarte, Committee Chairperson, commended Burkina Faso for its efforts and encouraged it to address various recommendations which the Committee would issue with the purpose of the more comprehensive implementation of the Convention throughout the State party.

The delegation of Burkina Faso included representatives of the Ministry of Women, National Solidarity and Family; Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Civic Promotion; Ministry of Finance and Development; Ministry of Health; Ministry of National Education and Literacy; Ministry of Public Functions, Labour and Social Protection; Ministry of Agriculture and Housing; National Council to Combat Female Circumcision; and the Permanent Mission of Burkina Faso to the United Nations Office at Geneva.

The Committee will reconvene in public on Wednesday, 25 October, at 10 a.m. to consider the fifth periodic report of Singapore (CEDAW/C/SGP/5).

Report

The seventh periodic report of Burkina Faso is available at this link: CEDAW/C/BFA/7.

Presentation of the Report

LAURE ZONGO HIEN, Minister for Women, National Solidarity and Family of Burkina Faso, said that the report before the Committee had been prepared in a participative and inclusive manner, with public institutions and civil society. Burkina Faso continued to strengthen its legislative and institutional framework for the rights of women and had adopted a number of legal texts, including on the penitentiary regime; on the protection and promotion of older persons; on prevention, repression and reparations for violence against women and girls; and on the protection of children in conflict with the law. In addition, Burkina Faso had promoted policies and strategies to address discrimination against women, and had adopted the national plan for economic and social development 2016-2020, the national strategy for the promotion and protection of girls 2017-2026 and its national action plan 2017-2019, the national strategic plan for the elimination of female genital mutilation, and others. The national commission for the follow-up and implementation of Burkina Faso’s engagement for women (CNSEF) had been created in 2008 and represented an operational tool for follow-up and monitoring. The national human rights commission, under the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Civic Promotion, had a large mandate for the promotion, protection and defence of human rights.

Burkina Faso had taken measures to protect women from domestic violence, early and forced marriage, sexual harassment, and female genital mutilation, including training activities and awareness raising among the population and specific groups. In addition, those phenomena were sanctioned by the law. The national strategy to prevent forced and early marriage adopted in November 2015 envisaged Burkina Faso as a country without any form of child marriage by 2025. One of the most important initiatives to combat gender-based violence was the joint programme with the United Nations agencies to combat violence against women and girls 2014-2015, while a centre for victims of gender-based violence had been created to offer a range of services, including listening, counselling, and integrated victim support. Judicial sentences for female genital mutilation were being increasingly pronounced, while a sanction of one to five years in prison and/or a monetary fine was prescribed by the law for any act of violence against women and girls accused or suspected of witchcraft.

Turning to the fight against trafficking in persons, the Minister said that Burkina Faso had undertaken prevention activities and the provision of services and rehabilitation of victims. Thanks to the work of monitoring committees established at the local and national levels, 1,442 victims of human trafficking had been identified in 2016. They had access to integrated support services and steps were being taken to facilitate their social reintegration. There were ongoing efforts to increase the participation of women in public and political life, including through the ongoing re-reading of the quota law. At the moment, women held seven of the 32 ambassadorial positions, seven of the 29 ministerial positions, 15 of the 127 membership of parliament positions, and four of the 13 regional governors positions. Training in gender-sensitive budgeting was being provided to the gender caucus at the national assembly, and in 2015 the national coordination of women’s organizations had been set up and it had received budgetary allocation for its functioning.

In closing, Ms. Zongo Hien stressed that the Government continued to make efforts to implement the Convention and to improve the situation of women on the ground, adding that Burkina Faso was the second country in Africa to carry out a specific study on discriminatory social institutions, and as a result, had developed a Social Institution Gender Index. The full realization of the rights contained in the Convention was hampered by a range of economic, financial and political constraints, notably poverty, illiteracy, and lack of financial and material resources.

Questions from the Experts

A Committee Expert welcomed the efforts of Burkina Faso to improve the situation of women in the country, and took note of the continuing discrimination they suffered, as well as security, humanitarian and human rights challenges caused by the activities of non-State armed groups in the north of the country.

What was the timeline for the reforms to the Family and Persons Code and the Criminal Code to go through properly and would they actually be adopted by parliament?

The previous national human rights institution had lost its accreditation under the Paris Principles in 2012. The delegation was asked about the steps being taken to ensure that the new national human rights institution received status “A” accreditation and about the practical guarantees that the new national human rights institution would have the mandate to combat violence against women?

On access to justice, were the local rural courts able to overcome the barriers due to distance and did they provide effective access to justice for people from the rural areas? What was in place to ensure women’s access to justice and what measures were being taken to root out corruption from the judiciary?

Another Expert commended the strong participation of Burkina Faso in peacekeeping missions and in regional solidarity initiatives, and its dealing with refugees. In order to counter the impact of terror and violence by non-State armed groups, Burkina Faso had put in place a number of institutions to promote national reconciliation, social cohesion and understanding between religions. What was the legal status of those institutions, what was their composition, and how was the participation of women therein assured?

There were more than 30,000 Malian refugees in Burkina Faso, in addition to internally displaced persons and stateless persons. The Expert commended the recent ratification by Burkina Faso of the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and inquired about the concrete steps taken to ensure its application in practice.

Burkina Faso was for a long time considered an example of religious tolerance; how was this feature of the country being maintained and strengthened given that it was under attack by violent extremism in the north?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation reassured the Committee that Burkina Faso was undertaking measures to implement the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

With regard to the reforms to the Family and Persons Code and the Criminal Code, a delegate explained that those pieces of the legislation were still undergoing amendments in the Council of Ministers and it was hoped that they would soon be presented to the national assembly for adoption.

The delegation said that local and mobile courts were in place and they dealt with cases of female genital mutilation. By organizing rural hearings, Burkina Faso allowed women to have a greater voice and to muster greater support. A legal aid fund had been set up which provided support to all women in need.

As for the timetable for the adoption of the new Constitution, it was not possible to give an exact date, but the Ministry of Women had advocated for the greater inclusion of women in the Constitutional Council. The Constitution would contain new provisions concerning protection from discrimination and violence against women.

The new law on the national human rights institution of 2016 took into account all the recommendations previously given to Burkina Faso on this matter, and the new national human rights commission was currently being set up. There were in total 11 commissioners, who included women. The accreditation process under the Paris Principles would start soon.

Burkina Faso had adopted in 2017 the plan of action for the implementation of the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, which included awareness raising activities among the legal profession, as well as awareness raising for the general population concerning the importance of birth registration.

As for the steps taken to address insecurity in the country, Burkina Faso had put in place a mechanism which sought to address insecurity in the north and in the Sahel. The Ministry for Women had implemented an emergency Sahel programme which sought to assist women and girls, including to access school freely and without fear, and to promote women’s economic empowerment. Women had an important role to play in ensuring the security of their communities and an inter-ministerial project was being developed which would strengthen the role of women in the context of the fight against terrorism and radicalization. The delegation stressed the importance of regional and international solidarity in this context.

Follow-up Questions and Answers

In their follow up questions, Committee Experts asked about the definition of discrimination against women in the legislation, concrete steps taken to combat corruption in the judiciary, and the practical implementation of the legal aid provisions. They also asked about the implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 on women and peace and security, and in particular the participation of women in decision-making in all matters concerning peace and security. What assistance was being provided to Burkinabe stateless persons?

Responding to those questions, the delegation said that Burkina Faso was very aware about the length of the legal reform process and said that time was necessary to look at the issues properly and ensure that nothing was forgotten.

The definition of discrimination was fully in line with the Convention; this definition was contained in the Constitution, Family and Persons Code, Labour Code, and the law on the prevention of violence against women and girls.

Burkina Faso had passed the law in 2015 to prevent and repress corruption, which had criminalized a number of actions. The High Instance of the Magistrate had undertaken a number of activities to address corruption in the judiciary and there were a number of cases, criminal and disciplinary alike, brought against individuals in 2017. The High Council of the State to Combat Corruption was in place and active.

The legal aid fund provided support to women victims of violence who fulfilled the general conditions, notably the poor, widows, and single mothers. The poverty status was proven by a certificate issued by the local council.

A mechanism was in place to allow the reintegration of returnees to Burkina Faso. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had a unit for nationals abroad which facilitated their return and reintegration.

The Ministry for Women, as well as various religious organizations and associations, were actively involved in the implementation of the Sahel G5 initiative. The Ministry was presiding over the Sahel G5 national unit which was a part of the Permanent Secretariat.

Questions from the Experts

In the next round of questions, a Committee Expert took note of the multitude of gender equality mechanisms in Burkina Faso, including the Ministry of Women, National Solidarity and Family, and the National Council for the Advancement of Women. The delegation was asked to clarify the situation of the national gender equality machinery, the relationship between its various institutions, and the coordination mechanism in place. Which per cent of the State budget was allocated for gender equality, and was this the allocation for the Ministry of Women alone, or was it shared – and how – with other gender equality institutions?

The Committee welcomed the initiatives concerning the use of temporary special measures to correct the disparity of representation between women and men, and looking to restore gender equality. The Expert stressed the temporary nature of those measures and that they should be repealed once the aim was achieved.

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation addressed the questions concerning the national gender machinery and explained that the Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for the Advancement of Women, which was within the Ministry of Women, National Solidarity and Family, oversaw all gender-related issues within the Ministry, to ensure that gender was mainstreamed in all policies. Each Ministry had its own gender unit, which also ensured gender mainstreaming in those Ministries. It was important to ensure that gender mainstreaming was not only happening at the Ministerial level but was happening throughout the country.

All those efforts had translated into concrete gains for women, in their day-to-day lives, including through improved access to health and education, access to safe drinking water, and economic empowerment. The Feminine Compendium had been launched in July 2017: any woman could freely register with this database of skills and competences and it allowed Burkina Faso to understand the capacities of its female population.

In follow-up questions, an Expert remarked that Burkina Faso was one of the countries which actively promoted the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and asked what was the relationship between the Sustainable Development Goals and the national development plan? What institutions were in place for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals?

The delegation said that the national plan for economic and social development 2016-2020 contained a strong commitment to the socio-economic development of women, and explained that sectoral plans, fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, were currently being developed. Those plans put accent on the economic empowerment of women, as Burkina Faso believed that this would be the driver for the improvement of the status and rights of women in the country.

Questions from the Experts

A Committee Expert took note of the efforts in Burkina Faso to do away with negative stereotypes and harmful traditional practices, including the criminalization of female genital mutilation and the adoption of the strategic plan to eliminate the phenomenon. Nevertheless, women and girls in Burkina Faso continued to suffer from this practice and other forms of violence, including domestic violence, and early and forced marriages. Furthermore - and this was very worrying – there was a normalization of domestic and familial violence. The root cause of all those forms of violence was gender inequality.

It was commendable that Burkina Faso had adopted a range of laws and strategies to address various forms of violence against women and girls, but the problem remained their sporadic implementation, and the lack of data to show progress.

Another issue was that different forms of violence against women were being addressed by different laws while the link between those different pieces of legislation was not always obvious. For example, female genital mutilation and rape were criminalized by the criminal code, while marital rape was included in the law on violence against women. What steps were being taken to harmonize and coordinate the laws addressing violence against women and girls?

What would be done to further train the judiciary and the legal and police officers to systematically implement the laws addressing violence against women and girls? What services were available to victims of violence against women? What was the status of the helpline, did it function 24/7 and were its staff properly trained?

Another Expert raised questions about the coordination of activities to prevent and supress trafficking in persons in the field, institutions involved and resources allocated.

What data was available about trafficking in persons, and what was the dimension of this problem in the provinces? What support was available from international and regional organizations to combat human trafficking?

The delegation was asked to inform the Committee about the identification of and the support provided to victims of trafficking in persons.

The Committee was worried about the exploitation of homeless children, and Experts asked the delegation about the system in place to protect such children and about the sanctions for the perpetrators of violence against them.

What was being done to reduce the demand for prostitution and to support the social reintegration of prostitutes, including those of foreign origins?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation explained that the criminal code was currently being reviewed, while looking to harmonize different aspects relating to violence against women and girls, including the definition of rape. The Family and Persons Code recognized customary marriages and that was why the Government worked to raise awareness about the law.

As for the exploitation of homeless children, including forcing them to beg, the delegation stressed that the anti-trafficking law prohibited such practices. Prostitution was not criminalized but pimping was. The law on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography strongly sanctioned such crimes.

There were two centres for homeless children in the provinces, and also in Ouagadougou, where these children received shelter and vocational training. Hotlines to report violence against women and girls were in place and operated on a 24/7 basis free of charge.

Follow-up Questions and Answers 

Committee Experts were concerned about human trafficking in Burkina Faso and stressed the importance of awareness of the phenomenon by the country’s diplomats. How many cases of violence had been reported to the hotlines, and what action had been taken?

The delegation had mentioned 13 centres providing emergency care to victims – were those only for victims of violence against women or could they also address the needs of victims of human trafficking and other victims?

What support and alternatives were being offered to women wishing to exit from prostitution? Prostitutes were stigmatised and subjected to violent behaviour – could they freely go to the police to report violence and abuse, and how were they treated by the police officers?

Responding, the delegation said that there were several hotlines: on female genital mutilation, on violence against women, and on human trafficking and trafficking of children in particular. Those hotlines operated 24/7 and structures were in place to process the information received.

As for the definition of marital rape in the law on violence against women and girls, the delegation said that since the adoption of the criminal code in 1991, Burkina Faso had ratified a number of international conventions, thus it was now revising the Criminal Code with those specific provisions. In the law on violence against women and girls, the provisions of marital rape were rather restrictive and it should probably be reviewed.

A plan of action to combat child trafficking was in place, while another plan was being drawn up on the basis of the treaty of friendship and cooperation between Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.

Questions from the Experts

A Committee Expert noted that in 2009, Burkina Faso had adopted a law on quotas in order to increase the representation of women in political and public life, but this and other measures had not brought about the desired changes in the 2015 elections.

What was being done to sanction those who had violated the 2009 law? What measures, other than legislative ones, had been taken to combat prejudices about women in politics and provide women candidates in elections with training and capacity building? Was it true that some women candidates for the 2015 elections had to step down because of threats of violence and harassment?

Why was the number of women ambassadors so low – only seven out of 32? How many women were among the latest recruits to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as young diplomats? What would be done to increase the number of women from Burkina Faso applying for positions in international organizations?

More than 20 per cent of children in Burkina Faso were still not registered at birth, and there was strong geographic disparity in birth registration rates. What was being done to apply new information and communication technology to simplify the birth of a child? By when was Burkina Faso expected to have universal birth registration?

Replies by the Delegation

Responding to the questions and comments made by the Committee Experts, the delegation reassured the Committee that there were sanctions for all political parties which had failed to have 30 per cent representation of women during the 2015 elections. All parties which had failed to apply the quota had up to 50 per cent of their funding withdrawn.

There were no official reports of threats and harassment of female candidates.

An integrated women’s empowerment programme was in place which looked at both their economic and political empowerment, and aimed to increase the representation of women in decision-making processes. The draft law on quotas which had raised the quota for political representation of women from the current 30 to 50 per cent would soon be presented to parliament for adoption.

Out of the seven women ambassadors, five were career diplomats. The recruitment process took into account gender parity and quotas were being taken into account, to ensure that diplomacy was not a male profession. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs worked with the Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for the Advancement of Women to advance the representation of women. A delegate noted that a Burkina Faso woman was a political commissioner in the African Union.

The delegation confirmed that about 20 per cent of children born in Burkina Faso remained unregistered and said that a plan of action 2012-2016 had been launched to address this issue. Efforts to increase the use of information and communication technology in birth registration were ongoing, but there were also underlying challenges in this regard, such as difficult access to electricity, or lack of mobile phones.

Awareness raising campaigns concerning trafficking in persons and risks involved in migrating for work outside of Burkina Faso were being undertaken.

Questions from the Experts

In the next round of questions, a Committee Expert asked about temporary special measures adopted to accelerate gender equality in education and address gender disparity in the middle and higher education, where girls continued to drop out in greater numbers than boys? What was being done to ensure access to school for children, particularly girls, from rural and remote areas, and children from socially marginalized groups?

What was the situation of school drop outs today and what provisions were in place to reduce the number of children dropping out of school and supporting the continuation of education? How were pregnant girls supported to continue their education regardless of pregnancy?

The delegation was asked about sexual education in schools and about the mechanisms in place to prevent sexual harassment and abuse of children in schools, including by their teachers.

Another Expert addressed the issue of women and work and asked about concrete measures in place to increase women’s access to the labour market, and about the mechanism women could recourse to if they were discriminated against in workplaces.

It was fundamental to ensure that women could access professional training and jobs traditionally reserved for men. What steps were being taken to accelerate the ratification of the International Labour Organization Convention 189 concerning decent work for domestic workers?

On health, the delegation was asked about the precarious situation of maternal and infant mortality in Burkina Faso. Maternal mortality rates was still very high, above 300 deaths per 100,000 live births. What was being done to implement the health-related Sustainable Development Goals?

Unsafe abortion was among the leading causes of maternal mortality, said an Expert, noting that abortion was criminalized and could not be carried out voluntarily for any reason. What was the state of play on measures that could be taken at this time to resolve this situation and reduce this particularly high rate of maternal mortality rates in the country? What was the situation of women who were prosecuted for seeking abortion?

Which steps were in place to reduce the still rather high HIV rate among women in prostitution? What strategies and measures were being contemplated to ensure access to contraceptives for unmarried couples and single women?

Eighty per cent of the population lived in rural areas, and unfortunately a good part of the rural population, particularly women, did not enjoy access to quality social services on a par with the urban population. Could the delegation explain what was being done to address this issue, how the rural women accessed health, education and other basic services of good quality, and how they participated in local decision-making bodies?

There were significant problems with land, Experts noted and recognized the Governmental decision to ensure that at least 30 per cent of the land was allocated to women. What was the state of implementation of this decision, and how could rural women access credit?

Turning to women from disadvantaged groups, an Expert asked about the situation of albino women, steps taken to put an end to the tradition of treating elderly women as witches, and action taken to address the issues that women deprived of liberty faced, including supporting them in their social integration.

What projects for the future were in place to assist the population displaced or otherwise affected by the activities of mining companies?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation responded to questions raised on education and said that the gap between rural and urban areas in terms of the number of schools was closing. Sexual education was a part of the curriculum, where students studied the so-called emergent issues, and the delegation stressed that talking about sexual education was not a taboo any longer.

There were mechanisms in place which women could use in matters of discrimination in the workplace. The labour code prohibited sexual harassment in the workplace; all violations of this provision could be taken up under the law on the prevention and suppression of violence against women. No date had been set for the ratification of the International Labour Organization Convention 189 on domestic work, but this was one of the demands of the trade unions in the country.

There were three main ways to obtain land in the rural areas: by inheritance, by employment and by time. Over 60 per cent of men and over 40 per cent of women who owned their plots obtained them through inheritance.

The national plan for accelerating family planning had been recently adopted. It contained measures to improve access of women to contraception and to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child. Community-based health providers 
had been trained as well. In 2016, 76 women had died because of abortion in rural areas and abortion represented the fifth cause of maternal deaths.

Officials from the Ministry for Women were present in all places of detention throughout the country. Food assistance was provided to ensure that detained women had access to nutritious food. The law on penitentiary had been adopted and it took into account the recommendations Burkina Faso had received in relation to the situation of persons deprived of liberty. It contained innovations concerning the detention of women, particularly pregnant women and those who had recently given birth.

Universal health insurance was not fully operational as yet; the system sought to put in place a unique system for all vulnerable groups. A fund would be set up to operationalize the universal health insurance.

In order to reduce the number of girls dropping out of schools, various measures were in place to support parents to ensure that girls were in school. Usually, girls dropping out due to pregnancy returned to school, and there were systems in place to care for the children.

Questions from the Experts

Gender equality was guaranteed in the Constitution of Burkina Faso and in a number of laws such as the Family and Persons Code, the Labour Code and the Criminal Code. However, some provisions that discriminated against women remained, for example the legal age of marriage remained at 17 for girls and 20 for boys, while the age of marriage could be further lowered to 15 for girls and 18 for boys under some circumstances. Also, polygamy was admitted under certain conditions, and polygamous unions were widespread, particularly in rural areas.

What was being done to raise the legal age of marriage and equalize it for girls and boys? What was the plan concerning the repeal of all discriminatory legal provisions from the Family and Persons Code which was currently being revised?

Responses by the Delegation

The delegation explained that the Government provided assistance in obtaining documents for marriage, and also assisting couples in recognizing their unions as civil marriages. The reforms to the Family and Persons Code were still being defined and the delegation was not able to confirm that all discriminatory provisions would be removed. The revised law would equalize the legal age of marriage for girls and boys which would be at 18 years of age. Polygamy was a long-standing traditional practice and efforts were ongoing to raise awareness among the population.

Concluding Remarks

LAURE ZONGO HIEN, Minister for Women, National Solidarity and Family of Burkina Faso, expressed satisfaction with the quality of the exchange with the Committee Experts during the dialogue and said that Burkina Faso took due note of the Experts’ comments and recommendations.

DALIA LEINARTE, Committee Chairperson, commended Burkina Faso for its efforts and encouraged it to address various recommendations which the Committee would issue with the purpose of the more comprehensive implementation of the Convention throughout the State party.

2349029,"Myanmar: UN experts request exceptional report on situation of women and girls from northern Rakhine State GENEVA (28 November 2017) – A group of UN experts tasked with monitoring a global treaty on discrimination against women has requested an exceptional report from the Government of Myanmar on the situation of Rohingya women and girls from northern Rakhine State.

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) made the decision at a regular meeting in Geneva last week, setting a six-month deadline for the submission of the report to the UN Secretary General. The request was sent to the Government of Myanmar on Monday, meaning the report should be submitted by 28 May 2018. It is only the fourth time an exceptional report has been requested by the Committee since holding its first session in October 1982.

The Committee, comprised of 23 independent human rights experts drawn from around the world, called on the Government to provide information on a range of issues surrounding alleged instances of violence against women and girls in northern Rakhine State in recent months.

As a party to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Myanmar is obliged to report to the Committee on its implementation of the treaty.

The Committee requested information concerning cases of sexual violence, including rape, against Rohingya women and girls by State security forces; and to provide details on the number of women and girls who have been killed or have died due to other non-natural causes during the latest outbreak of violence.

It also requested information on investigations, arrests, prosecutions, convictions and sentences or disciplinary measures imposed on perpetrators, including members of the armed forces, found guilty of such crimes.

The Committee also requested information on:

the designation of the battalions that have undertaken the clearance operations in Northern Rakhine State since 25 August 2017 and under whose command;    
the findings of the final report of the Tatmadaw investigation team led by Lieutenant-General Aye Whin concerning the conduct of the armed forces during the security clearance operations;

the gender-specific measures taken by the State party to rehabilitate and compensate Rohingya women and girls who are victims/survivors of such violence;    
the remedies available to Rohingya women and girls to claim violations of their rights;    
the number of Rohingya women and girls currently detained by State security forces;    
the number of Rohingya women and girls who have died during childbirth;    
the number of clinics providing obstetric services and the ratio of doctors and midwives to the Rohingya population; and    
the number of Rohingya families displaced by the violence, disaggregated by sex, and measures taken by the Government to ensure their voluntary and safe return, economic reintegration and compensation for loss of land or property.

The report of the Government shall be made public, and will be reviewed by CEDAW. For further information, please contact Mr. Anganile Mwenifumbo (amwenifumbo@ohchr.org /+41229179337)

**Background**

CEDAW is composed of 23 independent human rights experts drawn from around the world, who serve in their personal capacity and not as representatives of States parties. Countries who have become party to the treaty (States parties) are obliged to submit regular reports to the Committee on how the rights of the Convention are implemented. However, pursuant to article 18, paragraph 1(b), of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (Convention) and decision 21/I dated 17 November 2018 that was adopted during the sixty-eighth session, CEDAW decided to request the Government of Myanmar to submit an exceptional report, within six months, on the ongoing situation of Rohingya women and girls from Northern Rakhine State. The exceptional report, which will be due on 28 May 2018, should be submitted to the Secretary General of the United Nations as required by article 18, paragraph 1 of the Convention.

The publication “Preventing violence against women in elections: A programming guide”, jointly produced by UN Women and UNDP, brings to light the scourge of violence against women in elections.

It seeks to identify the specific components of violence against women in elections, including types, tactics, victims and perpetrators, and presents options for policy and programming responses based on current good practices. It also provides examples of definitions and methods from all regions that may prompt ideas for actions according to each country’s national context.

This guide is intended for those best positioned to prevent and mitigate violence against women in elections, including national electoral stakeholders, international organizations such as UNDP, UN Women and other UN agencies, as well as those providing programming support on electoral assistance, women’s political participation, human rights monitoring and ending violence against women. It will also be a resource for members and especially leaders of political parties, electoral management bodies, civil society organizations, women’s groups and gender equality activists.",4594,"Gender"
2346874,"Gender: Different needs, adapted assistance - ECHO Factsheet (November 2017) **Key messages**

- Natural disasters and man-made crises are not gender neutral: they have a different impact on women, girls, boys and men. Their differentiated needs and specific vulnerabilities during and in the aftermath of crises need therefore to be addressed accordingly.

- The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid highlights the importance of integrating gender considerations, including protection strategies against sexual and gender based violence and promoting the active participation of women affected by crisis in the humanitarian response.

- The EU considers gender-based violence (GBV) a serious humanitarian issue, and is committed to support survivors and eradicate such violence.  
It aims to do so inter alia as lead of the 'Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies', a global initiative which strives to ensure that every humanitarian effort, from the earliest phases of a crisis, includes the policies, systems and mechanisms to mitigate GBV risks, and to provide safe and comprehensive services for those affected by GBV.

- The EU is fully committed to ensuring that its humanitarian aid takes into account the different vulnerabilities and capacities of women and men of all ages. This is reflected in its commitment to quality programming of aid for the most disadvantaged in emergencies. It is also in compliance with the EU humanitarian mandate and international humanitarian law and commitments.

- Projects that do not take into account gender considerations risk not reaching those that need aid most. This can lead to providing support in an inadequate manner, or even to inadvertently doing harm.",4594,"Gender"
2344694,"AU Mission in Somalia launches 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence **Mogadishu, 25 November 2017** – The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) today launched the ‘16 Days Activism Against Gender-Based Violence’ campaign, aimed at preventing and eliminating violence against women and girls in Somalia.

The campaign, launched by the AU Mission simultaneously in Somalia’s regional capitals, is part of a global campaign to create awareness about some of the most widespread human rights violations.

The global theme of the campaign this year is “Leave No One Behind – End Violence Against Women And Girls”.

“The overall theme correlates to AMISOM’s role as a peace support operation, in which we support the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Member States to provide a secure environment where children feel safe to go to school; where civilians can thrive and go about their daily activities unhindered; where communities appreciate the civil liberties that come with the presence of peace and security,” said Ms. Christine Alalo, AMISOM Deputy Police Commissioner, during the launch of the campaign, in Mogadishu.

Ms. Alalo urged victims of gender-based violence to speak out and break the silence on these violations.

“When we keep quiet and don’t talk about it, then we are also perpetrators of gender-based violence,” Ms. Alalo remarked.

AMISOM is committed  to ending violence against women and girls, considered as the most extreme form of discrimination; and subscribes to the ideals enshrined in the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa; the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child; the AU Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa; the Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa and Declaration 229 (X11) adopted by the AU proclaiming 2010-2020 as the African Women’s Decade, as well as other international conventions on human rights.

According to a 2016 UN report based on data from 87 countries, 19 percent of women aged between 15 and 49 years, have experienced physical and/or sexual violence.

According to the report, harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, which is still widely practised in Somalia, and is considered an extreme case of violence against women, has declined by 24 per cent worldwide, although prevalence remains high in at least 30 countries.

Research shows that achieving gender equality helps in preventing conflict, and high rates of violence against women.",4594,"Gender"
2344689,"Gender Profile #1 for Rohingya Refugee Crisis Response - Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh (as of 3 December 2017) **Context Overview for Gender Equality among Rohingya**

While there are variations based on levels of education, wealth, and urban vs rural context, gender segregation is generally common amongst the Muslim Rohingya population, closely connected to conservative cultural and religious practices such as the practice of purdah. Women and girls are generally expected to stay in the home and be close to their family, whereas men and boys are more present in the public sphere. When girls reach puberty, they are more likely to be separated from boys, and parents will mostly not send their young girls to educational or recreational activities unless they are segregated. The majority of girls do not attend school beyond grade 5 and those who do attend up to grade 5 are usually from higher income families. This is also against a backdrop where education beyond Grade 5 is not permitted for refugee children. In 2010, more than half of boys and girls age 10-15 in Rakhine State, Myanmar, are out of school, including 57% of girls and 49% of boys (an 8% gap). This is exacerbated by security concerns where women and girls are kept home to protect them from harassment and other forms of gender based violence or violent attacks. However, even before reaching puberty, there is gendered divisions among children - girls are oriented towards the home e.g., washing, cleaning and feeding backyard animals, whilst boys perform tasks such as fetching water. Boys are more likely to play and engage outside.

Marriage is very important for the Rohingya and for women it is often the only way they will achieve a sense of social and economic security given that they are discouraged from working. Upon marriage, a woman becomes the responsibility of the husband’s family; in addition to her husband, she becomes the responsibility of her mother-in-law who gives guidance on behaviour, childcare and other gendered tasks. The median age for women’s marriage in Rakhine State in 2016 was 20.7 years. There is evidence that child, early and forced marriage is commonplace among the Rohingya population9 and that both child marriage and polygamy has been increasing in recent years among Rohingya populations due to the scarcity of men and to economic difficulties which mean girls are forced into adult roles sooner. In addition, a UNHCR report from 2016 shows that more than half of Rohingya girls who have fled Myanmar since 2012, married prior to the age of 18. Polygamy and child marriage is not only an element of culture, but also as an adaptation for the lack of funds to pay for schooling. A 2015 gender analysis study, which included a focused group discussion and key informant interviews among the 3,000 Rohingya refugees who were then living in Cox’s Bazar’s official refugee camps, revealed that 94 per cent of women respondents reported that they did not make decisions about their current marriage, and that 45 per cent were married as children. The difficult circumstances in the camps may mean that parents push their daughters to get married earlier than they would have otherwise, because they cannot afford to provide for them. Even though Islamic law does not allow for dowry, it is common for the family of the bride to pay dowry to the husband’s family. Dowry is also practiced in the camps in Bangladesh, even though it is still illegal there.

The Gender Profile for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis Response in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, was prepared by the Inter-sector Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group (GiHA WG) in Cox’s Bazar, co-led by UN Women and UNHCR with technical support from inter-agency Gender Capacity Adviser (GENCAP). The GiHA WG is comprised of sector gender focal points and gender advisers engaged in the response from across NGOs, INGOs, Red Cross/Red Crescent Society, and the UN. The purpose of the gender profile is to present a summary context overview gender analysis as well as key gender-related information on key needs, issues, gaps, response actions taken and recommended further actions within all sectors, sub-sectors, inter-sector working groups and cross-cutting coordination to ensure gender-responsive humanitarian actions in this crisis response. The profile was endorsed by the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) in Cox’s Bazar on 3 December 2017 and is intended to guide the integration of gender equality and gender mainstreaming across the humanitarian programme cycle of the ISCG.",4594,"Gender"
2343469,"Gender and Social Inclusion in Local Water Planning: Lessons from Water Use Master Plan Practices in Nepal **Foreword**

The water resources and freshwater ecosystems in the transboundary river basins of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) are a source of survival and other livelihoods opportunities for people. Though the region is known for a physical abundance of water, the reality is that most communities in the basin still live in a state of water poverty. They face serious challenges of water scarcity and water-induced disasters caused by both climatic factors and human impacts.  

Competition for access to and control of water increases the likelihood of water conflicts in the region. Existing water inequities are further aggravated by persisting disparities in gender, class, caste, location and power politics.  

Since its establishment in 1983, ICIMOD has dedicated considerable effort to improving the lives of women and men of the region. Achieving gender equality in HKH is one of ICIMOD’s key goals in the countries of the HKH that also suffer from increased water scarcity and water induced disaster.  
In water scarce situations and water-induced disasters, gender sensitive water planning at local level is crucial.  

One local planning practice in Nepal is preparation of water use master plans (WUMP) for the village development committee. ICIMOD’s Koshi Basin Programme in partnership with HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation Nepal has been piloting the WUMPs in the mountains, hills and floodplains of the Koshi basin in Nepal since 2013 to increase the participation and role of women and marginalized groups in local water planning and decision making.

2343074,"Making health services a safe place for women: Uganda steps up to support women subjected to violence Violence against women is a global public health problem. In Uganda, more than half of all women have experienced violence at least once in their life, most likely from an intimate partner, leaving them feeling unsafe in the place they should feel the safest – their home.

“Violence against women is everywhere in Uganda,” says Dr Olive Sentumbwe, National Professional Officer, WHO Uganda. “Women from all parts of society experience repeated abuse, which takes a toll on their physical and mental health.”

Violence often remains hidden, as survivors fear for their safety or are stigmatized. Very few women seek any help. Those that do seek professional help are likely to turn to their local health facilities since they can address their immediate physical or mental health needs, such as treatment for injuries or access to emergency contraception.

Women who have experienced violence are more likely to contract sexually-transmitted infections including HIV, suffer injuries, have an alcohol use disorder, experience depression, attempt suicide, or suffer other health consequences, so the health system is a key player in supporting survivors.

**Working to eliminate a country-wide issue**

To address the issue, the Ugandan Ministry of Gender, Labour, and Social Development, along with the ministries of health, justice and education, among others, have developed the National Action Plan on the Elimination of Gender-based Violence. The Action Plan focuses on implementing the country’s laws and policies on domestic violence and marital rape, providing health services for survivors, raising awareness and training police and health workers on how to respond.

In 2015, WHO worked with the Ministry of Health to update its national gender-based violence training manual. This manual is now used alongside WHO’s clinical and policy guidelines and its clinical handbook on responding to intimate partner violence and sexual violence in weeklong workshops to train health care providers, community leaders and workers in the judicial system on how to deliver services to survivors of violence.

To date more than 400 health workers have been trained across the country, helping to build a network of people committed to addressing violence against women.

One nurse who attended a training session in 2016 said, “The clinical handbook has empowered me with skills to identify that one is a victim to violence, and I am now able to examine, give proper treatment and refer whenever need arises.”

Health facilities in the country are equipped to provide a minimum initial package of care to survivors of rape, including emergency contraception, HIV post-exposure prophylaxis and mental health support – as recommended by WHO guidelines.

WHO has also developed an advocacy toolkit and launched a gender-based violence champions group in 2014 to sensitize policymakers and advocate for a stronger government response.

“There are now more incidents of violence disclosed to professional services throughout the country, which is a good sign that we are making progress,” says Dr Abdoulie Dodou Jack, Acting WHO Representative in Uganda. “We don’t know yet if behaviour is changing or whether incidence has dropped, but we do know that media coverage of the issue has increased, further raising community awareness.”

**A global issue**

Violence against women is not only a problem in Uganda; it’s a problem around the world. Globally approximately one woman in every three has experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence by someone else at some point in their lives.

In 2016, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system to address interpersonal violence in particular, against women and girls, and against children. One part of the plan encourages countries to enhance health service delivery and the capacity of health care providers to support survivors, as Uganda has done.

WHO just published a new manual, “Strengthening health systems to respond to women subjected to intimate partner violence or sexual violence,” which provides a “how-to” guide for health managers and policy-makers for planning, managing and monitoring services for women who have been subjected to violence.

“Health services have a crucial role in responding to violence against women,” says Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, who leads work at WHO on violence against women. “This guide is a practical tool for helping countries provide women subjected to violence with quality care and ensure their privacy, confidentiality and rights.”",4594,"Gender"
2342784,"Jonglei women appealing for greater role in ending conflict and building peace in South Sudan *Mach Samuel*

Women in the Jonglei region want the opportunity to play a greater role in resolving ongoing violence and building sustainable peace in South Sudan.

Speaking at a one-day forum in Bor, organized by the Gender Affairs unit of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the women urged warring parties to end the conflict which has taken a huge toll on women and children across the country.

The forum provided an opportunity to discuss the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), which reaffirms the important role of women in preventing and resolving conflict, peace negotiations, and post-conflict reconstruction. It urges an increase in the participation of women and incorporation of gender perspectives in peace and security efforts.

Members of security forces, political, women and youth leaders participated in the forum and supported the call by the women’s group for greater participation in the peace process.

The civil war which erupted in 2013 has left the country in a dire humanitarian and economic situation with millions of people displaced either internally or having fled to neighbouring countries to escape the violence.

The chair of the Jonglei Women’s Association, Rachiel Akuach, said the war must end now so that sustainable peace and development can occur across South Sudan.

“If the war comes, we are the one who are affected. Our children are dying and our men,” she said. “So now, we want to do this, for war to end so that we can accept peace. We can join together for a better South Sudan to develop in peace.”

The leadership forum focused on building knowledge about the four pillars of UNSCR 1325, including ways that women can actively and meaningfully engage in the prevention, resolution and management of conflict.

It also brought together actors from across the community to support the recommendations of the women and their involvement in the prevention of, and response to, gender-based violence.

Speaking at the forum, Brigadier General Peter Maliet, from the local prison service appealed to his colleagues across the security sector to treat all people with dignity and respect.

“It is us (the organized forces) who are imposing the law. Societies in general all over the world are looking for peace but who is going to implement it? It is us, the organized forces. Even if someone is arrested, we (must) treat him as human, as a member of South Sudan,” he said.

UNMISS Officer in Charge in Jonglei, Isidore Boutche, said a collective effort was needed to end violence against women and girls.

“The ongoing conflict in South Sudan has taken its toll on women. Women’s groups, networks, and all stakeholders have a critical role to play in the peace process. The UN is here to support you and we do hope your contributions will set the pace for committed actions from all areas and at all levels,” she said.",4594,"Gender"
2341124,"AMISOM trains Somali security forces on engendering women in the sector Mogadishu, 22 November 2017 – The African Union Mission in Somalia is facilitating a two-day workshop for members of the Somali National Security Forces, on how to engender women and support the integration of gender issues at work.

The training of at least 32 security sector personnel drawn from the Federal Government and federal member states, is supported by the British Embassy in Somalia.

While opening the workshop in the capital today, Ambassador Francisco Caetano Madeira, the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the AU Commission (SRCC) for Somalia, said the training will align the Somali security forces to the global and regional frameworks, established by the African Union and the United Nations.

“The UN Security Council Resolution 2372 in (extending) the new mandate for AMISOM, places emphasis on upholding accountability, accountable security forces that comply with international obligations, particularly International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law. Protection of women and gender equality is paramount,” Ambassador Madeira stated in his remarks.

The training which will be rolled out in the federal member states, is part of AMISOM’s gender capacity building project for the Somali security sector.

Mr. Jim Haggerty, the Somalia Conflict, Security and Stability Fund (SCCF)Programme Lead & Stabilization Adviser at the British Embassy, committed to the project’s continued support.

“We will as far as we can, continue to support this initiative and other initiatives which flow from it, in the months and hopefully years ahead,” he said.

The Deputy Minister of Defence from the Federal Government Mr. Olad Abdullahi Roobe acknowledged the importance of providing equitable opportunities to women, especially in decision making positions.

“If there are no rights for women, then there are no rights for all humanity. If we safeguard the rights of women, that’s when we can say that we have safeguarded the rights of all humanity,” he told participants at the workshop.

“That’s why it is important for us to come out and promote women rights”.",4594,"Gender"

**The realization of women’s rights and gender justice in the Middle East and North Africa is inseparably entwined with conflict resolution and peace building efforts explains Farah Kobaissy.**

_“No matter where you are, everyone says that now is not the time to talk about these issues. There is no such thing as women’s rights. We are in times of war, there is a massive humanitarian crisis. They say now is not the time.”- Yemeni Activist_

Oxfam and International Alert’s report [Now is the Time](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/rr-gender-justice-conflict-fragility-mena-050617-en.pdf) summarizes the issues faced by gender justice activists in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) before, during and after recent periods of crisis and vulnerability. The research, covering Yemen, Iraq, Egypt and Occupied Palestine, explores several questions:

What entities attempt to fill the vacuum left by collapsed states? What positions, discourses and actions do they adopt towards gender justice? What are the consequences on civil society and women’s rights organizations’ (WROs) ability to deliver a gender justice agenda? How can WROs advance women’s rights in this new context? What is the role of international development actors?

**The promise and the legacy of the Arab Uprisings**

The uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Yemen, and Syria saw an unprecedented involvement of women in the public sphere, representing a rupture in existing systems and allowing for new possibilities in knowledge and discourse on social and gender justiceissues. This came about through grassroots organizing and through the relentless efforts of women to push for women’s rights as a priority on the political agenda.

Women’s rights movement in MENA have pushed the state to recognize, for example, sexual violence as a fundamental problem, following years of prolonged denial. In Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon, the Penal Code was reformed on domestic violence, underage marriage and honor crimes, after decades of struggle. But, as feminist activists note, “These achievements came at the hands of largely undemocratic regimes, so they are fragile and vulnerable to revocation at any moment”.

With the defeat of the 2011 Arab Uprisings and the advancement of a counter revolution, the millions of voices which occupied the public squares of cities across MENA were hijacked by the causes of the old regime, or ‘deep state’, and violent fundamentalism. This has hindered any foreseeable victory, or even maintenance of gains, in the gender justice agenda.

**State control of the gender justice agenda**

Historically, the regimes in our region have succeeded in containing the women’s rights movement by co-opting its discourse, this is known as “state feminism”. Often, the reforms come with unjust economic policies that impoverish women and a repressive agenda that increases public sphere militarization, stifles political action, and represses opposition. WROs have experienced restrictions, threats; travel bans, detentions, confiscation of headquarters, and closures, hindering the development of grassroots organizations that emerged during the uprisings. The development of women’s movements cannot flourish under despotism. A fundamental link exists between women’s rights movements and social movements at large.

Gender equality and justice are not a priority for local and government actors, who are primarily concerned with maintaining power and increasing their monopoly over resources, particularly in conflict settings. However, gendered structures precede conflict and are merely reinforced within it. Existing gender injustice in “normal times” increases with increasing violence. Local and international practitioners and supporters must understand the structural dimensions of gender inequalities that exist before conflict begins. Sustainable solutions that radically transform the reality of women require a radical change in the social, political and economic structures that drive injustice.

**Lack of support for women’s rights from donors and INGOs**

Donors and international NGOs inadvertently hinder gender justice, exerting a disproportionate influence on the priorities and opportunities of WROs. Many WROs in Iraq, Yemen, and the Gaza Strip have transitioned to humanitarian programming to secure funds, putting gender development work on hiatus. Donor priorities have overwhelmingly shifted towards providing funds for humanitarian aid, creating further difficulties for WROs.

Moreover, the actions and discourse of the international community are often contradictory to the objectives of gender equality, human rights and democratization more broadly. International actors often fail to address or deal with the structural issues that hinder gender justice.

**Women’s movements are key to peace building**

Finally, local and international actors continue to marginalize the role of women in humanitarian response and their participation in negotiations and conflict resolution mechanisms. Women are told that “now is not the time” when they assert their right to participate in peace talks, negotiations and governance processes. The marginalization of women’s movements contributes to the reproduction of gendered violence dynamics in times of peace and to the culture of impunity.

The active participation and inclusion of both women and men is key to ensuring that the peace process is fair and sustainable. Transitional and future economic and social policies must include the restoration of safety and the adjustment of social and gender inequalities. National stability and justice should not be prioritized at the expense of citizens’ social and economic security to prevent destabilization. Gender justice must be a priority both during conflict and beyond. Now is the time.",4594,"Gender"

2333849,"The Humanitarian Impact of Drones “In Pakistan, things fall out of the sky all the time,” said Pervez Musharraf, the country’s former president. He was talking about the very first drone strikes being initiated in his country by the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States, in 2004.

Since then, over 700 air and drone strikes have taken place across Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. Since 2015, over 3,000 strikes have taken place in Afghanistan potentially causing the deaths of up to 1,400 civilians. The harm to people, places, and communities at the local, national, and international level is manifold and multi-faceted encompassing physical and psychological trauma, as well as raising serious questions about human rights, international law, ethics, and government transparency.

This is the reason why WILPF’s disarmament programme has published a new book, *The Humanitarian Impact of Drones.* One of the key objectives of the book is to refocus the debate about armed drones on the harm caused to people, disrupting narratives that emphasise the “low human costs” of deploying explosive force from drones as well as shift the burden of proof onto users of armed drones, putting pressure on them to justify their policies and practices. Through country and regional case studies, as well as personal stories, the book illustrates the multiple humanitarian effects of armed drone use as well as explore dimensions of the problem that are seemingly overlooked by policymakers or media in their coverage of the issue.

It also takes a close look at gendered aspects of drone use in a chapter authored by the director of WILPF’s disarmament programme, Ray Acheson—an aspect frequently overlooked in mainstream commentary on this issue. She illustrates that drones should be viewed through a gender perspective to help situate in them in the broader context of militarism and the culture of violence, and highlights ways in which the use of drones can constitute gender-based violence and undermine gender equality. “Gender analysis should not be a footnote. It offers specific tools that can help unpack or understand more fully the ways drones are perceived by users and victims; the physical and psychological responses to the use of armed drones; and the situational context of drones in terms of military technology as well as gender relations,” writes Ms. Acheson.

The book has been published at an opportune time, when not many countries yet possess or use armed drones but are on the verge of acquiring them. The United States, by far the world’s largest user of armed drones, is attempting to develop international guidelines to regulate their export through a process that has been largely secretive and closed to civil society. WILPF signed a [joint open letter](http://reachingcriticalwill.org/news/latest-news/11875-joint-civil-society-statement-on-the-us-led-drone-export-initiative) from multiple civil society organisations in September as the only way to register input to that process. It was published around the same time that US President Trump [announced](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/loosen-obama-limits-drone-strikes-170922141205178.html) that he would like to relax some of the policies and limitations used in drone strike targeting and decision-making, in order to expedite those processes. The number of US-led drone strikes have spiked since he took office.

Joy Onesoh, President of WILPF Nigeria, authored a case study about Nigeria, which is the eighth country to use armed drones in combat. “As a Nigerian, I have a number of additional concerns about potential effects of the use of drones. These include the potential harms on the environment, human health, and agriculture,” she writes. “Drone activities, in particular their munitions and the munitions used against them, may pose a threat to public health within these regions and their sources of livelihood: the cultivation of crops and rearing of animals.”

The book was launched at an event in New York in October that involved several of the authors and editors. It is published jointly with Article 36 and the International Disarmament Institute at Pace University. It is available online at http://reachingcriticalwill.org/news/latest-news/11961-new-publication-the-humanitarian-impact-of-drones and Reaching Critical Will intends to organize further events and opportunities in 2018 to present and explore its content.",4594,"Gender"
2332514,"IOM Undertakes Survey to Improve Prevention and Response to Gender-Based Violence in South Sudan Juba – Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is endemic in South Sudan, where years of crisis have increased the vulnerability of women and girls. The scale of violence against women and girls in conflict and humanitarian settings is increasingly recognized as one of the most concerning human rights violations.

To better understand knowledge of gender-based violence and improve prevention and response in South Sudan, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in coordination with partners, undertook a large-scale study of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to GBV.

This represents gathering of the first comprehensive data on GBV among internally displaced persons (IDPs), host communities and key populations in South Sudan to become widely available. The KAP survey collected baseline information about current knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding GBV and sexual health, gender norms, knowledge of and access to services.

The study, which interviewed over 3,200 people, used quantitative and qualitative research, focusing on the experiences of women, girls and men, with a particular focus on populations of humanitarian concern and areas of high HIV prevalence in Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Unity, Upper Nile, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Western Equatoria states.

The findings: IOM’s survey results indicate a generally high level of awareness about the term GBV among the population. Sadly, this may be due to a high occurrence of such activity. According to the survey, 48 per cent of female respondents reported a woman or girl in their household experiencing some form of GBV, just in the past 12 months.

“The findings of this survey offer us a major step forward in informing GBV prevention and response activities in South Sudan,” said IOM South Sudan Chief of Mission, William Barriga, at the validation workshop of the survey on 16 November. “Equipped with this, often disheartening information, stakeholders dedicated to GBV prevention and response efforts will be able to accelerate awareness activities and mobilize resources to help protect this country’s most vulnerable.”

GBV can have devastating impacts. It can result in long-term physical, psychological and social traumas that affect individuals and their families and communities for decades.  In South Sudan, the effects are further compounded by lack of access to appropriate health care and psychological support.

The large-scale survey was supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria through the UN Development Programme, and through coordination with the GBV Sub-Cluster, the South Sudan AIDS Commission and the South Sudan ministries of Health and Gender, Child and Social Affairs.

*Message by Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN Women for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, 25 November 2017*

Date: Thursday, November 16, 2017

The initial response to the outpouring of ‘#MeToo’ around the world has been of outrage at the scale of sexual abuse and violence revealed. The millions of people joining the hashtag tide showed us how little they were heard before. They poured through the floodgate, opening up conversations, naming names and bolstering the frailty of individual statements with the robustness of a movement.

This virtual class action has brought strength to those whose stories would otherwise have not been told. Sexual violence in private almost always ends up as one person’s word against another, if that word is ever spoken. Even sexual violence in public has been impossible to call out when society does not view rape as a male crime but as a woman’s failing, and views that woman as dispensable.

We are seeing the ugly face of violence brought out into the light: the abuses of power that repress reporting and diminish the facts, and that exclude or crush opposition. These acts of power draw from the same roots, whether they concern the murder of a woman human rights defender standing up against big business interests in the Amazon basin, a young refugee girl forced to have sex for food or supplies, or a small business employee in London forced out of her job for being ‘difficult’, after reporting the sexual misconduct of her supervisor. In each case, and over and over, these acts of abuse have stemmed from a confidence that there will be no significant reprisal, no law invoked, no calling to account. 

But everyone has the right to live their life without the threat of violence. This holds for all people, no matter what their gender, age, race, religion, ethnicity or caste, and irrespective of their income level, sexual orientation, HIV status, citizenship, where they live, or any other characteristic of their identity.

Violence against women and girls is not inevitable. There are many ways to prevent violence in the first place and to stop cycles of violence repeating.

As a society, we can support the passing and implementation of laws to protect girls and women from child marriage, FGM, domestic violence, sexual assault and harassment, and we can agitate for their impact to be properly monitored and evaluated.

The provision of essential services for survivors of violence must be comprehensive, multi-sectoral, non-judgmental, of good quality and accessible to everyone, with no exceptions. These services are the frontline of response to those whose lives have just been ruptured; they must have the survivor’s dignity and safety as central concerns. 

Prevention of violence must begin early. The education system and teachers themselves are at the forefront of children and young people learning to carry forward the principles of equality, respect and non-violence for future generations. This takes appropriate curricula and role model behaviour.

What #MeToo has shown clearly is that everyone has a part to play in changing our society for the better. We must speak out against harassment and violence in our homes, workplaces, in our institutions, social settings and through our media. #MeToo has also shown us that no one is immune. All institutions need to be aware of the potential for violence to occur among their staff. With that knowledge, we must take steps to prevent it, and at the same time be well prepared to respond appropriately.

In this broad effort to end violence against women and girls, we see men as playing a vital role in bringing change. Challenging sexism, male dominance and male privilege as society’s norm starts with modeling positive masculinities. Parents can instill principles of equality, rights and respect as they raise their sons; and men can call out their peers for the behaviours that are now being understood as the unacceptable tip of the harassment iceberg.

At the heart of today’s theme of ‘leaving no one behind’, is leaving no one out. This means bringing women and girls as equals into everything that concerns them, and planning solutions to end violence with those who have been previously dismissed, sidelined or excluded. 

As a global community, we can act now to end violence against women and girls, to change institutions and work together to end discrimination, restore human rights and dignity, and leave no one behind.",4594,"Gender"

2329379,"The Citizens’ Manifesto: a new hope for democracy in Sierra Leone? **15 November 2017:** The political lens is zooming in on Sierra Leone as the country is poised to hold its next presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for March 2018. As political debates intensify, a new document launched by civil society is seen as new hope for democracy and peace. Abdul Brima examines its priority areas.

The political atmosphere is heating up in Sierra Leone as the two leading parties, the ruling All People’s Congress (APC) and the main opposition Sierra Leone Peoples’ Party (SLPP), present their presidential hopefuls for the 2018 elections. Observers and political pundits anticipate a tightly contested battle for the presidency in next year’s elections given the formation of another viable political party with former United Nations Diplomat, Dr. Kandeh Kolleh Yumkella, viewed as its potential flagbearer.  

As the political drama unfolds, civil society organisations (CSOs) have been busy traversing the length and breadth of the country, running advocacy campaign to educate young people about the power of their vote.

**Citizens’ Manifesto: a new manifesto for peace?**

A leading consortium, Standing Together for Democracy, comprised of civil society organisations (CSOs), carried out a nationwide survey with hundreds of youth actively involved in the outcome of a Citizens’ Manifesto tagged: “My Vote, My Life”.

The manifesto pushes for political reforms that lead to inclusivity and accountability in political parties’ activities ahead of the 2018 elections, and aims to change the “face and purpose of politics in Sierra Leone” for the better.

For a country that is ranked at the bottom of the human development index, the document notes, it is easy for everything to become a priority. This “Citizens’ Manifesto” is useful because it gives direction to aid development and reduces prospects for conflict at a time when political parties are preparing their campaigns.

**Development for peace**

Development and political analysts think the scope for meaningful development in a country that has experienced eleven years of brutal civil conflict will be greater if Sierra Leone can pivot its current political culture away from tribal and regional division.

Even after the civil war and the catastrophic destruction caused by the Ebola virus, violent clashes have persisted between party supporters in all parts of the country. The Standing Together for Democracy consortium believes violence and political division increases spending on security agencies and diverts funds away from addressing poverty.  

The consortium says fears about political violence in 2018 are well founded as political parties have in the past mobilised votes on identity and used ethnicity to manipulate voters. The hope for the implementation of the Citizens’ Manifesto is that it will be crucial in curtailing these problems and helping voters understand the value of their votes. Let us now take a nosedive at two priority areas in the manifesto.

**Women's political representation**

Gender inequalities in political participation remain an important part of “democracy’s unresolved dilemma” of unequal participation. This is not a problem unique to Sierra Leone, although a few African countries like Malawi, Kenya, Liberia, have demonstrated commitment to providing space for women to occupy political leadership.

There is still a lot more to be done to increase women’s participation in politics. Beneath the rising sense of ethnic division, the 2016 World Peace Index ranked Sierra Leone the second most peaceful country in West Africa. But, is this really so? Should peace only be viewed as the absence of war or gunfire?

In a country where economic disparities between the rich and poor are ever rising, unemployment is the fate of university graduates and putting food on the table for mothers is an uphill struggle, it is important to practice a political culture characterised by wider participation, national development, non-violence, and women’s role is cardinal to achieving this.

This is why it requires that presidential candidates and political parties commit to giving 40 percent local council and parliamentary nominations to women. It says, “we believe that increased women’s representation in governance will help change the face of politics and improve the quality of representation in parliament and communities”.

Women make up over fifty percent of Sierra Leone’s population, but currently, occupy only eleven percent of the country’s parliamentary seats. This must change if peace is to last.

**Youth political representation**

“Young people should now think of voting on issues and not on tribal or regional basis or because politicians supply them drugs to wreak havoc and promise them better lives,” says Andrew Lavalie, Executive Director of Institute for Governance Reform, one of the leading civil society organizations behind the Citizens’ Manifesto.

He observed that young people have been consistently used by politicians and that it is time to change that narrative by giving young people the chance to assume leadership positions.

It is against this backdrop that the Citizens’ Manifesto is calling political parties and presidential candidates to give young people greater political access and participation. The manifesto demands at least 15% allocation of local council and parliamentary nominations to people under thirty-five. It says: “a large number of university graduates go jobless for years while many youths are mobilized for political violence.” This view is widely held by other Sierra Leoneans especially traders who sell cheap alcohol that politicians usually use as bait to lure young people into political rallies.

Amadu Kallon, a trader at Abacha Street, one of the busiest commercial business centres in Freetown, said: “Youths are being used by politicians. In the run-up to the primaries and constituency elections, I sold bundles of alcoholic contents worth millions of Leones to youth leaders for consumption at rallies organised by political aspirants. The Citizens’ Manifesto is, therefore, challenging politicians to take concrete actions that will “reclaim youths from violence and include them in leadership.”

In Sierra Leone where youth are vulnerable to manipulation and can be enticed into perpetrating violence during election campaigns, rising unemployment, lack of education and abject poverty exacerbates the problem. The stakes for conflicts, planned and pre-financed by ill-motivated politicians, are high as the country prepares for the decisive 2018 elections.

**Bottom-up hope, top-down commitment**

Political leaders made the commitment during the launch of the manifesto to work in line with the document, as well as agreeing they should adopt parts in their manifestos come March 2018.

Former Chairman and Leader of the SLPP, Chief Sumanoh Kapen, stated that the Manifesto targeted three key areas including social contract, social conscience and social engineering. He emphasised that the future and hope of Sierra Leone is in the youth and that the manifesto could not have come at a better time. Andrew Lavali of IGR noted that; “this document is the voice and aspirations of the ordinary Sierra Leonean, and the recommendations should be taken seriously because they have a role to play in advancing the country’s democracy.”

It is clear that one of the ongoing drivers of hate and violence is the reluctance of the political class to embrace the many opportunities for a sustainable solution to violence and political extremism. Impunity, inequality, and skewed resource distribution remain the biggest drivers of politics in Sierra Leone, reminiscent of the pre-war situation described in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report.

The Citizens’ Manifesto attempts to address these institutional challenges within the country’s political setup by presenting an opportunity for political parties to embrace reforms. The manifesto pushes for reforms that “disarm the tools for violent mobilisation as we count down to 2018.”

As the elections loom, ordinary people remain eager to see whether the Citizens’ Manifesto will be adopted and its recommendations taken seriously.

Over the 8 week period, from October 16 to December 10, the 5 most frequently reported diseases/syndromes were: unexplained fever (98 523 cases, 15.9%), acute respiratory infection (68 769 cases, 11.1%, with higher incidence rate among children less than 5 years old), acute watery diarrhoea (65 092 cases, 10.5%), and skin diseases (28 693 cases, 4.6%, with similar numbers of reported cases among both children aged under 5 and individuals aged 5 years and older).

Severe malnutrition was reported among 1518 patients, of which 88% were children aged under 5 years. 1860 patients presented with suspected measles or rubella, of which over 20% were among individuals aged five years and older. 

The frequency of respiratory infection, skin diseases and diarrhoea reflected in these reports is associated with poor living conditions with lack of essential hygiene and a high population density. The high number of patients presenting with injury, 6897, also needs to be investigated, as this may reflect poor living conditions that contribute to preventable morbidity.

“Other” conditions accounted for 318 661 cases (51.3% of all reported conditions), with 83% among people aged 5 years or older. Further investigation of this group will be conducted as a priority to assess the main causes of disease constituting this large category, in particular the incidence of non-communicable and/or chronic diseases that can lead to death if not treated (such as tuberculosis, diabetes and cardiac dysfunction), and psychiatric and psychological conditions that require specialized care.",4595,"Health"
2393504,"Diphtheria outbreak, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh - Daily epidemiological bulletin, 2017-12-26 _Epidemiological overview as of 25 Dec 2017_

_Time_

Between 8 Nov 2017 and 25 Dec 2017, 2440 suspected case-patients with diphtheria were reported in the settlements of forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals, Cox’s Bazar (Figure 1), 80 of which were reported on 25 Dec 2017 (Figure 2). Date of onset information is missing for 111 (4.5%) case-patients.

_Place_

Estimated attack rates (expressed as number of cases per 10,000 population) are shown in Figure 3. These estimates are based on population figures from 07 December 2017. N.B. due to difficulties in locating reported residence, only 1509 out of 2440 (61.8%) total casepatients have been included in the attack rate calculations, which therefore likely under-estimate the true attack rates. Efforts are ongoing to map these case-patients.

_Person_

**Age**

The age distribution of suspect case-patients shows that, approximately: one-quarter are among the 0-5 year age group, one-third are in the 5-10 year age group, and one-fifth are aged between 10-15 years (Figure 4). Importantly, 25.3% of the suspected case-patients are aged 15 years and older.

**Sex**

1090 (44.7%) of the case-patients are male, while 1337 (54.8%) of the case-patients are female (Figure 5). Information on sex was missing for 12 (0.5%) of case-patients. 

**Signs and symptoms prevalence**

There are 247 (10.1%) suspected case-patients without information on signs and symptoms. Of those suspected case-patients with this information, the prevalence of signs and symptoms is shown in Figure 6 (N.B. patients with no information are excluded from this analysis): 

**Outcomes**

There are 26 deaths recorded in the linelist thus far.

**Delay distributions**

The median [IQR] delay from symptom onset to presentation at health facilities was 2 [2 - 3] days. Among those who have died, the median [IQR] delay from symptom onset to death was 7 [4.25 - 10] days.

**Contacts**

Contact tracing and follow-up for chemo-prophylaxis is an important component of the outbreak response strategy. Close contacts are defined as “those sleeping in the same shelter or who have been directly exposed to nasopharyngeal secretions of the patient on a prolonged or regular basis (example, school classmates other patients in wards and medical staff)”.

There is no information on number of close contacts for 518 (21.2%) suspected case-patients. 

Among those case-patients for whom information is available on number of close contacts, the median [IQR] number of contacts is 5 [3 - 7], while the total range is 0-21 (Figure 7).",4595,"Health"

“2017 was a horrible year for the children of Yemen,” UNICEF Representative in the country, Meritxell Relaño, told UN News by telephone from the capital, Sana’a.

More than 80 children were killed or injured in December alone, while millions face a cholera epidemic, looming famine, a disruption in health services and a blockade hampering delivery of much-needed supplies.

She urged a political solution for what she said was a man-made conflict and warned that without a political solution many more children would die.

Ms. Relaño recounted meeting a woman and her dying 7-year-old son Ali in a hospital in Aden.

“He was like skin on bones. I asked why they had not come sooner and the mother told me that she could not afford to ride the bus to the hospital. The levels of poverty in the families [have] now reached levels that are unsustainable,” she said.

To offset some of this type of need, Ms. Relaño noted that some 1.3 million families, or about 8 million people, are being reached with emergency cash as part of a transfer project between UNICEF and the World Bank.

She also praised successful efforts to deliver vaccines and implement a polio immunization campaign this year to benefit some 5 million children and provide treatment for 200,000 children with acute malnutrition.

“Yemenis who work on the ground to support the Yemenis are the true heroes,” she said, noting the efforts of local authorities, doctors, nurses and teachers in the country.

Duque III today immediately ordered the augmentation of medicines and other medical supplies in regions hit by tropical storm “Vinta” in Mindanao to respond to the immediate health needs of thousands of affected families and communities. 

""The DOH expresses its sympathy to our countrymen on this tragic event especially with the loss of lives and with many still reported missing along with their homes which were destroyed by flash floods and landslides. This is very sad especially at this time when families should be celebrating Christmas and preparing for the festivities of the New Year,"" Duque lamented. The health chief also appealed to the public any assistance they can provide to those affected by the disaster.

Secretary Duque also reported that flash floods and landslide incidents occurred in Zamboanga del Norte, while the municipality of Carmen, Daval del Norte has now been declared under state of calamity. 

A total of 70,454 families or 320,180 individuals are affected in 569 barangays in MIMAROPA, Central Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Central Mindanao, Davao region, ARMM and CARAGA. 

At the moment, the Department of Health is still on alert and concerned regional offices are instructed to deploy emergency response teams to provide the needed health services to the affected population, and ordered continuous coordination with their respective Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils. 

Also, the DOH Davao regional office has emergency medical teams to Talomo North District, Marilog District, Bunangin District and District A to provide health consultations and treatments. DOH Central Visayas provided technical services on water sanitation, hygiene and nutrition services. 

The DOH Central Mindanao augmented assorted medicines to rural health units of Pantao Ragat and Balo-1 for internally-displaced people inside and outside of evacuation centers, started leptospirosis prophylaxis to exposed individuals, augmented doxycycline in Northern Mindanao Medical Center and provided health teachings on the proper use of water treatment solutions.

2393439,"Venezuela Situation Update, November 2017 The total number of Venezuelans in Colombia has more than doubled in less than four months, reaching 660,000 individuals, end-November, up from 300,000 in June.

Between January and October 2017 over 100.000 Venezuelan nationals have entered Peru through the northern entry point in Tumbes, according to authorities.

In Brazil 15,645 Venezuelans have lodged asylum claims in 2017, 1,680 Temporary Residence Permits have been granted and a total of 30,000 are estimated to live in the country.

**POPULATION OF CONCERN** 

- In November the movements from Venezuela to Colombia continued to grow, according to government figures that show net arrivals from Venezuelans reached 4,000 people per day (up from 3,500 in October), and 2,500 Colombian returnees per day. Colombian authorities also reported that some 200,000 have crossed into Ecuador. 

- Over 1 million Venezuelans have now registered for the Border Mobility Card (TMF) in Colombia. 

- In Peru 19,000 Venezuelans have applied for the Temporary Permanence Permit (PTP), Peruvian authorities estimate. Since August 4,000 PTPs have been issued out of that total. 

- At least 60,000 Venezuelans are estimated to be residing in the Southern Caribbean. 

- In Brazil some 15,000 of all Venezuelan asylum-claims have been lodged in Roraima border state since 2014, 2,500 in Amazonas state and some 590 in Sao Paulo.

**CONTEXT INFORMATION**

Over one million Venezuelans have left their country, according to host Government figures. Over 106,000 have sought asylum since 2014, more than half in 2017. Some 190,000 have also applied for alternative legal status across the region. They claim they are leaving for a variety of reasons, including threats by armed groups; fear of being targeted on account of their political opinion, real or perceived; insecurity and violence; lack of food, medicine and access to essential social services, as well as loss of income.

UNHCR has also identified hundreds of indigenous people crossing the borders, primarily into Colombia and Brazil. These groups sometimes travel long distances by land and have shown to be highly vulnerable as they do not have the financial resources to buy food or shelter. Additional support has been provided to them.

While the dialogue between the Government and the opposition coalition has restarted in the Dominican Republic, people continue to steadily leave the country. The socio-economic situation increasingly deteriorates and inflation has made it extremely difficult to access food, medicine, basic products and services. Reports from international organizations state that there is a considerable number of people with chronic malnutrition in the country, as well as a shortage of medicine. As a result of the strained resources, insecurity has also been increasing and having a rising impact on peoples’ lives.

**Operational Context**

**Brazil**

- The Government of Roraima has declared a state of social emergency due to the “intense, unlimited and disorderly flow of Venezuelans without means or conditions to sustain themselves” that arrive from Venezuela. Local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to provide an adequate security and health response, as well as to implement the recent government resolution that establishes standard operation procedures for the protection of unaccompanied and separated children, based on the recommendations by UNHCR.

- Among the reasons given by the Warao for leaving Venezuela, is that the government’s support to indigenous communities in the country has ceased. They claim that there are no available schools, health centres or services. Water distribution, usually their only source of potable water, has allegedly also stopped. The Warao also stated that they suffered discrimination in the access to ID- documents, which could help explain the considerable amount of Warao without identification arriving in Brazil.

- The Warao continue to move inward, confirming their intent to stay. Over 200 Warao are living in Pará state. The majority is living on the streets, while some 70 people are staying in a rural school set up as a temporary shelter by the Municipality. Following UNHCR’s counsel, Amazonas and Pará authorities created a formal communication channel to exchange experiences and lessons learned.

**Colombia**

- Armed groups activities at the Colombian-Venezuela border, incursions by the Venezuelan military into Colombia, confrontations between governments and the lack of capacity to control the actions of armed actors on both sides of the border are increasing risks for persons of concern in these areas. UNHCR continues to monitor the reports of violence at the border.

- In October, a pamphlet was distributed in Arauca by the “Araucan Social Cleansing Group”, accusing Venezuelan men of selling drugs to children and committing crimes and Venezuelan women of being prostitutes, and called for them to go back to Venezuela or face assassination.

- Colombian authorities are concerned about the spread of diseases including malaria, measles, diphtheria and tuberculosis in reception areas. They state that due to a lack of health access in Venezuela, arrivals are boosting transmission rates. More than 19,000 Venezuelans have received emergency treatment in Colombia, increasing pressure on local services. The Government is working with the Red Cross and WHO/PAHO to increase services, and UNHCR is advocating to ensure a protection-sensitive approach.

- The Special Stay Permit (PEP) application deadline expired on 31 October. Over 67,000 Venezuelans applied for the permit, which allows them to regularize their status, work and access basic services for up to two years in Colombia. UNHCR is advocating for this measure to be extended to ensure that legal pathways remain open, as is the case in other countries in the region.",4595,"Health"

2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",4595,"Health"
2393194,"Solar power brings light to Congolese refugees in Angola **LOUVA, Angola** – Since the outbreak of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kasai region earlier this year, nearly 35,000 refugees have poured into Angola’s Lunda Norte Province.

The population is highly vulnerable. Some 75 per cent of refugees from Kasai are women and children, according to UN reports. Many refugees have reported witnessing mass killings, rape and other human rights abuses during their flight from conflict.

Ester, 25, recounted the frenzy of her departure. “It was the day when the war arrived to our village. They were killing people. I was not able to take anything with me, only my children,” she said.

Humanitarian groups are working to relocate many of the refugees from the Cacanda reception centre to a new settlement in Lóvua.

The new location allows the refugees to have some privacy and space for farming, but it is not connected to an electrical grid, so the refugees are left in total darkness when the sun sets – a problem for their safety and security.

Ester’s family recently moved into the settlement. “We are living in the bush. I do not have any lamps, and no light. It makes me feel afraid,” she said. “There is, for example, no light for us to be able to go to the toilet during night.” 

**Darkness poses risks**

Around the world, women and girls report being threatened or assaulted when leaving home at night to relieve themselves or manage their menstrual hygiene. These risks are elevated in crisis settings, when social safety nets, law enforcement and other protection mechanisms break down.

Darkness poses other risks as well. Women who go into labour at night, for example, may have trouble getting to clinics or being properly treated without a reliable light source.

“Light is important to help maintain the safety and rights of women and adolescents at night,” said Florbela Fernandes, UNFPA’s representative in Angola.

**Portable sunshine**

UNFPA is working with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to provide 50 solar-powered units to community centres, medical facilities and other communal spaces in the Lóvua refugee settlement. 

The units, donated by Panasonic, consist of a solar panel, three LED lamps, and a rechargeable battery that can also be used to charge mobile phones.

“We hope these solar lamps can be installed in public facilities to be able to extend the services and provide light in the dark,” said Yuzo Kitamoto, deputy representative for the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Angola, after a visit to Lóvua in December.

Women and girls arriving in Lóvua are also receiving solar-powered torches, part of the dignity kits that are a standard part of UNFPA’s humanitarian response. Some 2,000 dignity kits – which contain hygiene items such as soap, underwear and sanitary napkins – are being handed out, with more on the way. 

UNFPA is additionally partnering with the UN Refugee Agency to deliver solar street lights to the settlement. And in partnership with Médicos del Mundo, UNFPA has set up women-friendly spaces, where women and girls can rest, socialize, and learn where to receive reproductive health services and help for survivors of gender-based violence.

As for Ester, she is determined to move forward. “I hope for a good life with my family here in Angola,” she said. “I am too afraid to return now.”

2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4595,"Health"

They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent.

River in the region, affecting the city located in the downstream area.

AMDA team comprising one nurse and two coordinators had already been working in the Philippines
for the earlier typhoon disaster on the island of Biliran. Now that the extent of the damage brought
about by the newly emerged typhoon is dire, the team will be heading to Cagayan de Oro accordingly.
In the evening of the 25th, the team had a briefing with our local partner, to discuss further relief
effort.

According to DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) of the Philippines, the affected
population across 998 districts is 541,005 people (115,568 households) with which 182,377 people
(37,424 households) have fled homes to seek shelter on higher grounds (as of 25 December).",4595,"Health"
2392439,"Afghanistan Weekly Field Report | 19 - 24 December 2017 **Countrywide Conflict Displacement**

2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",4595,"Health"
2392184,"Severe malnutrition tops 11% in Bangladesh refugee camps - World Vision study 21 December 2017 (Cox's Bazar) – A recent nutrition screening of 1,862 children in Balukhali, Jamtoli and Thangkhali refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh found 199 (11 per cent) children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), according to child-focused World Vision, which conducted the seven-week assessment ending mid-December. 

“This data is alarmingly high. Although the sample size is only a fraction of all the children under five in the camps, even one child with SAM puts us one step closer to a higher mortality rate,” said Fred Witteveen, national director of World Vision Bangladesh. Severe acute malnutrition, the most visible and extreme form of undernutrition, is one of the world’s leading causes of death among children under five. 

Based on joint aid agency data from Cox’s Bazar in mid-December, of more than 35,000 children diagnosed with SAM, 18,083 have been admitted to therapeutic feeding centers for treatment, while close to 17,000 children are still in need of treatment. A recent multi-agency emergency nutrition assessment showed the prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) among all children 6-59 months of age at 24 per cent. The World Health Organization threshold for declaring a nutrition emergency is 15 per cent.

**Contributing causes** 

Poor access to clean water and improved sanitation can hurt a child’s nutritional status through diarrhoeal diseases and intestinal infections. 

According to a 3 December report in Cox’s Bazar, more than half a million people do not have adequate access to clean water and sanitation in and around the camps. Donors have funded only 23 percent of what is needed to provide 1.2 million people with sufficient water and basic sanitation. The continued arrival of refugees has further stretched already scarce facilities. Of the more than 5,300 tube wells installed, only 70 per cent work properly, while a little over one-third of the 35,650 temporary latrines are already not working. 

“Precarious access to and lack of these basic facilities in the camps can prove fatal, especially for children and others with weakened immunity,” shared Witteveen. “Most arrived in poor nutritional condition. We are racing to avoid the fatal tipping point many face.” 

To date, World Vision in partnership with UNICEF, has distributed hygiene kits and jerry cans to 14,500 people while hygiene promotion that targets at least 30,000 individuals has begun. Construction of 1,200 latrines, 600 gender sensitive bathing cubicles and 55 deep tube wells is also on-going, in close coordination with experts to ensure all facilities meet emergency response standards. World Vision has established four women and young child spaces to educate pregnant women and lactating mothers on child survival. 

Fighting that broke out almost four months ago in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State has forced out some 655,000 people to date into Bangladesh, almost all who identify as Rohingya. The population of the largest camp in Cox’s Bazar, known locally as Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, has multiplied more than five times since late August, now topping 547,000 people.

**2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview**

On 29 November, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Somalia released the 2018
Humanitarian Needs Overview. The Humanitarian Needs Overview predicts that in 2018, over 6.2
million people, half of the population of Somalia, will need humanitarian assistance and protection due
to the ongoing drought and conflict. Over two million IDPs are among those who are in urgent need of
assistance.1 Several reports by the monitoring agencies indicated that in a scenario of continued
assistance at current levels, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible. Large-scale assistance is
needed through 2018 to prevent the loss of lives and collapse of livelihoods.

**16 Days of Activism against Sexual and Gender-based Violence**

On 25 November, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women,
UNHCR across the country launched the 16 days of activism against Sexual and Gender-based
Violence (SGBV) campaign. In the 16 days several activities were carried out by UNHCR and partners
with the theme “Leave no one behind – working together to end sexual and gender-based violence”.

**Floods affected people of concern and destroyed their shelters**

UNHCR field units (FU) in Dhobley and Baidoa reported that Deyr rain has affected IDPs in
various IDP settlements. The issues identified were collapsed latrines which pose health risks
(waterborne diseases) and destroyed shelters. Affected people are in need of hygiene kits, shelters,
awareness on best hygienic practices and improving the drainage system. UNHCR has assisted 9,866
people affected by rains: 7,266 persons benefited from kits, which consist of core relief items (CRIs),
1,400 benefited from hygiene kits and 1,200 benefited from awareness raising session on hygiene. In
Dhobley FU also advocated for alternative land for relocation of IDPs.",4595,"Health"
2392134,"Philippines: IFRC warns of worsening conditions following deadly Tropical Storm Tembin Manila/Kuala Lumpur 26 December —Four days after tropical storm Tembin made landfall in Mindanao, thousands of survivors are still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.

“Our teams in Mindanao are doing all they can to reach everyone who needs them. But the work is difficult and often slow,” says Philippine Red Cross Chairman Gordon. “Around the world, people are spending this time period with their families. For people affected by Tembin, what should be a peaceful time is instead full of uncertainty and fear. We need to help them.”

As responders reach the worst affected areas, details of the havoc wrought by Tembin (known locally as “Vinta”) continue to emerge. More than 500,000 people in 23 provinces have been affected. The national disaster risk reduction and management council (NDRRMC) confirms that 164 people have lost their lives to the flashfloods and landslides, with 176 are still missing. The number of casualties is expected to increase as the public authorities verify information being received from the provinces.

In addition to causing the loss of human lives and internal displacement, Tembin has substantially impacted shelter and livelihoods and caused damage to crops and critical infrastructure including roads, bridges and power transmission lines.

Volunteers and search and rescue teams from the Philippine Red Cross have been active since the hours before the storm made landfall, and are now working to reach people in need with water, food, and emergency shelter. Hot meals are being served, and welfare services provided in the evacuation centers, where over 50,000 people are staying after being evacuated prior to the landfall of the storm.

To support these efforts, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is joining the Philippine Red Cross in [appealing](https://reliefweb.int/node/2392084) for 2.8 million Swiss francs to assist more than 20,000 people affected by the storm in four of the worst affected provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro.

“People have gone through a massive shock. In just minutes, they lost everything, and then had to fight for their lives as walls of mud and water washed through their homes,” says Patrick Elliott, IFRC Operations and Programmes Manager in the Philippines.

“Now we must ensure that affected communities have immediate access to essential items and services including cash, food, water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, as well to information, psychosocial support, and protection.”

The World Health Organization (WHO) in Swaziland is pleased to share with its partners and stakeholders its 2014-2015 Biennial Report. This report covers the contribution WHO made towards addressing some of the health challenges and disease burden in the country. Over the two year the health sector made a lot of progress towards improving the health status of the people of Swaziland.  
We applaud the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland for prioritising the health sector in national budget allocation. The Government provides full funding for procurement of essential medicines like antiretroviral drugs and vaccines. We also congratulate the government for developing the second Health Sector Strategic Plan which puts Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as its central theme. The country also successfully hosted the third National Health Research Conference in 2014 and developed a national research agenda for health.  
There have been several achievements during the biennium. The year 2014 saw the government introducing the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13), a cost effective child survival intervention that contributes towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets. In 2015 the Rota Virus vaccine was added to the national routine immunisation schedule. The assent to the Tobacco Products Control Act of 2013 was followed by the development of the National Tobacco Control policy and regulations to the Act in 2014. Significant progress was made towards improving the health of mothers and children in line with attaining MDG 4 and 5. The country also completed the Stepwise approach to disease surveillance (STEPs survey) which provides essential evidence for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Swaziland also successfully conducted the mapping survey for Soil transmitted Helminthiasis and schistosomiasis with support from WHO.  
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Government of Swaziland, development partners, local non-governmental organizations and members of the communities for their support during the biennium. WHO Swaziland Country Office is committed to playing its leadership role in matters concerning health, providing technical support, building capacity of the health sector to deal with the health problems facing the country.",4595,"Health"

2392074,"The magic of results-based financing In 2018, the Zimbabwean government will fully take over the World Bank financed and Cordaid implemented health program in Zimbabwe. “We helped to revitalize the national health system”, says Arjanne Rietsema, Cordaid’s Country director in Zimbabwe. “Safely handing over the results-based financing program, will be one of our biggest achievements.”

This results-based financing (RBF) program mainly focuses on maternal and neonatal health care in 18 districts. Cordaid, acting as central purchasing agency, contracts 400 facilities (366 health centers and 34 hospitals) to provide a defined set of services. In total they serve a population of over 3 million people.

**Sustained improvement of access to health care**

“The government has allocated 10.2 million USD for the results-based financing program. This is great news. Our results will be consolidated”, says Arjanne Rietsema. The recent 2018 budget statement of the Zimbabwean government couldn’t have come at a better moment. As of January, Cordaid stops purchasing health services.

In the words of the new Zimbabwean government: “The recent turnaround in the improvement of key maternal, neonatal and child health indicators is largely on account of the implementation of innovative financing mechanisms such as results-based financing. This has led to a sustained improvement in the availability, accessibility, and utilisation of quality health care services. To sustain and consolidate these gains, the 2018 Budget proposes to allocate US$10.2 million.”

**Infusing health facilities with an entrepreneurial spirit**

“For years the Mugabe led government kept on reducing the health budget”, Rietsema explains. “It now seems that the new government is reversing the tide. They are serious in taking over the implementation of the RBF health program. This shows the success of Cordaid’s results-based financing approach. In five years’ time we managed to infuse hundreds of health facilities with an entrepreneurial spirit. This has drastically improved access to health care for the poorest, especially young mothers and children.”

*Zimbabwe health program at a glance:*

18 districts

400 health facilities (including 34 hospitals)

giving 3.2 million people access to health care

allowing 100.000 pregnant women to deliver safely

providing pregnancy check-ups to more than 125.000 women

**Restarting after total collapse**

To fully gauge the achievements of the RBF program, we need to go back to 2008. Mugabe’s economic adjustment program and his land reforms had devastated the economy. Public services, including the health system, collapsed. Salaries evaporated as a result of hyperinflation – at one point the state printed 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar notes. Food production and life expectancy dropped and people fled the country by the millions.

**Immediate results of results-based financing**

Jos Dusseljee, Cordaid’s senior health expert who kickstarted the program back in 2011: “It’s on these vestiges we started the RBF program in 2011, after having won a World Bank tender. We knew the basic health infrastructure was intact, and the human capacity was basically there. But most health facilities were derelict. Salaries were very low, leading to absenteeism. Consequently the facilities were unable to provide a full package of primary health services, let alone adhere to quality standards. Our guess was that with little push – a relatively small financial investment of 2 USD per capita, and a strictly results-based financing method – we could achieve a steep increase in the quantity and quality of health services. This proved true. We saw the magic of RBF happening before our eyes.”

Cordaid purchased entire district maternal and child health services. Initially we did this in 2 front runner districts. Soon we expanded to 16 others. Dusseljee: “We pay – or do not pay – contracted facilities according to their verified scores on a pre-agreed set of indicators. There are quantity output indicators, such as the number of deliveries, child vaccinations, ante- and postnatal care. And quality indicators, such as the quality of the premises, of management and of service delivery, besides patient satisfaction.”

**Monitoring 20 indicators in 400 facilities**

Cordaid put in place a thorough monitoring and evaluation system to check monthly achievements. This involved district health officers as well as Community Based Organisations who traced patients and measured their satisfaction with the services they received. Dusseljee: “You can imagine that monitoring 20 indicators in 400 facilities spread all over the country was quite an operation. To manage, we set up small Cordaid outposts in different provinces.”

The impact was impressive. “I have been involved in health system strengthening for many years and many different countries”, says Dusseljee. “And I can say that the first results in Zimbabwe were astonishing. Utilisation of services increased significantly. So much so that the Ministry of Health wanted us to scale up fast after they saw the results in the front runner districts.”

**Happy with the money, not with the conditions**

By this time, the Ministry of Health’s initial hesitance to collaborate with Cordaid had vanished. From the start the World Bank had insisted to work with a private implementing and purchasing agency, rather than with the government. Rietsema: “When Cordaid started, the government was happy with the money invested in Zimbabwean public health. But they weren’t happy with the conditions and the fact that not themselves, but Cordaid was the main implementer and purchasing agency.”

Once Cordaid started to roll out the program, health centers got back on track after years of gradual collapse. And government’s attitude changed overnight. “Soon government delegations came over to visit us”, Rietsema recalls. “And in their wake came delegations of other countries who wanted to learn from us.”

After 2,5 years the RBF approach implemented by Cordaid, was integrated in national health policies.

**Long awaited make-over**

On average and on a quarterly basis, Cordaid buys services worth 1000 USD per health center and 30.000 USD per hospital. Rietsema: “Theoretically our RBF payments are meant for innovation and as an incentive to perform better. They don’t cover the regular bills. State subsidies should do that. But these were lacking. That’s why RBF World Bank money – the main source of income for most facilities – was invested in the make-over they had been waiting for for years: building waiting rooms for pregnant mothers, installing solar panels, connecting facilities to the grid, giving walls a fresh coat of paint and other basic infrastructural improvements. Making the premises much more attractive and welcoming. The next step was the improvement of services, procurement of medicines, of diagnostic equipment.”

**Early booking for antenatal services**

The RBF change – or ‘the magic’ as Dusseljee calls it – is more than just the improvement of infrastructural and services. Rietsema: “Health staff had been used to things being supplied – and more often not supplied – either by donor agencies or the state. They weren’t used to the freedom and the responsibility to manage their own budget. RBF gave them just this. It pushed them to manage their own health centers and hospitals. Staff felt the need to develop strategies to attract patients. Patients who had lost their faith in public health services a long time ago. RBF pushed health staff to become more entrepreneurial. For example, some nurses have become very creative in promoting ‘early booking’ for antenatal services. Which is great as pregnant women often seek medical assistance far too late in their pregnancy. Women who book their antenatal care services early, receive soap and groceries. These are very welcome items for most households! They might cost something, but the financial benefits coming with the increase in patients far outweigh the costs.”

One thing that astonished Dusseljee – apart from the quick results – is how fast the Zimbabwean government embraced the RBF policy and nationalized it. “This and the fact that other countries took over our method as well. It confirmed our capacity to design and successfully implement innovative health financing approaches. And it strengthened our relationship with the World Bank.”

**Future of the program**

There’s one wish Rietsema still has for the next phase of the program. “I hope there will still be a technical unit that focuses on innovation and system improvement in RBF. We have started working with tablets and smartphones. But we need to do more to promote electronic invoicing and the use of tablets and applications in monitoring, to name just a few technical innovations. In addition to that: quality improvement is something we have only just started emphasising strongly. This needs to be continued.”

Dusseljee, from his side, comes with another piece of advice: “The program is built on supply-side incentives. This worked well, but statistics show that after the spectacular initial results, service use is now levelling. In order to make sure we reach everyone and come one step closer to Universal Health Coverage, there should be provisions for demand-side incentives too. For example, the government could contract and reward communities for their efforts to help the most needy in accessing health care services.”

**Handing over to the government**

Cordaid’s technical role in the RBF program will continue until mid-2018, but as of January the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Care will replace Cordaid as the purchasing agency. Rietsema: “This is why it’s so important they have allocated more than 10 million USD. The next step is that the government implements the budget and continues the program. Which would be a great relief. Cordaid is already in the process of handing over. The Ministry of Health already accommodates our technical staff.”

“At the start, we worked against the odds. Now, we can hand over a well-functioning program to a government that shows real health care commitment and is ready to further expand the RBF scheme”, Rietsema concludes. “That, to me, is very satisfying.”",4595,"Health"

**Community’s resistance**

Sometimes local mosques show resistance towards the child friendly space activities. Thus, influential members of the community itself, such as religious leaders (imams), need to be engaged in productive discussion to increase understanding of the necessity of these activities. Active community membership and productive engagement in child protection committees can also play a significant role in opening the mindsets of the people.

**Access to market**

Rice is availed as a relief item; however, other food items (protein or vegetables) need to acquired to ensure a balanced diet. Although many FDMNs have cash, they are unable to purchase these additional items as the markets places are far from settlement and are hard to access. Another problem is that women do not have a way to earn money, as their skills may be limited to what they can produce (e.g. sew clothes and sell) and also being unable to utilise the local markets.",4595,"Health"

- Quality healthcare and public health campaigns have helped improve the health of residents in a district in Khost Province.

- Health services and campaigns are being delivered under the System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition Program implemented by the Ministry of Public Health.

- Specifically, the program aims to reduce maternal and child mortality through better midwifery services.

**TANAI DISTRICT, Khost Province** – A short clip about vaccinations is playing on the TV of the waiting hall. All eyes are locked on the screen. A young girl talks about the importance of vaccination in early childhood. She directly encourages people to bring their children to the nearest health center for vaccination.

Alif Khan, 60, is sitting in the tiny waiting hall of the Dargai Comprehensive Health Center (CHC) for a routine vaccination visit. Next to him is his grandson, 4, whom Alif Khan has brought for a vaccination. They are not alone in the hall, a group of more than 20 people are also there, watching the health awareness clips and making small talk.

Alif Khan lives in Potkai Lalmi village in Tanai district, Khost Province, in southeast Afghanistan. Eight years ago, people of the district were very conservative when it came to health matters. Alif Khan remembers the time when his brother died of appendicitis because they didn’t take him to a health center. “In the past, when a person had an illness in the village, people thought it was infectious and denied treating them normally,” he says. “It was hard, especially for those who had tuberculosis, because people used to believe that it did not have a cure.”

Today, residents in Tanai district are more informed about health matters. Dargai CHC holds public health awareness campaigns regularly, carried out by 24 Community Health Workers (CHW). In addition to the campaigns, doctors in the health center engage in public awareness. The TV in the waiting hall is another source of information. “We are very lucky that our doctors have a good understanding of our culture and traditions. They understand us well and deliver the services efficiently,” remarks Alif Khan as he prepares to take his grandson into the vaccination department.

Dargai CHC is one of 30 health centers in Khost Province that deliver a Basic Package of Health Services under the [System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition](http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P129663/afghanistan-system-enhancement-health-action-transition-project?lang=en) (SEHAT) Program, implemented by the [Ministry of Public Health](http://www.moph.gov.af/) (MoPH).

The clinic was established more than 20 years ago, as a small health center. Today, it has upgraded to a CHC with 21 employees, including doctors, midwives, nurses, and other support staff, serve 25,000 people in Tanai district. It receives 150 patients per day on average. “People walk long distances to reach the health center, because they trust us now” says Dr. Pacha Khan, 50, who has worked in the center for more than 20 years. “Their well-being is improving day by day.”

SEHAT aims to expand the scope, quality, and coverage of health services provided to the population, particularly for the poor. It is supported by the [International Development Association](http://www.worldbank.org/ida) (IDA), the World Bank Group’s fund for the poorest countries, and the [Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund](http://www.artf.af/) (ARTF), in partnership with multiple donors.

Health services at the CHC is provided by the Organization for Health Promotion and Management (OHPM), a nongovernmental organization (NGO), which has been contracted by MoPH. The contract is one of several performance-based partnership agreements between MoPH and NGOs to deliver defined packages of basic health services and essential hospital services under the SEHAT Program.

**Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality**

OHPM started implementing the SEHAT Program in Khost Province in July 2015 and will continue until June 2018. SEHAT covers more than 565,000 people in the province. It works to deliver all types of health services, focusing on reducing maternal and child mortality across the province.

Toward this end, the midwifery service has been strengthened in the province. According to MoPH regulation, each CHC should have two midwives, but in Khost OHPM has hired four midwives in each of the five CHCs. “We have good coordination in the SEHAT Program internally and with other organizations, especially with a French NGO, Doctors without Borders (MSF),” says Dr. Abdul Wali, SEHAT Project Manager in Khost Province. “Through this coordination, we have hired 20 more midwives in our five CHCs.”

This initiative has improved delivery of health services for mothers and children as well as raised awareness of the services. Midwife Nooriya Rahmani, who has worked in Dargai CHC for more than five years, affirms that “a few years ago, women used not to come to the health center as their knowledge about health services was very low.” But now, she says, people come seeking the services. “It shows that awareness has been raised among people in the district.”

The gynecology department of Dargai CHC receives an average of 50 patients per day and carries out three to four deliveries per 24 hours. The midwives also give health education to the women who come to the center, which has helped them to know about different illnesses. “Now there is not a single woman in our village who hasn’t come to the health center and we are really happy with the services at the Dargai Health Center,” says Almarah, 40, a resident of Tanai district. ",4595,"Health"

The Emergency Appeal is currently being revised and these changes will be reflected. The revised Emergency Appeal will be focused in carrying out roof repairs in coordination with the local authorities.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

**A.2 Summary of current response**

**Overview of Host National Society**

4,225 volunteers are activated, of which 2,533 are from the operations and relief groups carrying out recovery work in the affected regions in sanitation and epidemic control including 531 volunteers working in the protection centres. The Restoring Family Link (RFL) office is working with 168 volunteers at the municipal level, in the 15 provinces and the central headquarters) with 1,161 volunteers

**Overview of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement in the country**

The IFRC continues providing support and coordination with the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) through its Country Cluster Support Team based in Dominican Republic, and through the Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) based in Panama. The Country Cluster Support Team and the regional disaster management coordinator (also emergency shelter focal point) are giving the support to all the response actions of this operation. The sectors and needs addressed by this Emergency Appeal were identified by the CRC in coordination with the government.

The Spanish Red Cross, who has had presence in the country, deployed one staff member to support the National Society’s response efforts. In addition, on the onset of the emergency and on 9 October, two staff members from the Canadian Red Cross Society were deployed to Cuba with the aim to contribute to the response requirements of the Cuban Red Cross.

The Cuban Red Cross coordinated bilaterally with the Spanish Red Cross, through its permanent cooperation program, a shipment of new clothes and footwear for adults, and psycho-pedagogical centres including children without subsidiary protection.

**Movement Coordination**

The Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) has been sharing official information from the CRC with all Movement members. The CRC led coordination meetings at country level with the Spanish Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Society.

  PRC Chairman and CEO Richard Gordon said staff and volunteers from the 31 chapters in Mindanao and its National Headquarters are currently responding and closely monitoring the situation as Tropical Storm Vinta traverses the country. 

  “When the world no longer watches, the Philippine Red Cross stays to do what must be done. We are one in helping the most vulnerable, banking on our fundamental principle of humanity,” Gordon said.

   He added that the PRC also mobilized 82 staff and 1,955 volunteers from its 24 chapters in the Visayas to help those affected by Tropical Storm Urduja, which made a total of six landfalls on December 16.

  “I would like to commend the families of our staff and volunteers who continuously share their loved ones withus so they can be of service to humanity. This is the true spirit of the holiday season,” he added.

  PRC volunteers were also first to respond when a ceiling of the Butuan City Jail collapsed during the height of Vinta last Friday. 

  Prepositioned non-food items from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for 1,000 families are also ready for distribution at the Philippine Red Cross Chapter in Cagayan de Oro.

‘Urduja’ Response

  Philippine Red Cross teams were among the first on the ground to assess and monitor the situation in the aftermath of Urduja. 

  So far, the Red Cross was able to provide rescue, welfare assistance, first aid management, hot meals, psychosocial support, and relief goods in Urduja-affected communities.

  Some 240 families received sleeping kits, which include blankets, towels, and plastic mats. Food items were also distributed to 651 affected families. Some 8,185individuals were provided with hot meals and 169 people were given psychosocial support.

  It can be recalled that the PRC was among the first to access Biliran province, one of the hardest hit areas by Urduja. The PRC set up a 5,000-liter water bladder at the Biliran Provincial Hospital to provide water regularly to patients and nearby residents, and provided anti-tetanus vaccines to injured individuals. 

   The Philippine Red Cross, as the foremost humanitarian organization in the country, has 103 chapters with two million volunteers nationwide that is always first, always ready and always there to provide round-the-clock humanitarian assistance, especially to the most vulnerable.

   Aside from disaster responses, PRC’s other services include health, welfare, safety, blood, volunteer service, and Red Cross youth.",4595,"Health"

 PRC Secretary General Atty. Oscar Palabyab personally received the donation from Chinese Embassy to the Philippines Counsellor Sun Yi at the PRC National Headquarters in Mandaluyong City on Wednesday. 

 “We are very thankful to the Chinese people for your generosity to the Filipinos. Be rest assured that this amount will be properly accounted for and will go far in providing the urgent needs of those suffering from the recent devastating storm in the Visayas,” Palabyab said. 

 A statement released by the Chinese Embassy website said that the “Chinese side looks forward to the aid lending more strength to the disaster relief efforts on the Philippine side to overcome the difficulties caused by tropical storm Urduja, which has hit the Visayas of the Philippines recently, and help the affected people restore their normal livelihood at an earliest date.” 

 Aside from Palabyab, also present to witness the turnover of the donation are: PRC Assistant Secretary General Elizabeth Zavalla, Chinese Embassy to the Philippines Third Secretary of Political Office Liu Tiantian, PRC Fund Generation Director Genna Mijares, and PRC Communications Manager April Ann Abello-Bulanadi. 

 Since last week, the PRC has been working round-the-clock amidst the Christmas season to provide the needed humanitarian assistance to areas affected by Urduja. 

 The PRC recently deployed a humanitarian caravan, consisting of ambulances, water tanker, water bladders, tap stands, water treatment sets and portable generator sets to Biliran province.

 To address the scarcity of clean water in the area, the PRC set up a 5,000-liter water bladder at the Biliran Provincial Hospital. It also provided anti-tetanus vaccines, as well as food and non-food items such as towels, plastic mats and blankets in Biliran. 

 The PRC also set up 13 welfare desks and provided psychosocial support to 169 individuals. Over 60 individuals were also rescued and transported for medical attention.

 The PRC also distributed hot meals to 8,299 individuals in Northern Samar, Ormoc City, Surigao City, Leyte, Masbate, Eastern Samar, and Camarines Norte.

2391604,"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock – Statement on Yemen, 24 December 2017 I remain deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Yemen, where more than 22 million people need humanitarian assistance – 8.4 million of whom are already on the edge of starvation. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have continued and must stop. I am encouraged, however, by the news that the first commercial fuel imports into Hudaydah port since 6 November docked today, while commercial food imports that resumed in recent weeks have continued. 

Yemen imports approximately 90 per cent of its food and nearly all its fuel and medicine. The steady flow of these imports is a lifeline for millions of civilians. Commercial food imports are needed to keep food available and affordable in markets across the country. Fuel imports are essential to run generators in hospitals and health facilities, as well as to power water networks and sanitation systems, among other essential activities. Millions of people depend on these critical services. Hudaydah port is the closest port to the majority of Yemenis. 

As Yemen continues to grapple with widespread hunger, malnutrition, internal displacement, the world’s largest cholera outbreak, an alarming diphtheria outbreak and other challenges, it is essential that we work together to keep commercial food, medicine and fuel imports flowing into all ports. We must also ensure that life-saving humanitarian assistance is able to enter all ports swiftly and quickly reaches the millions of people who need it. Humanitarian aid is often shipped on commercial vessels, further underscoring the importance of keeping all ports open to humanitarian and commercial vessels. I am committed to working with all stakeholders to achieve this as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to seeing commercial imports of critical supplies stabilize at adequate levels. 

Commercial imports alone will not be enough to address the vast humanitarian crisis in Yemen or to provide a sustainable solution. I therefore reiterate my call for all parties to the conflict to provide unconditional, sustained humanitarian access – for both staff and supplies – across the country and without interference. I also call on all parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and engage meaningfully with the United Nations to achieve an inclusive, negotiated political settlement.

The WHO Health Emergencies Programme is currently monitoring 51 events in the region. This week’s edition covers key new and ongoing events, including:

- Declaration of the control of cholera outbreak in Borno State, Nigeria   
- Hepatitis E in Namibia   
- Humanitarian crisis in Central African Republic  
- Cholera in South Sudan  

 For each of these events, a brief description followed by public health measures implemented and an interpretation of the situation is provided.

**Major challenges include:**

- The humanitarian crisis in Central African Republic continues to deteriorate in the central region of the country. The seasonal migration of people and livestock to new grazing grounds is expected to trigger increased violence in the centre and northeast regions of the country and with it, even greater need for humanitarian assistance. The insecurity in the region must be urgently addressed to facilitate an effective response by WHO and partners.  

- The outbreak of cholera in South Sudan has markedly decreased as a result of concerted efforts by the national authorities and humanitarian actors.

2391444,"FSNAU Nutrition Update: November 2017 **Highlights** 

The 2017 Deyr season nutrition assessment among Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the main settlements and two urban areas shows Critical prevalence of acute malnutrition (Global Acute Malnutrition-GAM ≥ 15%) in 5 out of 15 population groups surveyed in November: Qardho IDPs, Galkacyo IDPs, Garowe, Mogadishu IDPs and Baidoa IDPs - see Map 1 and Table 2.  

However, the nutrition situation among IDPs in Baidoa, Dhusmareeb Hargeisa and Berbera has shown statistically significant improvement since June 2017 (Gu season). The 2017 Deyr assessment results for IDPs in Mogadishu, Dolow and Bossaso also reflect decreases in GAM and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence since 2017 Gu although these changes are not statistically significant.  

**Assessment Overview** 

FSNAU and partners conducted joint Nutrition and Food security assessment among 15 population groups (13 IDP and two urban) across Somalia in November 2017 (Table 1). The objective of the assessments was to monitor the nutrition situation of IDPs in the 13 main IDP settlements and in selected urban areas (Mogadishu and Kismayo) as part of FSNAU’s biannual surveillance activities.  

A two-stage probability proportionate to size (PPS) cluster sampling protocol, based on SMART Methodology was used, with the exception of Qardho, Berbera and Dhusamareb IDP settlements where sampling was exhaustive. Retrospective mortality data for 136 days prior to the assessments was also collected among all sampled households. Mortality, food security and nutritional data was collected concurrently from the same households. Variables (anthropometric and all other contextual indicators) and mortality were entered using EPI info soft 3.5.4 and ENA SMART software (July 9th, 2015 version), respectively. For quality assurance, enumerators and supervisors received five days of training prior to data collection. During the field work, anthropometric dataset were checked on a daily basis using ENA SMART software plausibility parameters.  

GAM was estimated using World Health Organization growth standards, while Crude Death Rates (CDRs) and Under-Five Death Rates (U5DR) for children less than 5 years of age were calculated using the most recent population estimates available (UNDP PESS, 2014; CCCM DSA in Baidoa). The event used to calculate the recall period for the 2017 Deyr mortality assessment among IDP/urban populations was the beginning of Eidul Fitir religious holiday (i.e. 25 June 2017). Nutrition status of a total of 10 271 children (6-59 months) drawn from 7 412 households was assessed among 13 IDPs and two urban settlements covered in the 2017 Deyr assessment.",4595,"Health"

- On 6 December, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres said following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that, “Jerusalem  is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides”.

- For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which has further undermined an already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 2017 in the context of disputes between the de-facto authorities in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely impacted the availability of essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and has undermined Gaza’s fragile economy, especially the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. In the already impoverished Gaza Strip, residents have learned to adapt to the fact that electricity is only available for between two and four hours a day. The shortages have defined how people live their lives: getting up in the middle of the night if there is power to run washing machines or turn on water pumps. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory, electricity blackouts in Gaza last between 19-21 hours each day. Families in Gaza are forced to spend a large part of their income on energy, whether on the meagre supply of electricity they receive through high voltage lines, or on the cost of fuel, generators and their repair.

- A ceremony to mark the International Day of Human Rights was organized by the UNRWA Field Education Programme at Beach Preparatory Girls School A in Beach camp, western Gaza city, on 11 December. The Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, and other senior UNRWA staff as well as teachers, students and their parents attended the event. The event included activities such as songs, sketches and a drawing competition for the students. The parents also participated in an activity where they shared their views on gender equality and non-discrimination in the Gaza Strip, wishing for a better future for all. For over ten years UNRWA has been integrating human rights, conflict resolution and tolerance in its school activities. In May 2012, the Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA. This policy builds upon past successes, but also draws from international best practices and paves the way to better integrate human rights education in all our schools.

- An online lecture with the Japanese Research Syowa Station in Antarctica was conducted via Skype to a group of 30 students from two UNRWA schools on 11 December 2017. Dr. Hirofumi Oe, the station’s medical doctor, introduced the life in Antarctica and the mission of the research station to the students. The lecture lasted for two hours and included a presentation with photos and videos followed by an open discussion during which the students raised a number of questions such as the impact of climate change on the world, and Antarctica in particular. Commenting on the lecture, Dr. Hirofumi expressed his pleasure in speaking with UNRWA students in Gaza, explaining the environment of Antarctica, and the purpose and activities of the Japanese research mission there. The lecture was a great opportunity to widen both the knowledge and horizon of students in Gaza. Freedom of movement outside Gaza is virtually non-existent due to the blockade; 90 per cent of the over 271,900 students from UNRWA schools have never left the Gaza Strip in their lives. The UNRWA Education Programme recognizes the critical need for students to understand and connect with the world, and hence always seeks to implement innovative projects through which refugee students can link to, and share knowledge and ideas with, their peers and others in the rest of the world.

- UNRWA in Gaza celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 4 December 2017. The ceremony took place at the UNRWA Gaza Field Office compound and was attended by UNRWA Director of Operations, Mr. Matthias Schmale, Chief of the Field Relief and Social Services Programme, Mr. Asem Abu Shawish, UNRWA senior staff as well as heads of community rehabilitation centres that provide support to persons with disabilities across the Gaza Strip. The ceremony included speeches by Mr. Schmale, representatives from the coordination committee of the community rehabilitation centres, and a representative of persons with disabilities. It also included many uplifting performances by children with disabilities. The disability sub-programme of the UNRWA Relief and Social Services Programme provides various forms of support to people with disabilities and assists vulnerable groups of Palestine refugees through community social interventions. It conducts activities through 19 Community-Based Organizations, 7 Women’s Programme Centres, 7 Community-Based Rehabilitation Centres for persons with disabilities and 5 Youth Activity Centres.

- During the reporting period, as part of his regular outreach visits, the Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, visited Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, and Gaza City. During the visit to Khan Younis camp, the Director met with a beneficiary family receiving Social Safety Net support due to their extreme poverty and visited UNRWA Abu Teama Preparatory Co-ed school. In his visit to Gaza city, Mr. Schmale met with members of the School Parliament and their teachers at the UNRWA Gaza Preparatory Girls A, and then proceeded to Tuffah Distribution Centre, a Community-Based Rehabilitation Centre and the Sheikh Radwan Health Centre. The visit was followed by a meeting with UNRWA Health Programme senior staff in which the Chief of the Field Health Programme, Dr. Ghada Al-Jadba, highlighted the programme’s achievements and challenges in 2017.

On 7, 8, 9, 14 and 18 December, Israeli Forces fired missiles targeting militant training locations across the Gaza Strip in response to mortar shells fired by militants. Two deaths and 16 injuries were reported.

**UNRWA’S RESPONSE**

**THE UNRWA JOB CREATION PROGRAMME: PROVIDING A SOURCE OF INCOME AND STRENGTHENING SELF-RELIANCE**

The blockade of Gaza entered its 11th year in June 2017. The heavy restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza , in addition to the three consecutive conflicts and the internal political divide, have not only crushed the enclave’s formerly trade-based economy, they are also heavily responsible for the sky-rocketing unemployment rates. Extreme poverty, food insecurity and confinement contribute to depression, and hopelessness. According to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in Gaza was at 46.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.Even more dramatically, 71 per cent of females in Gaza are reportedly unemployed.
Through the UNRWA Job Creation Programme (JCP), the Agency works to mitigate the impact of the collapsed economy and labour market in Gaza by providing livelihood opportunities for Palestine refugees.

41-year-old Palestine refugee Enshirah Al-Batah, who lives with her nine-member family in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza Strip, received a three-month work opportunity as a labourer in an agriculture project in Beit Lahia as part of UNRWA’s JCP activities.

“I applied for a position in the UNRWA Job Creation Programme seven years ago. I felt blessed and happy when UNRWA called to inform me that I got a three-month job opportunity. Every morning I go to work with my colleagues and start my work with hope and passion. We pick and package strawberries and prepare them for possible export,” Enshirah said.

The programme targets both skilled and unskilled workers as well as professionals. Priority is given to applicants from households who have been assessed as living below the poverty line of less than US$ 3.87 per person per day; other criteria are gender, age, skills, or location. UNRWA aims to provide 40 per cent of skilled opportunities to women and 40 per cent of all job opportunities to youth. UNRWA also offers thousands of opportunities for graduates from Gaza universities through its Graduate Training Programme.

“This is my first paid job ever. Due to my family’s difficult economic conditions, I received little education. I can hardly read and write so it’s not easy to find a job. At the beginning, it was hard to adapt with the new routine, but now I can’t wait until morning comes to see my friends. I feel more confident and productive,” Enshirah added.

The Job Creation Programme provides not only a source of income, but also helps to restore self-respect, dignity and some form of self-reliance to thousands of Palestine refugees. The money earned through short-term job opportunities is mostly spent to cover basic needs such as medicine, fresh food, or clothes.

“I use the money I gain to repay my family debts and pay for my daughter’s college tuition. My dreams and hopes are simple. I dream of having a stable source of income,” Enshirah added.

In the first nine months of 2017, UNRWA created job opportunities for 16,515 beneficiaries, injecting US$ 12.4 million into the Gaza economy. To address high levels of youth unemployment in Gaza, a sub-component of the JCP – the Graduate Training Programme – offered 2,799 (out of the total of 16,515 jobs) opportunities to recent graduates in 2017 to date.

**FUNDING NEEDS**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget in 2017. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

Following the 2014 conflict, US$ 316 million has been pledged in support of UNRWA’s emergency shelter programme, for which an estimated US$ 720 million is required. This leaves a current shortfall of US$ 404 million. UNRWA urgently appeals to donors to generously contribute to its emergency shelter programme to provide displaced Palestine refugees in Gaza with rental subsidies or cash assistance to undertake reconstruction of their demolished homes.

As presented in UNRWA’s occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) Emergency Appeal for 2017, the Agency is seeking US$ 402 million to meet the minimum humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees in the oPt. The Gaza portion of the Emergency Appeal amounts to US$ 355 million for 2017, to address protracted, large scale humanitarian needs. More information can be found [here](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/emergency-appeals/opt-emergency-appeal-2017).

**CROSSINGS**

Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have undermined the living conditions of 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, Erez crossing and Kerem Shalom crossing. Rafah crossing is controlled by the Egyptian authorities and technically allows for the movement of a number of authorized travelers, Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases only. Erez crossing is controlled by Israeli authorities and technically allows for the movement of aid workers and limited numbers of authorized travelers, including Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases. Kerem Shalom crossing, also controlled by Israeli authorities, technically allows for the movement of authorized goods only.",4595,"Health"
2391279,"New Zealand commits 1 million NZD to help UNFPA meet the humanitarian needs of women and girls amid the Rohingya crisis Cox’s Bazar 23 December 2017 - The New Zealand government has committed 1 million NZD to help UNFPA address the sexual and reproductive health and protection needs of women and girls, and to aid survivors of gender-based violence amid the Rohingya humanitarian response.

Since the 25th of August, 655,000 Rohingya refugees have entered Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh from neighbouring Rakhine State in Myanmar. Now four months into the crisis, the needs on the ground – for shelter, food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare and protection – remain staggering. And the unique health and safety needs of women and girls – who represent over half of arrivals – compounded and far from being met.

More than 30,000 women among the new arrivals are pregnant, and almost 11,000 are expected to give birth by the end of February 2018. Nearly 1,500 are at risk of life-threatening pregnancy complications and need access to functioning health facilities for delivery.

Overcrowding and limited privacy across the camps and settlement areas have heightened risks of gender-based violence and exploitation for women and girls. Up to one in five Rohingya refugee families are female-headed, exhibiting even greater vulnerability.

The New Zealand government’s funding commitment recognizes that women and girls are particularly impacted by the crisis. “We commend UNFPA’s tireless efforts to support women and girls impacted by the Rohingya refugee crisis,” said Craig John Hawke, Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations. “We recognize the important role UNFPA plays in delivering lifesaving sexual and reproductive health care and safeguarding the rights of women and girls and we are pleased to support these efforts.”

UNFPA is working in partnership with the Bangladesh Government, UN agencies, and international and local organizations to meet the health and protection needs of the most vulnerable women and girls in Cox’s Bazar, including Rohingya refugees and host communities. Iori Kato, Acting Representative of UNFPA Bangladesh lauds New Zealand’s timely support to scale up the response. “Currently, there is no end in sight to this crisis. With more women and girls arriving from Myanmar by the day, this funding is crucial for the scale up of our lifesaving reproductive health and gender-based violence prevention and response services. We are grateful for the Government of New Zealand’s show of leadership, helping to ensure women and girls are not left behind in this response.”

Employees from BD, Eli Lilly, GSK, Merck, Henry Schein, Mylan and Sanofi spoke about the responsibility to step up and support communities in times of need, as their companies had done. 

“We felt that we owed it to the patients to help them in these terrible times,” Eli Lilly’s Marirosa Rosado told the audience. “We were really proud to help.”

Pharmaceuticals are a main export of Puerto Rico, and many companies have production facilities and offices located across the island. 

Facilities lost power, some were seriously damaged, and all were impacted in some way by Hurricane Maria. 

Employees were no exception.

Some required assistance themselves in the storm’s immediate aftermath. Others took in relatives or neighbors, volunteered their time, worked overtime – nights and weekends – in harsh conditions, doing whatever they could to help their friends, families, anyone in need.

As they spoke, it was evident that everyone experienced the storm’s impacts on a deeply personal level.

“It’s a very good example of what we can do even in the worst of times,” GSK’s Jose Ramirez said.

The supplies began departing the warehouse Tuesday morning, bound for more than 20 health centers across Puerto Rico.

Among the recipients was the Health ProMed clinic in Vieques, an island that was particularly hard-hit by both Hurricanes Irma and Maria.

Each day, power extends to more parts of Puerto Rico. But residents of Vieques are still waiting in long lines for gas to run their generators, going more than 100 days without grid electricity. 

Tuesday’s delivery was packed with essential medicines and supplies requested by staff at that location, which is the only health center on the island.

Salud Integral de Montana in Naranjito, located 20 miles southwest of San Juan, was another health center that received a shipment of critical medicines this week. The only health center for miles around, Salud Integral de Montana serves the mountainous communities on the northern slopes of Cordillera Central.

Each of the other two dozen hospitals and clinics to receive shipments are in similarly precarious positions, post-Maria. Power is unreliable. Many facilities sustained damage. Health center staff return home after long shifts to many of the same challenges their patients face.

The latest shipment won’t solve all of those problems. But more medicine on pharmacy shelves means clinicians have one less thing to worry about.

2391254,"Bangladesh: Crisis update – December 2017 **Since 25 August, MSF has massively scaled up its operations in Cox's Bazar, [Bangladesh](http://www.msf.org/en/where-we-work/bangladesh).**

**Number of MSF health facilities:** 19 health posts, three primary health centres and four inpatient health facilities

**Number of staff:** 2,258 national and international staff as of the end of November

**Number of patients:** 142,985 patients have been treated at MSF outpatient facilities and 3,117 patients in inpatient facilities between the end of August and the end of November

**Main morbidities:** respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and an increase in diphtheria cases

**Other activities:** water and sanitation (water trucking, hand pump, tube well and latrine installation) and mental health services

We now manage 19 health posts, three primary health centres and four inpatient facilities. Around 2,300 people work for MSF in the Cox’s Bazar district. The main morbidities among patients in our clinics are respiratory tract infections, diarrhoeal diseases and increasing cases of infant malnutrition, which are directly related to the poor living conditions, particularly the state of shelter, water and sanitation in the settlements.

By the end of November, we saw 2,165 cases of measles across all MSF health facilities and more than 77 cases of jaundice.

In addition, the number of suspected diphtheria cases we see at our health facilities has increased. By 21 December, we had treated more than 2,000 patients, most of whom were aged between five and 14 years.

Without an antitoxin, diphtheria can result in a high case-fatality rate. Only a limited quantity arrived in Bangladesh recently.

Active case investigation began in most of the settlements where MSF is working to see if anyone else was sick in the patients’ households. We also collected information about the number of household members and any other contacts the patients had prior to presentation. Contacts are being treated prophylactically with antibiotics via the health facilities. The preparation and establishment of a reserved isolation area for suspected cases are ongoing.

Most of these vaccine-preventable diseases are further examples of how little access the Rohingya population in Myanmar had to routine healthcare. We’ve worked on expanding our isolation capacity for measles and other infectious diseases in most of our facilities.

In response to inpatient capacity needs, we’ve increased the number of beds at our facilities in Kutupalong and our newly-built health facility in Balukhali. We’ve also opened a new 25-bed inpatient facility in the Tasnimarkhola settlement. It’s the only inpatient centre in the area. Another, which was due to open near Moynarghona makeshift settlement, is functioning as a temporary 85-bed diphtheria treatment centre.

In preparation for a potential outbreak of cholera or other diarrhoeal diseases, we have identified sites for diarrhoea treatment units in Balukhali, Hakimpara, Jamtoli, and Unchiprang. Preparations are ongoing.

**MSF project locations in Cox’s Bazar**

**Kutupalong**

More than 547,000 refugees are now living in makeshift settlements in Kutupalong and Balukhali, as well as the expansion site. The MSF Kutupalong health facility has operated since 2009 and is our biggest in Cox’s Bazar. Among the services in this clinic are: a 24-hour emergency room; an outpatient department; an inpatient department, which includes a paediatric and neonatal ward; isolation beds; a diarrhoea treatment ward; sexual and reproductive healthcare services; a mental health department, and basic laboratory services.

Since 25 August, the inpatient department has expanded from 50 to 79 beds to cope with the influx and the increasing numbers of patients. Its isolation capacity was also increased to cope with a potential outbreak of communicable diseases. The outpatient department treats more than 300 patients per day. We plan to rehabilitate the hospital, increase the number of beds and improve the overall infrastructure in the hospital to meet the needs of the growing population. Construction work began in November and will continue through to the new year.

MSF has built and manages three health posts in Kutupalong makeshift settlement expansion area. The health posts treat over 300 patients per day and are located throughout the settlement to provide access to newly arrived refugees.

**Balukhali**

At the end of October, we opened a 40-bed mother and child inpatient facility in Balukhali, near the existing outpatient clinic. In early December, this was converted into a diphtheria treatment centre in response to the rapidly growing outbreak of the disease. We now have 70 beds in the facility for treating diphtheria patients. We also run three health posts in this settlement.

**Balukhali 2**

Since 1 October, MSF has run a health post in Balukhali 2, which has a population of 285, 000. The health provides basic primary healthcare and treated more than 18,100 people between 1 October and 11 December. Newly arrived refugees are being settled in the zone named SS, which includes Balukhali 1 and Balukali 2. On 18 November, MSF opened a health post in the SS zone that treats an average of 170 patients per day.

**Tasnimarkhola**

More than 58,000 refugees live in Tasnimarkhola’s makeshift settlement, formerly known as Burma Para. MSF opened a health post on 26 October and treated 12,400 patients by 11 December. Around 30 per cent of consultations there are for children under five. On 3 December, we started sexual and reproductive health activities (antenatal, postnatal, sexual and gender-based violence, gynaecological consultations and family planning).

On 26 November, we opened a 25-bed inpatient facility. The hospital focuses on paediatrics (children below the age of 15), inpatient treatment of severe acute malnutrition (10 per cent of hospitalised patients) and the management of measles cases (55 per cent of hospitalised patients). To accommodate the high number of measles cases, we had to increase the number of isolation beds to 36. By 11 December we received 320 patients in the emergency room. Of these, 171 (53 per cent) were hospitalised.

We’ve drilled four deep production boreholes to provide water to the health posts and inpatient department.

**Unchiprang**

More than 23,300 refugees live in Unchiprang’s makeshift settlement. MSF runs a primary health centre, which initially opened as health post in mid-September. We provide around-the-clock primary healthcare, sexual and reproductive healthcare and mental health services, with 10 hospitalisation beds. We are the main health-care provider in the settlement and our team carries out more than 150 consultations per day. We’ve opened a second health post in Uchiprang and another in nearby Nayapara and treat 200 cases daily in both.

**Jamtoli**

Jamtoli makeshift settlement has a population of 48,400. The health post MSF opened there in September was later upgraded later to a primary healthcare centre. The clinic currently receives up to 250 patients per day and offers 24-hour primary health care service, with a delivery room and 18 hospitalisation beds. We run two other health posts in Jamtoli.

**Hakimpara**

More than 33,000 refugees live in Hakimpara’s makeshift settlement. The health post we opened there has been upgraded to a primary healthcare centre with 24-hour primary health care services and 14 hospitalisation beds. We treat around 150 patients per day there. We also run two other health posts.

**Moynarghona**

More than 19,500 refugees live in Moynarghona’s makeshift settlement. MSF started a mobile clinic in September, which has since been upgraded to a health post. The clinic sees an average of 200 patients per day. Before the end of the year, we plan to open an inpatient department with a 63- bed capacity outside the settlement. It will offer an emergency room and a paediatric and inpatient therapeutic feeding centre for the Rohingya and host communities. In the meantime, this site has been used as an 85-bed diphtheria treatment centre since 11 December.

**Sabrang entry point**

On 8 October, we started a mobile clinic at the border point in Sabrang, offering nutritional screening and basic healthcare and monitoring. Its services have been integrated into the reception centre’s circuit.

**Other activities**

**Vaccination**

MSF is vaccinating children and pregnant women in its facilities to support the government’s initiative to expand routine vaccination in the camps. Staff at all our health facilities will have the capacity to administer immunisation for measles and rubella, oral polio and tetanus according to national protocols.

From 18 November, the Ministry of Health ran a 12-day measles and rubella vaccination catch-up campaign targeting more than 336,000 children between the age of six months and 15 years. MSF supported this campaign with community mobilisation, site identification, logistics and the transportation of vaccines. A vaccination coverage survey is planned in mid-December to evaluate the success of the campaign.

**Sexual violence**

**Key figures:**

- **Total number of sexual violence cases from 25 August to 3 December:** 113

- **Number of rape cases:** 91

- **Number of sexual and gender-based violence cases under the age of 18:** 37

- **Number of cases of male on male sexual violence:** 0

Since 25 August, we've treated 113 survivors of sexual violence at our sexual and reproductive health unit in Kutupalong. Of these, 33 per cent were under the age of 18, including one under the age of ten.

Estimating the number of survivors is not possible. But sexual violence is often under-reported due to stigma and shame, fear of reprisals, a lack of knowledge about the medical consequences of sexual violence and the need for timely medical care, and a lack of awareness about the medical and psychological support available.

Given these barriers, it is likely that the number of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence MSF has treated so far is just a fraction of reality.

We are starting to see more survivors seeking medical care because some of these women and girls have become pregnant as a result of rape.

MSF has specialised staff on the ground to treat survivors who are referred for treatment as a result of trauma, including sexual assault and rape. Our local community outreach workers visit people living in the settlements and inform them about our free services, which include treatment for sexual violence.

**Water and Sanitation (WASH)**

Beyond our medical response, improving water and sanitation is a major part of our attempts to prevent the spread of disease. According to the WHO[[1]](http://www.msf.org/en/article/bangladesh-crisis-update-%E2%80%93-december-2017#_ftn1), 91 per cent of households and 60 per cent of source samples were contaminated with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Due to the lack of a drainage system, stagnant water is present in 26 per cent of all tube wells. As for sanitation, 39 per cent of emergency latrines installed by WASH partners, mostly at the early stage of the emergency response, are non-functional. The desludging and decommissioning of these latrines remains a priority to improve the inadequate sanitation environment.

MSF is targeting its water and sanitation response in the most difficult to reach areas. So far, we have built 1,247 latrines, 157 water wells and a gravity water supply system in the settlements located in the north and south.

By the end of December, we aim to install 400 boreholes and 1,000 latrines in the Balukhali and Kutupalong makeshift settlements. As the shallow aquifer (the main water source, abundant in quantity and easy to access) is contaminated with fecal coliforms throughout the camps, we started drilling production boreholes between 150 and 200 metres deep to have clean water. To date, four deep boreholes have been drilled.

We plan to start hygiene promotion, clean latrines, educate about hand washing, and distribute soap and other non-food items in MSF facilities. To ensure vulnerable population have clean drinking water, we also plan to distribute water filters in our clinics in Tasnimarkhola and Balukali 2 to patients with malnutrition and measles, and pregnant women. In the southern settlements of Unchiprang and Jamtoli, we aim to build 56 more latrines and 43 wells in the coming weeks.

Our emergency response for new arrivals also includes water supply and sanitation. We have deployed teams to arrival, transit and settlement locations to ensure that newly arrived refugees have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities.

As the settlements continue to expand, refugees have inequitable access to basic needs such as healthcare services, food and water. The military is currently working on a new road but additional improvements and humanitarian services are urgently needed to ensure aid is reaching all those with basic needs and to limit further hardship and the risk of public health problems.

2391244,"Contraceptive implant brings comfort and joy to Myanmar women When the mobile reproductive health team arrives in Bhyat Kha village in Kayin, Myanmar, the clinic is already bursting with clients. The health assistant in the village has used Facebook Messenger to spread the word: Today, the mobile health team are bringing contraceptive implants!

It is going to be a hot day. The clinic is crowded. The queue is building up. But spirits are high, and women are chatting and waiting patiently for their turn. Some are spilling out into the garden area, where husbands help to look after the children. Some families have brought lunch, knowing it may be a long day.

Dr Sett Aung Naing and his mobile outreach team from UNFPA partner Marie Stopes International quickly unpack their pick-up truck and get ready to start the day’s work.

“I was pregnant every two years”

One of the women who have arrived early is Ou Lu. She is 37 years old and she has seven children. Shy and soft-spoken, she says that when she got married, she hoped to have a family with two children. But she and her husband – a migrant farm worker – are poor. They could not afford contraceptives. Ou Lu became pregnant every two years.

Then, after giving birth to her sixth child, she was able to access the 3-month contraceptive injection for free. Life started to look up for the family.

“When I didn’t have to breastfeed and take care of a new baby, I was able to take on work outside my home and earn some extra money. We used it for school uniforms and books”, says Ou Lu. “But with my husband mostly away, I have so many responsibilities. One time I was not able to visit the clinic in time for my contraceptive refill, and I got pregnant again.”

The reproductive health assistant demonstrates the implant.

**“I feel safe now”**

Her youngest child is a lovely little boy with a cheeky smile. But her feelings about becoming a mother for the seventh time are mixed. She has had to give up her work. Without the extra income, her older children now stay at home instead of going to school. There is not enough money for uniforms and books. So when Ou Lu heard about the contraceptive implant, she did not hesitate.

“With the implant, I cannot get pregnant for five years. I have worried so much about this for such a long time. Now I finally feel safe. I trust the doctor. The implant is a good thing for my family and I”, says Ou Lu.

**Five years of protection**

Contraceptive implants are long-acting reversible contraceptives. Inserted under the skin of the upper arm with a small incision, the implant prevents unintended pregnancy for up to five years. But it is also reversible. If a woman would like to try for another baby, the implant is removed, and she can become pregnant again.

Over the last three years, UNFPA has invested overUS$2 million in implants in Myanmar. Through a collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Sports, implants are offered for free in public health facilities. NGO partners provide the implants for free or for a reduced price.

**Exhausted but happy**

By the end of the day, Dr Sett Aung Naing and his team are exhausted but also happy. Dozens of women have received contraceptive implants, as well as family planning counselling and other types of contraceptives, today. But although the team have worked tirelessly not everyone has had their turn.

“We have so many villages to serve that we can only come a few times per year to each village”, says Dr Sett as he wipes his brow in the heat of the late afternoon.

“But I just cannot leave these women to wait for months for family planning advice and contraceptives. Even if it’s a long journey, the team and I have decided to change our schedules so that we can return to Bhyat Kha tomorrow morning so that everyone who’s come to see us will be served.”

2391144,"WHO helps Nigeria control cholera in Borno state **Maiduguri, Nigeria, 22 December 2017** - Nigeria has successfully contained a five-month cholera outbreak in conflict-affected Borno state, with support from the World Health Organization and other health partners.

The Government [announced](https://reliefweb.int/node/2391139/) the end of the outbreak on Thursday (December 21) after two weeks had passed with no new cases.

“With the support of WHO and other health actors, Borno State moved to quick action to control the outbreak. With that strong resolve to limit mortality and morbidity, this was achieved, and we can say that we have succeeded,” said Dr Muhammad Aminu Ghuluze, Director of Emergency Response, Borno State Ministry of Health.

A major Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign contributed to the effort – the first of its kind in Nigeria.

With support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) provided 1.8 million OCV doses to immunize 900,000 people in two rounds between September and December this year.

Following an initial spike in cases, the number of new infections dropped significantly after the vaccination campaign concluded.

“Containing cholera in the midst of an ongoing conflict is a major accomplishment,” said Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Representative in Nigeria. “No single measure would have worked on its own. This was a joint effort employing a range of tools by many partners under the leadership of the State Ministry of Health.”

The outbreak began in August on the outskirts of Maiduguri, and quickly spread through several camps for internally displaced persons and host communities. By 19 December, 5,365 suspected cases had been reported, including 61 deaths.

An early warning and surveillance system supported by WHO was critical to providing data on suspected cases in different locations. WHO pinpointed where the outbreak was expanding and contracting through a GIS “dot mapping” approach, which allowed WHO and partners to effectively target interventions.

The response included providing safe chlorinated water, identifying and treating the sick in established cholera treatment centres, reaching out to communities with information on cholera prevention, and facilitating laboratory testing to confirm new cases.

Partnerships with local media helped to ensure that people in affected and neighbouring communities were aware of the risk of cholera, how it is spread, how to prevent it, and the importance of seeking treatment when they experience the symptoms.

Due to ongoing conflict, many people in north-eastern Nigeria have not had access to basic healthcare and routine immunizations for years, and health conditions in many camps for internally displaced persons are sub-standard.

WHO is working with the Government and health sector partners to improve access to basic health services, including to areas considered inaccessible until only recently. However, a recent uptick in the conflict in Borno and neighbouring states has led to new displacements increasing the future risks of disease outbreaks.

“While the achievements of the cholera programme in Borno State are a significant milestone, cholera is endemic to north-eastern Nigeria and future outbreaks remain likely,” said Dr Alemu. “We must be vigilant to the warning signs that could signal another outbreak of cholera or other epidemic-prone diseases.”

In line with the [Global Roadmap for Ending Cholera by 2030](http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap.pdf), WHO will continue to support Nigeria to prepare for and prevent cholera by focussing on prevention and preparedness in hotspots across the country.

**Note to editors**

10.2 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in north-eastern Nigeria. More than half are women and girls. Children make up 63 per cent of those needing assistance. The most acute humanitarian needs are concentrated in Borno State – and areas bordering Borno in Adamawa and Yobe states – where the crisis shows no sign of abating.

To continue providing basic health services, while looking to rebuild north-eastern Nigeria’s health system, the health sector is seeking US$109.5 million to help 5.1 million people in 2018.",4595,"Health"
2391139,"Address to the media on the end of cholera outbreak in Borno State December 21, 2017 Maiduguri, Borno State 

Distinguished colleagues, the members of the media community, champions of humanitarianism, friends, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning all and a warm welcome. 

I must thank you all for your time and above all for the courage to have remained steadfast during the period of this cholera outbreak. 

We are all here today because we have contributed one way or the other to control the outbreak that we have come to close. On 16 August this year, the State government through the State ministry of Health got report of cases suspected to be cholera in the Muna garage IDP camp. With the support of WHO and other health actors moved to quick action to control outbreak, with that strong resolve to limit mortality and morbidity, this was achieved, and we can say that we have succeeded. A little over 5000 cases was recorded across 6 Local governments area in Borno state, Jere, MMC, Dikwa, Monguno, Mafa and Guzamala LGAs and with 61 deaths reported. 

The cholera outbreak ongoing in other parts of the world was a wake-up call, that if we toy with it, it will toy with us. Given the weakened health system resulting from long years of insurgency and the high population density in Muna garage camp, made it paramount for immediate and coordinated response to avoid pit falls experienced by other nations with similar challenges. I must say that we have succeeded in controlling the outbreak. 

This, certainly was as a result of the multi sectoral strategy adopted and the very strong partner leadership from WHO in coordinating with other implementing partners to support the state in closing identified gaps in surveillance, risk communication, water and sanitation among others. The preparedness of the health cluster to respond to cholera outbreak, effective partner coordination, swift activation of the Emergency Operations Center, efficient case management and surveillance were the strong points that helped us disrupt transmission and reduced mortality to about 1%, as this could have been worse given previous outbreak like that in 2010. Today, we are more than 2 weeks without any case reported and this signifies that we have come to the end of this outbreak. 

Our collaborative effort proved very useful in this instance and has shown that working together we achieve faster and better. Building partnerships across all sectors is the only sure way to work now and in the future. 

The state will now be far prepared and equipped to prevent and respond even better in the event of another outbreak. Now, we must begin to document and harness the lessons learnt, as a contribution to assurance of our collective future.    

I want to thank all partners that supported the implementation of prevention and control strategies, management of cases and providing technical support to our staff on ground.    

We must also seize this as an opportunity to continue to educate and enlighten our people on these strategies as to avert a next occurrence. We still ask that the UN agencies and other partners to continue the good work, keep supporting the state government and her agencies in the quest to provide improved health services for the people of Borno, especially the displaced.    

I must thank specially WHO for that Leadership in the response, Unicef, Oxfam, Solidarite International for support in Water and sanitation, MSF, FHI 360, MDM, ALIMA in case Management and a host of others that I may not have mentioned. We must also recognize the various roles played by the Federal Ministry of Health and her agencies, NCDC, NPHCDA in disrupting this outbreak and collaboration of own MOH staff and other state agencies, SPHCDA, BOSEPA, RUWASSA. The State government and people of Borno state cannot thank you enough.    

By this we declare the cholera outbreak over.    

Thank you,

2391134,"Philippines: Tropical Storm Tembin (MDRPH026) DREF operation update  n° 1 **A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

As Tropical Storm Tembin (local name: Vinta), aims to exits Philippine landmass, the trail of destruction it has left is emerging. Latest information indicates that Tembin has caused dozens – potentially hundreds – of fatalities, damaged thousands of houses, washed away vast amounts of livelihoods and disrupted the lives of people mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao Island in the Philippines.  

According to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Tropical Storm Tembin made landfall in Cateel,  Davao Oriental, on Friday 22 December 2017 afternoon packing maximum winds of 90 kilometres per hour (km/h) and gusts of up to 125 km/h. The tropical storm then continued across Mindanao, tracking over the provinces of Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental and Zamboanga del Norte. It weakened before re-intensifying late Saturday, 23 December, and is now threatening southern parts of Palawan. In a bulletin issued at 17:00h local time on Saturday, PAGASA indicated that Tembi was packing maximum winds of 90 km/h and gustiness of up to 115 km/h.  

According to a report issued by the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s – Fifth DROMIC Report on TS Tembin – as of 23 December 2017 morning the following had been recorded:

• 18,177 families or 72,592 persons are affected in 312 barangays in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, and CARAGA   

• A total of 12,768 families or 50,362 persons are currently staying inside 211 evacuation centres in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, CARAGA  

There are reports of widespread flooding as the major rivers breached their banks. There have also been several reports of flash floods and landslides. Initial reports indicate that at least 106 people have lost their lives, i.e. 47 in Zamboanga del Norte, 36 in Lanao del Norte, 18 in Lanao del Sur, and 5 in Bukidnon. Dozen are missing, with the number of fatalities likely to increase. Confirmed numbers are expected in the coming days as the public authorities verify information being received from the affected provinces.  

Government agencies and local responders – including from the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) – are currently undertaking search and rescue operations. Photos shared by rescuers on social media show rampaging, mud-brown floodwaters sweeping down a highway in Lanao del Sur province, engulfing houses and a van, and people seeking refuge on the upper floors of their homes. There are reports of widespread flooding in Cagayan de Oro, one of Mindanao's largest cities, as well as in Zamboanga City. In Davao City, hundreds of families were evacuated their homes on Friday 22 December night as a major Bankerohan river overflowed, flooding several barangays affecting some 31,000 families.  

The situation continues to evolve and more information should emerge in the coming days. What remains clear is that there is a need for a substantial humanitarian response to help meet the immediate needs of affected communities. Already, some of the affected provinces have been placed under a state of calamity, mainly to allow local government units to utilize budget allocations for immediate response.",4595,"Health"

The World Health Organization (WHO) in Swaziland is pleased to share with its partners and stakeholders its 2014-2015 Biennial Report. This report covers the contribution WHO made towards addressing some of the health challenges and disease burden in the country. Over the two year the health sector made a lot of progress towards improving the health status of the people of Swaziland.  
We applaud the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland for prioritising the health sector in national budget allocation. The Government provides full funding for procurement of essential medicines like antiretroviral drugs and vaccines. We also congratulate the government for developing the second Health Sector Strategic Plan which puts Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as its central theme. The country also successfully hosted the third National Health Research Conference in 2014 and developed a national research agenda for health.  
There have been several achievements during the biennium. The year 2014 saw the government introducing the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13), a cost effective child survival intervention that contributes towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets. In 2015 the Rota Virus vaccine was added to the national routine immunisation schedule. The assent to the Tobacco Products Control Act of 2013 was followed by the development of the National Tobacco Control policy and regulations to the Act in 2014. Significant progress was made towards improving the health of mothers and children in line with attaining MDG 4 and 5. The country also completed the Stepwise approach to disease surveillance (STEPs survey) which provides essential evidence for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Swaziland also successfully conducted the mapping survey for Soil transmitted Helminthiasis and schistosomiasis with support from WHO.  
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Government of Swaziland, development partners, local non-governmental organizations and members of the communities for their support during the biennium.

2383884,"Inside SAMS’s first healthcare facility in Bangladesh Since August, 646,000 Rohingya refugees have fled from Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh. According to the [latest Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-least-6700-rohingya-killed-during-attacks-myanmar) report, at least 6,700 Rohingyas died, mostly due to violence in a brutal military crackdown, between August 25 and September 24. This deeply troubling number includes at least 730 children under the age of five.

Rohingyas have fled into Bangladesh with immense, urgent health care needs, including the need for psychosocial care and treatment for physical trauma. Since September of 2017, SAMS has provided medical care to Rohingyas in Cox’s Bazar through our partnership with local medical organization, Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK).

According to our medical staff on the ground, refugees living in these camps suffer from communicable illnesses, chronic diseases, emotional and physical trauma that have gone untreated due to a scarcity of medical services within the refugee camps.

Recently, in partnership with GK, SAMS opened its first healthcare facility in Bangladesh. The facility is staffed with two doctors, two nurses, a pharmacist, interpreters and local and international medical volunteers. The medical facility provides primary health care, infectious disease control precautions and procedures, and maternal and child health care services for the Rohingya community residing in Cox’s Bazar. The newly inaugurated health facility is equipped to provide medical care that targets not only the primary treatment of disease but also prevention, control and spread of such communicable diseases.

In the month half of December, SAMS and its partners have treated 669 patients, including 329 Female and 340 Male at the Kutupalong, Lambasia camp, one of the two camps where SAMS is located.

Throughout our interactions with patients, many stand out – some are particularly harrowing, signaling the unspeakable brutality with which the Burmese military has targeted civilians.

Momtaz, 32 years old, had five children, three boys and two girls in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. Her husband, three sons, and her infant daughter will killed by the Myanmar military. Momtaz was beaten, raped and locked inside her house before it was set on fire by the military. 

When Momtaz arrived in Bangladesh with her surviving daughter, she was scarred, dehydrated and unconscious for 4 days. Her daughter, who also bears scars of violence, was with her. After repeated psychosocial counselling and dressing of her wounds, she is now recovering slowly. She had sustained burns to the entire right side of her body, including her face and limbs. She complained of hearing problems and difficulty moving her jaw.

SAMS Medical Team Leader, Dr. Salem, examined her ear to find extensive scarring in her external ear. She was then referred to a specialist hospital in Cox’s Bazar. Her hearing now has a chance of being restored. Thought she requires surgical management, she is under routine supervision by SAMS doctors at the SAMS supported clinic to ensure her adequate management and care.

The SAMS clinic also provides health benefits that can be felt across the community. When Khodeja presented with tuberculosis, she was examined by SAMS doctors, and was found to have a history of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is highly contagious, and the SAMS clinic played a significant role in stemming the spread of the disease inside the community. 

Chronic conditions are also difficult to manage in a refugee setting, particularly one as underdeveloped as that in Cox’s Bazar. Another patient, Mohammad, 42 years old, came to SAMS’ clinic with abdominal pain, nausea and blood streaked vomiting. He had been previously diagnosed with Hepatitis C and HIV. He was examined and found to have all the features of chronic liver disease. After a thorough examination of his vitals, he was quickly referred to a tertiary level hospital for confirmation and management of Hepatitis C and HIV. Case reporting was ensured to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and spread.

For Rohingya refugees attempting to find safety in Bangladesh, consistent medical care is vital as they grapple with the lasting physical and emotional trauma they’ve been subjected to. We’re humbled to be the recipients of these stories – in addition to providing dignified care, SAMS doctors also bear witness to the impact of humanitarian crises on the lives of innocents.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2381234,"UNICEF Uganda Humanitarian Situation Report - 1-30 November 2017 **Highlights**

- UNICEF’s Child Protection response remains underfunded with only 14 per cent of humanitarian funding needs met; this has affected the delivery of critical child protection services, especially psychosocial support.

- UNICEF reached nearly 15,000 children in Kween and Kapchorwa districts with health communication activities to support the containment of the Marburg Outbreak. No new cases have emerged.

- As of November, 2017, Uganda is host to over 1,400,000 refugees and asylum seekers from South Sudan, DRC, Burundi and other Countries • Over 200,000 children and women are accessing safe water from motorized systems constructed by UNICEF and Water Mission Uganda and Oxfam.

- In Karamoja, pasture conditions are good due to above average rainfall throughout October and November. As a result, most low-income households can now meet their basic food needs, but face difficulty affording some essential non-food needs.

- Over 1,000 children were enrolled in UNICEF/NRC’s accelerated learning programme in Yumbe District. 

**Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs**

**Refugees:** As of November, 2017, Uganda is host to over 1,400,000 refugees and asylum seekers, of whom over 1 million are from South Sudan, 230,000 from DRC and 40,000 from Burundi. Despite a steady decline in arrivals, the number of new arrivals in Imvepi reception center increased. In the first week of November, the number went up to 687 from 511 in the last week of October, which is likely due to heavy fighting in South Sudan close to the Kerwa collection centre in Yumbe district on November 2, 2017.  

In the education sector, to ensure comprehensive data collection, UNICEF, the Ministry of Education and Sports and partners, are supporting the harmonization of an Early Childhood Development (ECD) mapping tool with the Education Monitoring Information System (EMIS). The ECD mapping is scheduled to start in Yumbe, Adjumani and Kiryandongo refugee settlements within the next few months.  

**Food security in Karamoja region:** The November National Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning (U-NIEWS) bulletin reported that maize crops in the Karamoja region are less favourable than average due to Fall Army Worm (FAW) infestations.  

**Disease Outbreaks and Epidemics:** Cholera cases in Kasese are reducing in the outbreak epicentre of Bwera. However the outbreak is now spreading to other areas that were initially not affected. The Nebbi district outbreak has been successfully contained with no case fatalities reported over a 14-day period since the last case was admitted to the treatment centre. Other alerts of confirmed cholera cases have been registered in Kisoro district, neighbouring the Democratic Republic of Congo. As of 27 November, 2017, 235 cases, with a 1.7 per cent case fatality rate, were registered.  

_Marburg Virus Disease (MVD):_ As of November 2017, the outbreak remains localized in Kween and Kapchorwa districts,the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre of the Ministry of Health (MoH) has not reported new cases. Since October, three cumulative cases of MVD, including two laboratory-confirmed cases and three deaths, have been recorded. UNICEF and partners’ response to the outbreak i focusing on three high risk1 and three moderate risk2 districts in Eastern Uganda.  

_Measles:_ Using the Reach Every District (RED), Reach Every Community/Child (REC) approach, UNICEF and WHO have strengthened routine immunization social mobilization and community outreach activities in hard-to-reach areas. As a result, as of 27 November, 2017, no new measles cases have been reported in Kampala, Jinja, Lyantonde, Wakiso and Lwengo districts. Uganda has also applied to the Measles Rubella Initiative (MRI) to introduce the Measles Rubella Containing vaccine into the routine schedule.  

_Rift Valley Fever (RVF) outbreak:_ On 17 November, 2017, a sample of a 26-year-old male forest worker in Kiboga district was referred to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). Laboratory results from UVRI indicated that he was positive for Rift Valley Fever (RVF). On 23November, 2017, a second case of a 69-year-old male fisherman and farmer from neighbouring Mityana district was reported. The fisherman died on 21November 2017, who was later confirmed to have RVF.  

_Malaria:_ Malaria cases in 10 Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) districts in Northern Uganda is now stabilizing at an average of 50,000 cases per week, with 70 percent of all health units reporting a reduced number of malaria cases. This is a result of a combination of interventions including: social and behaviour change communication to strengthen the use of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs), case management, surveillance, and Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS).",4596,"HIV/Aids"

- The United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission, the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission (MINUSCA), in the CAR until 15 November 2018. The mission's troop level was increased by 900 military personnel.

- The Council reiterated its serious concerns over the ""dire humanitarian situation"" in the country because of the deteriorating security situation, and the lack of access for and attacks against relief workers.

- 20,000 IDPs that had settled in an impromptu camp formed around the UN peacekeeping mission base in Kaga Bandoro, were assisted by IOM to relocate in an operation that began 12 October and continued through November. The camp had formed after ex-Séléka members attacked an IDP camp in Kaga Bandoro in 2016. Close to 700 IDP households had been living in unsafe areas around the airstrip and fuel depot.

- Tensions renewed in Bangui after a grenade exploded Saturday 11 November. More incidents followed on Sunday with a toll of eight dead and 20 wounded. The explosion happened at a concert preaching peace and reconciliation between two rival districts.

538,432 Refugees in neighbouring countries (Chad, Cameroon, DRC, Congo) (UNHCR, 31 Oct 2017)

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

The explosion of violence of the last spring in the South Eastern part of the country (Bangassou, Zémio) has continued to spread into the Center East during November. For example, on the axis Dimbi-Kembe-Pompolo, over 17,000 new displaced persons were identified following rumours and then fighting between armed groups. This axis is a corner stone for humanitarian access to the East of the country and only a few local NGOs are now able to intervene with MINUSCA Force protection.  

In Bria (North East), the security situation is remains worrying. The confrontations between armed groups have caused populations to be displaced repeatedly. The displaced children and families in the PK3 Bria IDP site increased by 24 per cent between September and November (26,747 to 35,499) resulting in an estimated total of about 60,000 IDPs in Bria.  

In the Western region, the sub-prefectures of Bocaranga, Koui and Ngaoudaye have been affected by several peaks of violence forcing the population to be displaced several times since the beginning of 2017. The humanitarian partners in the area have been forced to suspend their activities several times, particularly in Bocaranga, at the end of September. Following a military MINUSCA intervention at the end of October in the area, approximately 15,000 previously displaced persons spontaneously returned to Bocaranga throughout the month of November. Humanitarian partners began resuming activities in the area early in November.",4596,"HIV/Aids"

• UNICEF has established 11 parenting rooms in health facilities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts along the contact line. More than 7,000 children and their parents have benefited from these services.

• During the reporting period, UNICEF provided psychosocial support to over 13,700 children on both sides of the contact line in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

• UNICEF digital campaign on MRE (from June to November) focusing on safe behaviour practices, concluded this month, reaching more than 1.8 million children on living in the Eastern Ukraine. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

The situation in eastern Ukraine remains tense. In November, political instability increased in the nongovernment controlled areas (NGCAs) Luhansk. While reportedly no civilians were targeted, nor armed clashes between the conflicting parties registered so far, the general situation remains unpredictable.  

The overall security situation in communities along the contact line in Donetsk and Luhansk regions remains unstable and slightly deteriorating, with daily ceasefire violations threatening the well-being of children and their families. During November, the daily shelling and shooting also damaged two educational facilities.  

One of these attacks in the NGCA city of Dokuchaievsk on November 20th, damaged a kindergarten in which 50 children as well as parents and staff were present, though no injuries were reported.4 UNICEF continues to advocate with both sides for an end to attacks of schools and kindergartens and the removal of military presence from all educational facilities in line with the “Safe Schools” declaration.  

With the onset of below-zero temperatures across eastern Ukraine, continued damages to water, heating and electrical infrastructure is creating further hardship for children. Key water filtration and pumping stations – including those with potentially dangerous liquefied chlorine – as well as a reservoir were hit by shelling and small arms in November though with comparatively minor damages compared to preceding months. The onset of strong winter-like weather conditions affecting the eastern part of the country are exacerbating already weak health systems as many conflict-damaged medical points remain unrepaired or are housed in temporary locations ranging from former administration buildings to classrooms in active schools.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2377124,"Kenya and Global Fund Sign New Grants to Accelerate Response to Diseases NAIROBI – The Global Fund and health partners in Kenya today signed six grant agreements to strengthen the response to HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. The grants aim to reach 1.3 million people with antiretroviral therapy by 2021, and drastically expand interventions to find more missing cases of TB, among other objectives.

The grants will be managed by three organizations: The National Treasury of Kenya, AMREF Health Africa and Kenya Red Cross Society. The Ministry of Health and county governments will manage the implementation. Kenya has made great progress against HIV and malaria in the last few years. HIV prevalence has reduced from 10.5 percent in 1996 to 5.4 percent in 2016. Since 2009, Kenya has reduced new infections among children by 44 percent. Malaria prevalence went from 11 percent in 2010 to 8 percent in 2015. The Global Fund and other partners have invested together with Kenya to achieve this progress.

The Cabinet Secretary of the National Treasury, Henry Rotich, who signed the agreements, worth US$380 million, on behalf of the Government of Kenya, said: “We are pleased that we can all work together in the fight against diseases. Through this investment, we will accelerate our efforts to respond to HIV, TB and malaria with the aim of ending the devastating effects of these diseases in our country.”

Dr. Cloepa Mailu, Cabinet Secretary of the Ministry of Health said: “The Ministry of Health is committed to continue working in partnership with civil society, development partners, and people affected by diseases to ensure that these investments will have great impact on the Kenyan public.”

The grants include catalytic funding – an investment in programs and activities that can trigger impact in specific key areas in the fight against the three diseases – worth US$24.8 million. This money will be invested in special programs that focus on issues such as human rights, adolescent girls and young women and other people most affected by HIV and TB.

Dr. Ramana Gandham, Chair of the Development Partners for Health in Kenya – a partnership of donor agencies working in Kenya – said: “We commend the inclusive dialogue that took place in the development of these grants, including the involvement of adolescents and young women. As partners, we remain committed to working with the government of Kenya and the Global Fund towards ensuring that the grants achieve maximum impact.”

Abas Gullet, Secretary General of the Kenya Red Cross Society, speaking on behalf of the Civil Society organizations, said: “We are glad that these grants will continue expanding community-based interventions. As civil society organisations, we will continue strengthening our work by reaching people who are most affected by HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Together with the government, we hope to turn the tide against these diseases and achieve Kenya’s health sector goals.”

Linden Morrison, Head of the Global Fund’s High Impact Africa II Department, said: “Kenya is an excellent example of partnership at work. It was inspiring to see how the country designed the grants by conducting a successful country dialogue, ensuring that key partners were engaged and that people most affected by the diseases were put front and center of the investments.”

In line with the Global Fund’s Sustainability, Transition and Co-Financing Policy, which aims to support countries as they move toward fully domestically funded systems for health in response to HIV, TB and malaria, Kenya has committed an additional US$130 million to investments in these diseases.

“We have a historic opportunity to end the three diseases as public health threats,” added Mr. Morrison. “By working together, this partnership can achieve more impact in changing the lives of Kenyans, by contributing to their health and therefore to economic development.”",4596,"HIV/Aids"

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

According to the latest Ministry of Health (MoH) disease outbreak situation report, seven counties (Nairobi, Garissa, Embu, Kirinyaga, Mombasa, Turkana and Wajir) have ongoing cholera outbreaks. From 1 January 2017, 3,967 Cholera cases have been reported with 76 deaths (CFR 1.9%). Following the Marburg Viral Disease (MVD) outbreak in Uganda, preparedness measures are being implemented in Kenya. Nine people at risk from Trans Nzoia County and 10 contacts from West Pokot County were followed up successfully for 21 days, none of which developed symptoms of MVD. Enhanced Surveillance activities will continue for three more months in the respective counties. The measles outbreak reported in Dadaab refugee camps is now under control, with the last case reported on 24 October 2017.

The Kenya Red Cross has reported flash floods in in Turkana, Isiolo, Marsabit, Tana River and Kwale counties in the month of November, with 1,809 households affected. Transportation was disrupted by the floods in Turkana, Marsabit, Baringo and Mandera counties, affecting timely delivery of essential supplies. According to FEWSNET, the short rains have been above average across most of the country as of mid-November, including in Mandera and large parts of Wajir counties.  
However, in other eastern and southern areas, the rainfall amounts have decreased ranging between 25 to 80 percent of normal, with some pockets in south eastern and coastal areas receiving less than 25 percent of normal rainfall. The rains in the arid and semi-arid areas have had positive impact but with varying magnitude. It is likely that there will be some rainfall deficits that could impact both marginal agricultural production and pastoral livelihoods, and any positive impact of the rains is likely to take many months to be felt in terms of improvements on the nutrition outcomes. Parts of the country that have not received the expected rainfall have reported deteriorating food security indicators, including decreased milk production, in the southern Rift (Kajiado and Narok) counties. Nutrition SMART surveys are planned in those counties in January 2018 to assess the nutrition situation of women and children. 

**Humanitarian Strategy and Coordination** 

The Government of Kenya is leading the drought response at both national and county levels. However, the scale of the needs has overwhelmed national structures and capacity to respond. The response capacity was also negatively influenced by the election campaigns, and by delays incurred by the installation of new local governments in many counties.  
In collaboration with the Government of Kenya and partners, UNICEF is leading a catch-up campaign to provide emergency integrated maternal and new-born health intervention to speed up recovery from the impact of the nurse strike and the drought. The UN inter-agency Flash Appeal (launched in September 2017) called for US$ 106 million for humanitarian response, targeting 1.9 million people across the 11 counties facing the highest levels of malnutrition and food insecurity. UNICEF is leading sector coordination for Nutrition and WASH and co-leading Education and Child Protection sectoral coordination. UNICEF is also leading the Garissa and Kisumu humanitarian coordination hubs for election preparedness and response. UNICEF is supporting the drought response through technical support to Government and partners, increased partnerships, delivery of lifesaving interventions and supplies, and is currently conducting a Real-Time Evaluation of the drought response. UNICEF is also supporting floods preparedness and response for the short rains (October to December) season.

A number of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 have targets that relate to health.  

However, one goal – SDG 3 – focuses specifically on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. Target 3.8 of SDG 3 – achieving universal health coverage (UHC), including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all – is the key to attaining the entire goal as well as the health-related targets of other SDGs.  

Target 3.8 has two indicators – 3.8.1 on coverage of essential health services and 3.8.2 on the proportion of a country’s population with catastrophic spending on health, defined as large household expenditure on health as a share of household total consumption or income. Both must be measured together to obtain a clear picture of those who are unable to access health care and those who face financial hardship due to spending on health care. Since the SDGs aim to “leave no one behind”, indicators should be disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, disability, location and migratory status, wherever data allow.

World Humanitarian Data and Trends presents global and country-level data-and-trend analysis about humanitarian crises and assistance. Its purpose is to consolidate this information and present it in an accessible way, providing policymakers, researchers and humanitarian practitioners with an evidence base to support humanitarian policy decisions and provide context for operational decisions.  
The information presented covers two main areas: humanitarian needs and assistance in 2016, and humanitarian trends, challenges and opportunities.  

The report intends to provide a comprehensive picture of the global humanitarian landscape, and to highlight major trends in the nature of humanitarian crises, their drivers, and the actors that participate in prevention, response and recovery. The 2017 edition of the report builds on previous iterations of the report, providing an overview of 2016 as well as selected case studies that can be used for humanitarian advocacy.  

There are many gaps in the available information due to the complexity of humanitarian crises. Even the concepts of humanitarian needs and assistance are flexible. There are also inherent biases in the information. For example, assistance provided by communities and by local and national Governments is less likely to be reported. The outcomes and impact of assistance are difficult to measure and rarely reported. Funding data is more available than other types of information. There are also limitations on the availability and quality of data. Further information on limitations is provided in the ‘User’s Guide’.  

The data presented in this report is from a variety of source organizations with the mandate, resources and expertise to collect and compile relevant data, as well as OCHA-managed processes and tools, such as the inter-agency appeal process and the Financial Tracking Service (FTS). All the data presented in this report is publicly available through the source organizations and through the report’s own data set (available through the Humanitarian Data Exchange).  

Further information on data sources is provided in the ‘User’s Guide’.  

World Humanitarian Data and Trends is an initiative of the Policy Analysis and Innovation Section of OCHA’s Policy Development and Studies Branch.  

This report is just one part of OCHA’s efforts to improve data and analysis on humanitarian situations worldwide and build a humanitarian data community.  

This edition of the report was developed with internal and external partners, whose contributions are listed in the ‘Sources and References’ section. OCHA extends its sincere gratitude to all those partners for their time, expertise and contributions.  

Interpreting the visuals and data The report uses many visual representations of humanitarian data and trends. There is also some limited narrative text and analysis, which provides basic orientation and helps to guide individual interpretation. However, there may be multiple ways to interpret the same information.  

The ‘User’s Guide’ contains more detailed methodological information and specific technical notes for each figure. Readers are encouraged to refer to the technical notes for more detailed descriptions of decisions and assumptions made in presenting the data.

2370744,"FEATURE-Slaughtered by sex, Zambia's 'Sweet Town' survives ravages of AIDS by Lyndsay Griffiths | Thomson Reuters Foundation
Tuesday, 12 December 2017 02:00 GMT

MAZABUKA, Zambia, Dec 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - S ugar brought a rush of people and prosperity to the drab highway stop in southern Zambia they now call ""Sweet Town"" - and with that trade came AIDS.

To mine copper or cut cane, outsiders descended on scruffy, fast-growing towns like Mazabuka, hoping to make a new life and where the men went, a sex industry followed with local women touring bars, inns and truck stops to sell sex to newcomers.

It was a perfect storm for the AIDS epidemic.

""There was a huge mobile population and the district was simply too overwhelmed with men who came without their spouses,"" Jabez Kanyanda, an expert on AIDS, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation during a tour of the Southern Province of Zambia where he leads an HIV prevention programme.

Zambia was one of the world's worst hit countries, part of an African ""AIDS belt"" that left millions dead, with 70,000 people dying a year in the southern African nation at the height of the epidemic in 2003, according to UNAIDS data.

HIV prevalence along key transport routes was especially high, as men and women moved en masse seeking a better life.

""At the peak of the epidemic, no treatment was available. We had a lot of orphans, a lot of widows, a lot of widowers,"" said Kanyanda.

""The doctors knew, of course, but there was nothing they could do ... Every day, you'd pass the graveyard and see people moaning, wailing - yet another funeral.""

The roadside graveyard adjoins the hospital - a crowded field of makeshift memorials and formal headstones, trees arching over red-earth mounds that mark the many dead.

Hand-scrawled signs point to an agony of lost babies: ""beloved daughter Gladsy Mainza"" aged two; nearby lies Tia Jonga, who died on Nov. 7, at under four months old.

""In our hospital setup, every bed space was taken by someone with HIV. In the mortuary, every day, two, three dead bodies,"" Stephen Shajanika, Mazabuka's District Health Commissioner, recalled in an interview.

Now the people of Zambia have moved on from the worst and are learning to live with its aftermath, helped by a military-style campaign to spread information, test those most at risk, and prescribe drugs to keep AIDS at bay.

""We are trying to root out every HIV-positive person. We want to find them. We want to test them. We will do our part and then we empower people who take it very seriously,"" said Kanyanda.

SWEET TOWN

As the centre of the nation's sugar industry, Mazabuka squats on a busy road in land-locked Zambia, a land of transit criss-crossed by truckers from eight neighbouring countries.

As the cane grew, the people followed - pickers from the west, executives from Mauritius and South Africa, European funders and African lorry drivers. Women had less way to gain.

""I've stopped now but it was just the total poverty. You sleep with men to buy food. We just had no money to pay the house rental,"" said Beauty, a 34-year-old former sex worker who now sells sausages. ""I'm a different women now.""

Beauty is not the only one to change.

Testing for the HIV virus is up, knowledge has increased and, most importantly, drugs are available to control the spread of the virus and stop it developing into AIDS.

The United Nations estimates there are still 250 new infections a day in Zambia, but that has dropped 27 percent since 2010 and AIDS-related deaths have fallen 11 percent.

Part of this is due to campaigns like the one run by DAPP, a local NGO that invented a seemingly simple strategy to secure a military-style ""Total Control of the Epidemic"".

Conducted one-on-one, door-to-door, this all-out war aims to mobilise individuals to control their own health and, to that end, has reached more than 1.5 million of 16.5 million Zambians.

Field officers, special forces and troop commanders man the front and rally the troops - the language is no accident.

""We were going in for a fight,"" said Division Commander Kanyanda.

""We needed to organise ourselves like military and show we are in a serious business, fighting a fight with a clear line of command.""

MILITARY CAMPAIGN

At the grass roots, DAPP field officers go hut-to-hut to share stories, win trust and encourage testing, carrying mobile testing kits - a finger pinprick - giving results in 15 minutes.

Truckers get free condoms and lessons on their usage while former sex workers tour bars to spread the message, and revered chieftains go public about their HIV tests to smash stigma.

Each strand is another part of the ""Total Control"" strategy, which began in neighbouring Zimbabwe in 2000, came to ""Sweet Town"" in 2006, then moved to nearby Sinazongwe two years ago.

Sinazongwe's governor - the top government man in a district of nearly 200,000 people - says the plan is working.

""The government will fight HIV/AIDS to the last drop of our blood because it almost wiped out Africans,"" District Commissioner Protacia Mulenga, the government's top official in the region, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""But I'm the governor here and believe me, the government cannot reach where DAPP has reached.""

Mulenga is no bureaucratic bystander to the epidemic. Two of his brothers died of AIDS. His sister is HIV-positive and he cares for her children.

""I saw my brothers dying in pain. There was no treatment,"" he said.

""But now when someone has learnt their status, there's a new control ... They refrain from blood sharing and careless sex.

""What we have done in Zambia needs extending to other countries. The best experience was learnt here and it needs to penetrate further.""",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2370114,"18 Health Innovations Funded by Grand Challenges Canada to Empower World's Most Vulnerable Women and Girls To improve health of women and girls in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Central America, Grand Challenges Canada and partners launch or scale-up 18 projects, bring Canada's new Feminist International Assistance Policy to life.

Toronto - Grand Challenges Canada today announced 18 projects extending innovative forms of health-related lifelines to some of humanity's most acutely impoverished, neglected and vulnerable women and girls, supported by the Government of Canada through Global Affairs Canada.

The undertakings -- in Africa (Kenya (5 projects), Rwanda, Sierra Leone (2), Togo, Uganda (3), Asia (Afghanistan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines), and Central America / Caribbean (Haiti, Nicaragua) -- embrace a range of creative products and services to advance gender equality, promote human dignity, and empower women and girls worldwide. 

The two projects receiving large ""Transition to Scale"" investments will empower young women and girls, and protect and preserve their human dignity, through innovative approaches to improving menstrual, sexual, and reproductive health:

- In Rwanda, an estimated 225,000 adolescent girls in rural areas will gain access to affordable, high-quality menstrual pads made from locally-sourced banana fibres, and a further 7,300 adolescents will receive in-depth menstrual health education through schools and non-governmental organizations. The combination of pads and education will help equip girls to tackle questions about menstruation and discuss their bodies, sexuality, and other areas critical to the healthy growth and empowerment of young women. (Sustainable Health Ventures - Kigali, Rwanda - CDN $1,000,000)

- In Kenya, the Bold Idea for Girls project will seek to reduce HIV infections among 500 vulnerable adolescent girls and young women in informal settlements through a unique combination of HIV/STI education, gender and life skills programming, and vocational and entrepreneurial skills training. In an earlier pilot also supported by Grand Challenges Canada, the project was successful in improving knowledge and awareness of HIV and risky sexual behaviours and practices, increasing reported condom use, as well as sustainable income levels among girls in Nairobi's Mukuru slum. (HOPE worldwide Kenya - Nairobi, Kenya - $135,000)

The 16 proof-of-concept ""Stars in Global Health"" projects (five of which are based in Canada) are focused on advancing the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, and include:

- In Afghanistan, where men customarily make health decisions for women, Canadian innovators will work to educate husbands in Kabul-area refugee camps on family planning, engaging religious leaders to support and sanction the practice, with a goal of gradually shifting traditional attitudes and advancing gender equality. (Rose Charities - Vancouver, Canada)

- In Uganda, a country with one of the world's youngest populations and endemic unemployment, passion fruit farming will be used as a vehicle to empower out-of-school girls with knowledge, life-skills and health information. Girls become financially literate, generating through agribusiness the resources to practice family planning and educate their daughters - breaking the poverty cycle and building healthy communities. (KadAfrica Estate Limited - Fort Portal, Uganda)

- In the Philippines, the country with the highest teen pregnancy rate in Southeast Asia, innovators will use radio to reduce teen pregnancy among hard-to-reach girls in rural and poor areas. The radio program will have three main segments: a talk show featuring interviews with health professionals, a question-and-answer from listeners sent via text message, and a two minute information segment on topics like contraception, menstruation, and conception. (Sciventions - Toronto, Canada)

The new Grand Challenges Canada projects help bring to life the Canadian government's recently adopted Feminist International Assistance Policy. The Policy embraces a feminist approach, one that advances gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, as the most effective way to reduce poverty and to build a more inclusive, peaceful and prosperous world. 

The projects will receive CAD $2.7 million in funding from Grand Challenges Canada, supported by the Government of Canada through Global Affairs Canada. The funding will be complemented by dozens of partner contributions, as well as the collaboration of government and non-governmental agencies in each country, creating a total investment of $3.9 million. 

Comments

""The conditions facing women and girls in low- and middle-income countries almost defy belief but constitute daily reality for millions. Grand Challenges Canada is proud to work with the Government of Canada to enable innovators with bold new ideas to test concepts that may hold the key to a better life for women and girls worldwide, and to scale-up the innovative approaches to empowering women and girls that are already showing promising results.""  
Dr. Peter A. Singer, Chief Executive Officer, Grand Challenges Canada

""Grand Challenges Canada and the Government of Canada share a commitment to advance gender equality, and empower and protect the human rights of women and girls. By investing in innovation, Grand Challenges Canada is helping to champion a world where every woman and girl is empowered to survive and thrive as powerful agents for development and peace.

**Appendix - Project Descriptions**

**Transition to Scale Projects**

***Bringing affordable, eco-friendly menstrual health products to rural Rwanda*** **Sustainable Health Ventures, Ltd.** Implementation Country: Rwanda CDN$1,000,000

Funding from Grand Challenges Canada will enable Sustainable Health Ventures to empower an estimated 225,000 hard-to-reach rural adolescent girls in Rwanda with high-quality menstrual pads and to educate 7,300 adolescents at more than 100 schools about menstrual health within 3 years.

A survey from Sustainable Health Ventures says 18 percent of women and girls in Rwanda miss out on school and work each year because they cannot afford to buy menstrual pads. Sustainable Health Ventures empowers women and girls to live more productive lives by manufacturing and distributing affordable menstrual pads, coupled with menstrual health education and advocacy.

Developed with earlier funding from Grand Challenges Canada, Sustainable Health Ventures' patented process converts locally-available banana fibers into the absorbent core of disposable menstrual pads without the use of chemicals. The pads are sold at an affordable price-point to women and to schools where they can be given to girls who need them. 

Complementing the product is a comprehensive menstrual health curriculum designed to debunk myths and taboos about menstruation in schools and nationwide, developed and delivered in partnership with the Rwandan Ministries of Health and Education. The curriculum is designed to be integrated into existing national training for teachers and community health workers, maximizing its impact on hard-to-reach adolescent girls.

Johnson & Johnson, a key project partner, is helping Sustainable Health Ventures shift from manual to semi-automated pad production process, reducing production costs and laying the foundation for expansion to other low- and middle-income countries. Other partners include Vitol Foundation, PIMCO Foundation, Serena Foundation, and additional individual and corporate donors. 

***Bold Idea for Girls: promoting sexual health and rights among women and girls in Kenyan slums*** **HOPE worldwide Kenya** Implementation Country: Kenya $135,000

With new support from Grand Challenges Canada, HOPE worldwide Kenya will seek to reduce HIV infections among 500 vulnerable adolescent girls and young women in Kenya's Mukuru and Dandora informal settlements through the Bold Idea for Girls project. 

Out-of-school girls and women aged 15 to 24 are disproportionately at risk of adolescent pregnancy, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections due to risky behaviors predisposed by poor knowledge of prevention, poverty and a lack of empowerment regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. 

HOPE worldwide Kenya's Bold Idea for Girls project, developed with earlier support from Grand Challenges Canada, reduces risky behaviors while addressing social and economic conditions -- a unique combination of HIV/STI education, gender and life skills programming, and vocational and entrepreneurial skills training.

The Bold Idea for Girls project has shown very promising results. In a pilot involving 546 girls living in Nairobi's Mukuru slum, knowledge and awareness of HIV and risky sexual behaviors and practices improved from 49 percent before the program to 98 percent after, and reported condom use increased from 13 percent to 92 percent. STI prevalence of 79 participants who volunteered for STI screening was 10 percent, compared to 32 percent among a comparable group of girls. The proportion of girls with sustainable income levels rose from 14 percent pre-program to 44 percent after. 

Financial and in-kind partners include the US Centre for Disease Control & Prevention, Plan International, Mercy Corps and Toto Health, with Wal-Mart Foundation and General Motors providing in-kind support.

Proof-of-Concept Projects

AFRICA

***Backpack ""Mobikits"" for Improved Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn & Child Health*** **Childslife International** Implementation Country: Kenya

In Africa slums and rural areas, many women learn their HIV status through antenatal and childbirth services -- but only 10 percent of women in Nairobi's Kibera slums receive antenatal care. 

This project will improve access to care among HIV-positive women and girls using mobile natal kits (""Mobikits""). These backpacks, powered by solar energy, are equipped with a computer and telemedicine apps to allow health practitioners to diagnose and treat mothers and their babies locally, increasing critical care for HIV-positive women.

Some 300 pregnant HIV-positive women and women intending to get pregnant will be enrolled. In addition to pre- and post-natal services, education sessions will be conducted on healthy pregnancy, healthy eating and nutrition, childbirth and postpartum months, including family planning, breastfeeding, maternal and infant care.

***The African HPV-Related Cancers (AHRC) Initiative: An innovative solution for cervical cancer self-screening in Kenya*** **Innovative Canadians for Change Foundation (Edmonton, Canada)** Implementation Country: Kenya

In Kenya, Edmonton-based innovators will introduce a simple new swab to empower women to self-screen for the Human papillomavirus (HPV), a precursor to cervical and other cancers. The novel approach overcomes both cost and social barriers to diagnosis in East Africa, which has the world's highest incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer.

Less than 4 percent of at-risk women in Kenya undergo screening due to a suite of barriers including access to clinics and / or personnel to interpret the samples, as well as cultural concerns with Pap smear cervical exams.

The innovation creates the possibility of self-screening using a cervicovaginal swab and a process (called droplet digital polymerase chain reaction) to detect HPV. Early tests suggest an unprecedented 92 percent sensitivity and specificity for oncogenic HPV.

Easy to perform at potentially less cost than a Pap smear, the sample can be taken at home and the swab sent in a preservative solution for lab interpretation. After a pilot study in Canada to further validate the technology, an implementation study in Nairobi will involve a laboratory created in partnership with AMREF Kenya.

***Converting banana fiber into low-cost menstrual pads for women and girls*** **Pad Heaven Initiative** Implementation Country: Kenya

Commercial menstrual pads are too expensive for many women and girls to afford in Kenya, where over 45 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. An average pack of 8 pads costs approximately US$1, significantly more than the daily income of many low-income Kenyan parents. Women and girls end up using pieces of cloths and rags to contain their flow, leading to infections which when left untreated, can be a major health risk.

Pad Heaven Initiative aims to manufacture hygienic, bio-degradable, and affordable menstrual pads using locally-produced banana fiber, and to provide them to women and girls in Kenya. Banana fiber is an environmentally-friendly alternative to the wood pulp used to make commercial sanitary pads, and is widely available in East Africa, where 20 percent of the world's supply of bananas is produced.

Pad Heaven Initiative will aim to produce 1,000 menstrual pads per day, to test the pads' acceptability in focus group sessions with women and girls, and to improve knowledge about menstrual hygiene. An estimated 30 women will gain employment in the production and distribution of the products. 

***Icebreaker: Social marketing to promote the female condom for family planning and HIV prevention*** **Predon Company Ltd.** Implementation Country: Kenya

Unwanted pregnancies among single college women 15-19 years old is increasing in Eldoret, in western Kenya, leading to unsafe abortions and other health problems. Only 36.2 percent of women and 52.9 percent of men aged 20 to 24 report condom use despite nationwide efforts to increase HIV awareness, widespread male condom distribution, and common fears of unplanned pregnancy. Girls have little control over and inadequate power to demand condom use during sex, or are shy about purchasing, obtaining and using condoms. 

Led by Predon Company, a marketing and communications agency in Kenya, the ""Icebreaker"" project will promote female condom use and HIV awareness, bundling the product and information into beauty care packages in salons frequented by young females near colleges. Through female condoms, women and girls will be empowered to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy and HIV infection. 

***Reducing adolescent pregnancy in Sierra Leone*** **IsraAID and FOCUS 1000** Implementation Country: Sierra Leone

Teenage pregnancy in Sierra Leone exceeds 25 percent, often caused by sexual and gender-based violence, prostitution or early marriage. Pregnant teens face stigma, compounded by a lack of emotional support leading to high rates of depression, anxiety, malnutrition and substance abuse. Half of all female teenage deaths are pregnancy related.

This project combines livelihood support with mental health and psychological support, delivered using mobile technology, and social outreach by ""community influencers"" dedicated to improving the reproductive health and mental well-being of pregnant teenagers, newborns and adolescent boys. Training and sensitization will be conducted by pairing social workers with traditional healers and religious leaders, who will together lead peer groups.

Text messaging will be used to gather data, educate community leaders, and provide support to pregnant teens. Support will be provided to form babysitting cooperatives and other financially sustainable livelihood programming.

***Ukweli Test Strips for Urinary Tract Infections*** **World Hope International (North Grenville, Canada)** Implementation Country: Sierra Leone

Pregnant women are vulnerable to Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where 30-50 percent of pregnant women will contract a UTI. UTIs often go undiagnosed because of barriers to testing, including cost, accessibility and social stigma. For a pregnant woman and her growing fetus, this is dangerous: an undetected UTI can spread to the kidney and bloodstream and can cause premature labor, slow intra-uterine growth, low birth weight or spontaneous abortion. 

In collaboration with Lehigh University, World Hope International will develop and study different distribution methods for the Ukweli Test Strip, a low-cost test for UTIs, in rural areas of Sierra Leone, where women currently lack an affordable tool for screening UTIs. The research will focus on finding the best entry point for test strips into the existing healthcare system to treat women quickly and decrease the risk of early labour. 

The project will partner with local hospitals, clinics, and Community Health Workers in several communities to conduct screening and referral for treatment. 

***Integrated clinic and community-based delivery of reproductive health services in Togo*** **Hope Through Health** Implementation Country: Togo

The West African nation of Togo has a maternal mortality rate of 4.5 per 1,000 live births and child (under age 5) mortality rate of 78 per 1,000 live births. 

Hope Through Health's model, developed in partnership with Togo's Ministry of Health, represents a new approach to reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care in the country, including family planning. 

The project trains and equips local women as community health workers to educate and enroll women into potentially life changing family planning programs, not only improving the availability of such programs but eliminating the barrier of clinical user fees. The project will provide ongoing mentorship and training of the community health workers in four underserved communities in northern Togo, where contraceptive prevalence is as low as 4 percent. 

***Family Planning Benefits Card Program, Uganda*** **Global Health Economics Limited** Implementation Country: Uganda

Contraceptive use has the potential to prevent about 30 percent of maternal and 10 percent of child deaths in low-income nations. Providing universal access to modern contraceptives in Uganda has the potential to be a highly cost-effective use of scarce healthcare resources, and will meet the high unmet need (34 percent in 2011) for family planning.

The Family Planning Benefits Card (FPBC) program will incentivize the uptake of family planning services among the urban poor in Kampala for young people, 18-30 years old, using trained community health workers to provide counseling and guidance and recruit participants. Developed in partnership with a local health benefits firm and corporate sponsors, the benefits card will ensure access to family planning counseling and guidance, birth control methods, devices and supplies, emergency contraception, and transportation to partner clinics.

The FPBC program will recruit and interview 200 participants throughout the duration of the program, and will also train 10 community health workers to mobilize the community. The study will employ both impact and health economic evaluation methods to measure program impact. A quasi-experimental study design with two separate pre- and post-samples to measure program effectiveness and a model based cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses will be conducted.

The FPBC program also includes a pilot, corporate sponsorship drive to test away for possible future funding and sustainability of the benefits card program. If successful, the project will expand to other urban communities, and to other groups of women with high unmet need for contraception.

***A Passion for Health: Empowering Girls and Building Healthy Communities through Agribusiness*** **KadAfrica Estate Limited** Implementation Country: Uganda

With the world's youngest population and endemic unemployment, family resources in Uganda are stretched and girls do not get the same opportunities as boys. Less than 50 percent of girls complete primary school and less than 1 percent finish secondary school in rural areas.

Education strongly affects reproductive behavior, infant mortality and attitudes on health. Highly vulnerable girls in Western Uganda commonly resort to risky behaviour, resulting in high teenage pregnancy and the highest HIV/AIDS rate nationwide.

KadAfrica offers passion fruit farming as a way to empower out-of-school girls, equipping them with knowledge, life-skills and health information. Girls become financially literate, generating through agribusiness the resources to practice family planning and educate their daughters - breaking the poverty cycle and building healthy communities.

KadAfrica provides a ready market for girls' fruit, sold to markets wholesale and for export to cover program costs. Through this integrated and sustainable approach, the project will train more than 6,000 girls and impact 30,000 community members over the next decade.

***Propelling Motherhood: Training village health team members to improve postpartum care*** **The Shanti Uganda Society (Vancouver, Canada)** Implementation Country: Uganda

In Uganda, less than 50 percent of new mothers access postpartum care, with many expressing negative perceptions around seeking care outside the home due limited access to care and lack of knowledge. 

The Propelling Motherhood project will train and hire local Village Health Team Members to conduct home postpartum visits with an estimated 480 women identified through a partnership with the Shanti Uganda Birth House and Luwero District Hospital. 

Village Health Team Members will collect and report data using a mobile technology developed for the program to improve clinical decision support, measurement and accountability. 

By training Village Health Team Members, the project aims to provide personalized home care services that work within cultural structures to overcome the barrier of negative perceptions of care outside family circles and increase access to care.

***Family planning in Afghan refugee camps: Where men make health decisions for women*** **Rose Charities (Vancouver, Canada)** Implementation Country: Afghanistan

This project serves a need identified in Afghan refugee camps for information and assistance in family planning. Afghanistan has high rates of maternal and infant mortality, particularly in refugee camps, where limited health services are combined with a lack of family planning education and counselling.

The goal of smaller families is shared by both men and women but knowledge is lacking and, by custom, men make health decisions relating to women accessing health services. The project focusses, therefore, on improving men's knowledge and attitudes, a departure from the conventional but largely unsuccessful approach of trying to reach and teach women.

Engaging men's groups in camps, this Vancouver-based project group promotes the financial and health benefits of family planning, endorsed by respected elders and imams, helping to foster attitudinal change, greater spousal dialogue, and women's access to family planning services and supplies.

The project will also aim to improve the health of mothers by reducing mortality from unwanted pregnancies, decreasing chronic anemia, improving the breastfeeding of infants, and increasing mother-infant interaction. 

***A maternal and child health app for Myanmar*** **Koe Koe Tech** Implementation Country: Myanmar

According to the United Nations Population Fund, for every 1,000 live births in Myanmar, where only one-third of deliveries are facility-based, two mothers and 62 children under age 5 die -- the worst rates in the region. Most maternal deaths are caused by treatable conditions such as bleeding and infection. Needed is greater access to information and health facilities.

This project will scale up nationwide its ""maymay"" mobile phone app (koekoetech.com/maymay), which provides access to quality information regarding pregnancy, a baby's first two years, nutrition and other topics, access to 10,000 doctors and midwives for advice, facilitates the setup of appointments, and ratings of medical personnel. 

The new funding will enable more content to be added, including family planning, gender-based violence services, infectious disease prevention, and health Key Performance Indicator reporting. The app will be sustainable via ad revenues and doctor referral fees.

The University of Sydney and UCLA experts will assess the app's impacts. 

***Advancing family planning and gender equity through peer-delivered therapy in Pakistan's urban slums*** **Child Advocacy International** Implementation Country: Pakistan

Improving the use of contraceptives is a top priority identified in Pakistan's national health plan. This project aims to improve the demand for and use of contraception in Pakistan's urban slums in Pakistan through a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach.

Accompanied by mobile phone and interactive voice-response technology, the CBT approach will use the principles of guided discovery, empathetic listening, problem solving and behavioural activation to address the misconceptions around contraception and empower women in decision making.

The project will organize and train couples to deliver the CBT-based intervention, creating networks of parents working with community health workers to form linkages with private and government family planning service providers. 

***Alleviating issues of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines*** **Sciventions (Toronto, Canada)** Implementation Country: Philippines 

In the Philippines, culture prevents discussion of sex, contributing to the highest teen pregnancy rate in Southeast Asia, growing from 6.5 percent in 1996 to 10 percent in 2013 -- with the worst rates found in rural and poor areas.

This Toronto-based project will use radio - the one medium that reaches the most remote places, even those with no electricity - broadcasting a twice weekly program in Palawan, an area southwest of Manila. The show will have three main segments: a talk show featuring interviews with health professionals, followed by questions from listeners sent via text message, then two minute information segments. 

Topics to be covered include menstruation, conception, contraception and nutrition, bringing these taboo subjects into a more open discussion. Effectiveness will be tested by surveys at the beginning of the project and after six, 12 and 15 months.

***Cervical cancer screening for factory employees in Haiti*** **Innovating Health International** Implementation Country: Haiti

Haiti lacks sufficient means to screen women of reproductive age for cervical cancer, the leading cause of female cancer-related death. It has also been shown that Haiti's working-class, such as factory workers, have the least exposure to health programs and education. 

In this project, women factory workers will self-swab to test for Human papillomavirus (HPV) with treatment if needed performed the next week by staff nurses in the factory infirmary. The model will allow women to receive cervical cancer screening and education directly where they work.

The model fosters sustainability as the private sector supports disease screening for employees and training of nurses, and is expected to create broader demand for screening services. Other expected benefits include the ability to provide adequate patient education in a community-based setting, no loss to follow up, and increased service uptake.

2367864,"Early infant diagnosis of HIV: changing lives for mothers and infants Mahabad Asanova’s first daughter was found to be living with HIV after being rushed to hospital with a high fever. For her second pregnancy, Ms Asanova had to wait 18 months before finding out that her son was HIV-negative.

By the time of her third pregnancy, however, things had changed dramatically. Within a month of her birth, Ms Asanova had been told that her daughter was HIV-negative. A revolutionary method of HIV testing of infants, dried blood spot (DBS) testing, had by then been introduced, significantly cutting the time for diagnosis.

“Waiting 18 months to know about the HIV status of my child was terrible,” Ms Asanova said. “I’m so relieved—dried blood spot testing completely changed my life.” Before DBS, children had to wait a year or more to be tested.

DBS is simple: no sophisticated equipment or invasive testing methods are needed. After a prick on the newborn’s heel, a drop of blood is collected on filter paper and dried. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing and the results are known before the infant is a month old, allowing infants living with HIV to be treated immediately with life-saving antiretroviral medicines.

“Before dried blood spot testing was widely introduced in 2013 in Kyrgyzstan, only around 15% of infants were diagnosed early,” said Edil Tilekov, HIV Programme Officer for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). “In 2017, that figure grew to nearly 90%.”

Today, HIV science and diagnostics are becoming ever-more sophisticated. UNICEF is promoting point-of-care HIV diagnostic methods for infants that would yield an HIV diagnosis a mere two hours after collecting blood.

The introduction of DBS and improved training for doctors has helped to defuse some of the stigma against people living with HIV.

“Stigma among medical staff began to decrease as antiretroviral medicines were integrated into the primary health-care system,” Elmira Narmatova, Director of the Osh Oblast AIDS Centre, said. “It became more like a chronic disease, mortality declined.”

Children who are treated early fare better and the more the medicines work, the more confident parents become. Today, in part as a result of DBS, more than 95% of children living with HIV in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, access antiretroviral therapy.

Yet pockets of resistance remain. Despite early diagnosis, not all infants receive the medicines they need. “We are interviewing parents and medical staff to find out why some parents still don’t want to give their infants antiretroviral medicines,” said Mr Tilekov.

Informal conversations already provide clues: resistance may be due to religion, to scepticism about immunization or even to urban myths.

“Although much has been done to provide parents with information and train medical staff, there is still a lack of resources and trained personnel, so some parents will slip through the net and might not be briefed properly about side-effects,” said Mr Tilekov. “So, if their infants lose weight or don’t eat well after starting antiretroviral therapy, parents blame the medicines.”

When an infant or mother is tested for HIV in Osh, the laboratory sends the results to the Osh AIDS Centre, a pleasant house set among trees in a leafy suburb, its gates open in welcome. The hallways are decorated with images of the popular Vitaminka fairy tale, a comic strip that helps health workers and parents explain to children the importance of taking their antiretroviral medicines regularly.

By providing child-friendly spaces and psychosocial support in addition to medical treatment, the centre makes parents feel welcome and encourages them to visit, pick up prescribed medication and get tested regularly.

The centre, upgraded by the Ministry of Health together with UNICEF and UNAIDS with support from the Government of the Russian Federation, now treats more than 200 children and a psychologist provides psychosocial support to children living with HIV.

Away from social pressures and among friends, parents can exchange hopes for the future and find much needed support at the centre.

Ms Asanova looks relaxed as her fingertips touch across her lap, her olive-green dress contrasting with her cream-coloured hijab. Mahabad Asanova isn’t her real name, since she still worries about stigma and discrimination beyond the centre’s walls. But she isn’t afraid anymore, even though she is now expecting another child. Whatever happens, thanks to DBS, she will no longer face painful months of waiting for a diagnosis.",4596,"HIV/Aids"

MURAMVYA, Burundi, 7 December 2017 – “I started to feel quite sick,” says 40-year-old Darlene*, describing a period in her life a few years ago. “After going to a health centre, I was referred to a hospital where I was hospitalized for several weeks. I did not know why I was weak, until they asked me to do HIV test. I was diagnosed as living with HIV,” she says.

At the time, Darlene was married to a man she did not trust. “I met him in the capital city of Bujumbura years ago. After finding out I was HIV positive in 2011, I asked him to do the test as well, but he refused,” she says. “I insisted many times, but it wasn’t until two years after my positive test that he also started not feeling well. Finally, he did the test. He was also positive.’’

Darlene is now divorced and lives with her five children in Bukeye, in central-western Burundi, where she farms to feed her family. Despite her illness and the difficulties of taking medication, she says she has a normal life. Her story is similar to many mothers in Burundi who have been unknowingly infected with HIV. 

**Preventing transmission from mother to child**

In Burundi, the 2016 HIV prevalence among adults aged 15 to 49 was 1.1 per cent. According to UNAIDS, in the year 2016, 2,900 people died due to the virus, and there were still 84,000 people living with HIV, of whom over 12,000 were children aged 0 to 14.

Discrimination and stigmatization, particularly among male partners and families, not using contraceptives and inappropriate breastfeeding techniques are still major challenges that UNICEF and partners are addressing. Everything starts from emphasizing the importance of protecting women from HIV.

Sister Sévera Niyimbona is in charge of a health centre run by UNICEF partner Caritas, where she has been working for the past 7 years. “Lack of knowledge and sensitization is our big adversary. Mothers don’t know that they should come to the prenatal consultation to be checked during the first three months of pregnancy,” she says. “After it can be too late.”

In 2010, the centre established a prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme to help reduce the spread of the disease. Now the centre provides drugs, counselling and psycho-social support to help mothers safeguard their children against the virus.

Interventions like the PMTCT programme have helped change the situation of HIV and AIDS in the country. Since 2010, new HIV infections have decreased by 50 per cent and AIDS-related deaths have decreased by 55 per cent.

**Securing a brighter future for her children**

After finding out that she was HIV-positive, Darlene realized that there was a serious possibility of passing the virus on to her baby during pregnancy. She went to the health centre in Bukeye and decided to enter in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme when she was pregnant with her fourth child. The UNICEF-supported programme is considered as an essential step to ensuring an AIDS-free generation in Burundi, and has already helped many mothers make sure that none of their children is born with HIV.

Not only is the programme ensuring that Darlene receives the proper medication and care to lead a healthy life, it also connects her to other HIV-positive mothers. “Mothers like me get together to share our experiences with other communities, and to move forward every day. With them and my family, I don’t feel alone,” she says.

Today Darlene is in good health. She smiles proudly while talking about her children who were protected from being infected by the virus. She recently brought her children to the health centre in Bukeye to do the test. “My last child developed a tumour and I was very scared. I thought that it was due to the virus. However, we followed all the processes of PMTCT until the last test. This was 18 months after giving birth and my child was confirmed not positive,” she says.

“Thanks to the tests and the prevention treatments in the health centre, all my children are HIV-negative and they also have a future ahead of them. I want a future for them with the same opportunities as everyone else,” she says.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2365434,"UN Migration Agency, UNAIDS Renew Partnership Giving Migrants and Crisis-affected Populations Access to HIV Services Geneva – IOM, the UN Migration Agency, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) today (08/12) signed a new cooperation agreement to ensure access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services for migrant and mobile populations as well as people affected by humanitarian emergencies.

“Migrants and mobile populations are exposed to a unique set of factors that render them more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, including limited access to health services and information as well as exposure to environments that are conducive to engaging in high-risk behaviour,” said IOM Director General William Lacy Swing. “In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of ‘leaving no one behind’, and to meet the Universal Health Coverage targets set therein, it is crucial that the rights of migrants to health be realized and effected through evidence-based, whole-of-government and cross-sector approaches, and IOM will continue to work closely with UNAIDS and other actors in jointly addressing these issues,"" added DG Swing.

“Migrant and refugee populations face many challenges which can make them more vulnerable to HIV,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “Migrant and refugee populations must be supported and enabled to exercise their right to health which is why we are strengthening our partnership with IOM to ensure they are not left behind.” 

Under the new agreement, IOM and UNAIDS will encourage States to address the vulnerabilities to HIV and the specific health care needs experienced by migrant and mobile populations, as well as by refugees and crisis-affected populations. States will be encouraged to take steps to reduce stigma, discrimination and violence, as well as to review policies related to restrictions on entry based on HIV status, with a view to eliminating such restrictions, as well as the return of people based on their status, and to support their access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support.

IOM and UNAIDS will also promote access to tailored comprehensive HIV prevention services for all women and adolescent girls, migrants and key populations and look at ways of addressing sexual and gender-based violence by working to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health-care services.

IOM and UNAIDS have a long-standing partnership, formalized in 1999. IOM is part of the UN Joint Team on HIV/AIDS at the country level and its HIV and population mobility programme complements the work of UNAIDS globally.  
During the 108th session of IOM Council, UNAIDS was granted Observer status by IOM, a sign of strengthened cooperation between the two institutions.

2365204,"Global Fund, ADB Sign MOU to Help Countries in Asia Strengthen Health Systems to Fight HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria NAY PYI TAW, Myanmar – The Global Fund and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a memorandum of understanding to support the financing, design and implementation of country-led programs to fight HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and build resilient health systems in ADB member countries eligible for Global Fund financing.

Through a framework of mutual cooperation, ADB and the Global Fund can complement each other’s contributions to health programs in the Asia and Pacific region.

“The agreement exemplifies the Global Fund’s commitment to strategic partnerships with multilateral development banks,” said Marijke Wijnroks, Interim Executive Director of the Global Fund. “Development finance institutions like ADB can augment the impact and footprint of Global Fund grants by leveraging additional investment, building financial sustainability, and reinforcing transparency.”

In countries transitioning from Global Fund grants, ADB can support a gradual shift to other funding sources, especially increased domestic financing.

“The Global Fund and ADB are building on five years of collaboration through the Regional Malaria and Communicable Diseases Threats Trust Fund,” said Diwakar Gupta, ADB Vice-President for Private Sector and Cofinancing Operations. “The Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance, for example, is working closely with Global Fund partners to improve supply chain, financial management, and program quality related to malaria. In addition to supporting the malaria elimination goal, we are working together to build attractive financing mechanisms for health system strengthening in ADB member countries.”

For the period 2017-2020, the Global Fund has allocated over $2 billion to countries in Asia and the Pacific. ADB’s Strategy 2020 is committed to expanding health sector investments to 3-5 percent of the bank’s total operations, equaling $1 billion of investment in health by 2020.

*About ADB*

ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members —48 from the region.

USAID supports regional institutions, including the East African Community (EAC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and their member states to address issues that require collaboration between countries.

**PROMOTING REGIONAL TRADE**: USAID is reducing barriers to trade with and within East Africa by improving the efficiency and transparency of cross-border transactions, harmonizing safety and quality standards and reducing the time and cost of doing business in the region. Through greater investment and trade opportunities, our programs are advancing the interests of African entrepreneurship and the private sector, as well as its American counterparts.

**ENHANCING REGIONAL FOOD SECURITY AND RESILIENCE**: By strengthening the ability of regional organizations to deliver on their mandate, USAID is helping safe, quality food move quickly and freely throughout the region. These investments also support research to address major agricultural threats such as aflatoxin and maize lethal necrosis, and help communities withstand cycles of drought without needing to rely on humanitarian assistance.

**BRINGING POWER TO AFRICA**: USAID works with national governments and regional organizations to develop and improve power infrastructure, such as power plants and grids, and create the policies and regulatory frameworks necessary to fully utilize the region’s substantial renewable energy resources.

**IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF EAST AFRICANS**: USAID helps marginalized and at-risk communities living and working in border areas and transit corridors access quality health services, with a focus on HIV, polio, and tuberculosis prevention and treatment. Our efforts also bring together environmental, public health, veterinary and wildlife experts to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases of animal origin before they escalate into costly epidemics.

**REDUCING CONFLICT AND SUPPORTING PEACE**: Frequent and often deadly conflict between communities across borders – especially between Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda – contributes to the instability of the region. To prevent conflicts from turning violent, USAID supports a regional early warning system linked to community groups and governments from all sides of the conflict, in efforts to lead an early, effective and united response.

**CONSERVING AND PROTECTING NATURAL RESOURCES**: USAID facilitates collaboration between countries to manage shared natural resources that support the livelihoods of millions of people throughout the region. Our programs also empower communities, businesses and governments with information and tools to integrate conservation into daily routines, operations and national planning.  

**PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE**: Through the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace, USAID responds to humanitarian needs across the region. These efforts include the distribution of emergency relief commodities; interventions to increase access to critical health, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene services; and the provision of protection assistance, among other activities.

2361639,"HIV/AIDS: Framework for action in the WHO African Region, 2016-2020 **Executive Summary**

HIV/AIDS continues to be a major public health concern in the African Region with almost 26 million people living with HIV and accounting for 70% of all AIDS-related deaths in the world. While there has been a decline in the number of new HIV infections, prevalence in the Region remains unacceptably high, estimated at 4.8% in 2014 but much higher in Eastern and Southern Africa ranging from 5.3% in Kenya to 27.7% in Swaziland.

Considerable progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS with the African Region having achieved the HIV targets of Millennium Development Goal 6. New HIV infections have declined by 41% since 2000 and more than 11 million people living with HIV are receiving HIV treatment which has contributed to a reduction of up to 48% in deaths due to HIV since 2005.

Despite major progress, the response is heavily funded by external resources with inadequate domestic financing, the current coverage of services is inadequate and the rate of expansion is too slow to achieve regional targets. The HIV incidence continues to increase in some countries especially among adolescent girls and young women. The declines in HIV-related deaths due to treatment are being challenged by increasing morbidity and mortality associated with co-infections, such as tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. Stigmatization and discrimination continue to hinder access to health services, particularly for children, adolescents, young women and key populations such as sex workers. In addition, many countries will need to transition to domestic funding of their HIV programmes in view of the changing donor priorities.

In recognition of the persistent challenges, a new WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV/AIDS was adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2016. The proposed framework aims at guiding the Member States in the African Region to implement the Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV, 2016 - 2021. It describes actions to accelerate HIV prevention and treatment interventions in the African Region towards ending the AIDS epidemic.

The actions proposed include prioritizing HIV prevention, expanding HIV testing services using diversified approaches and scaling up antiretroviral therapy by adopting innovative service delivery models.

The Regional Committee examined and adopted this framework.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2361394,"280,000 living with HIV/AIDS in Angola Luanda - Nearly 280,000 people are infected with HIV/AIDS virus in the country, said the Health minister Silvia Lutucuta on Friday.

The minister, who quoted the Multiple Indicators and Health Survey (2015/2016IIMS), was addressing a central event to mark the World Aids Day.

Silvia Lutucuta put the current HIV prevalence at 02 percent.

The cumulative number of people treated with antiretroviral drugs from 2014 to December 2016 is 69,841,  with antiretroviral drug coverage at 22 percent.

The minister also reiterated the country’s commitment to the global goal of eliminating AIDS epidemics by the year 2030.

She also spoke of UNAIDS intermediate targets by 2020, 90/90/90, ie to diagnose 90 percent of people with HIV.

This means to have 90% of people diagnosed with ART and 90% of people with ART have a suppressed viral load.

The official stressed that the international recommendations aims at encouraging the work on communities especially in times of scarce resources, giving priority to actions for the diagnosis of those who are most vulnerable to the infection and make use of new strategies for specific groups.

The document stresses that there are still large gaps in prevention, coupled with the overall decrease in donour financial resources.

The event gathered officials of Health Ministry, National Institute to Fight against AIDS, ANASO, UN representative in Angola, activist, UNAIDS, and other guests.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2361244,"World AIDS Day in South Sudan heightens campaigns to end AIDS by 2030 Juba, 1 December 2017:  With the theme “Right to Health”. ‘Everyone with the Right to Realize the highest attainable standard of Health without Stigma and Discrimination’, the national commemoration of the World Aida Day was officiated by H.E the Vice President, James Wani Igga on 1 December 2017 at Nyakuron Cultural Center in Juba.

To mark the day, national and state commemorative events spanned over the whole week and included HIV testing and counseling at different sites including government facilities, private clinics, community programmes, internally displaced persons (IDP) and Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites. Other activities marking the event included radio talk shows, debates in schools, marathon race led by UNMISS and which culminated into a high level advocacy workshop by parliamentarians. The event was organized to increase awareness about HIV prevention, promote HIV testing, HIV treatment and prevention, ensure zero discrimination as well as provide services and promote universal health coverage aiming at reaching everyone. 

The commemoration brought together community members, residents, government officials, civil society, Faith-Based organizations, UN staff and officials, in-school children, youth, celebrities, private sectors, academia and the media, among others participated in the commemorative event across the country.

South Sudan is among the countries in the African region implementing ‘Treat All’ recommendations among adults and adolescents in more than 50% of treatment sites in the country. This is an important step in the fight to end AIDS by 2030.

Approximately 80% of people living with HIV in South Sudan are still unaware of their HIV status. To achieve universal access to HIV treatment and care and ending AIDS as a public health threat, WHO encourages universal access to knowledge of HIV status.

‘No one has to die of AIDS’ said Dr Moses Mogga, a Clinician at Evidence Based private clinic in Juba. To end AIDS we need to educate the mass especially the youth about the free testing and treatment services that are in place, Dr Mogga added.

In commemorating the World AIDS Day 2017, linked to the overall theme “Right to Health”, the World Health Organization (WHO) focuses on achieving universal health coverage (UHC) for all 36.7 million people living with HIV and for those who are vulnerable and affected by the epidemic.

To ensure universal HIV coverage, it is important not to leave anyone behind including vulnerable populations, key populations including sex workers and people who use drugs, young women, adolescents and displaced populations who continue to face barriers to accessing HIV and other health services said Dr Moses Mutebi Nganda, Medical Officer for HIV/AIDS.

Using a slogan ‘Everybody Counts’, WHO is advocating for access to safe, effective, quality and affordable HIV services, medicines, diagnostics other health commodities for all people who need them. Universal health coverage means that all people receive the health services they need without experiencing financial hardship, including access to the full range of HIV services.

On this World Aids Day, I am also resonating the remarks of the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. In the message, Dr Moeti called on Member States to put the health and human rights of people living with HIV at the center of the response, to ensure that we reach all communities that are being left behind, said Mr Evans Liyosi, WHO Representative a.i. for South Sudan.

2361189,"Stock situation for antiretroviral drugs in Uganda Kampala – 4/12/2017 - The Ministry of Health would like to inform the public that contrary to the information that has been making rounds in the press and some public fora, the Country has adequate stocks of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to manage all the patients on treatment in Uganda.

Stakeholders and patients countrywide should be reassured that there are the right quantities of ARV drug formulations for patients to continue their treatment without any interruptions.

The Ministry of Health operates a dual track supply chain for ARVs involving two large sectors namely the public sector represented by Government (Public Health Facilities) which are supplied through the National Medical stores (NMS); and the private sector represented by the Private Not for Profit (PNFP), and Private for Profit (PFP) health facilities supplied through the Joint Medical Store (JMS) and Medical Access Uganda Limited (MAUL).

Over two-thirds of patients in Uganda are supplied through the public sector supply chain through the National Medical Stores. The public sector commodities are primarily funded by the Government of Uganda and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria. The Private Sector commodities on the other hand, are funded by the US Government through the PEPFAR program. However, In the last two years, the United States Government through PEPFAR have provided some resources to bridge gaps in the public sector ARV supplies.

During the month of September, the quantity of second line and some pediatric ARV formulations for the public sector, fell below the acceptable buffer stock of 4 months. This was a result of some delays in the delivery of some of the ARV orders.

As a result of this, we had to rationalize drug usage in the health facilities. This meant that instead of prescribing the normal two months of drug refills, health workers reduced the refill period to one month. The Ministry of Health also worked with District Health Teams and Implementing Partners to redistribute stock among facilities in consideration of their stock levels.

Ministry of Health, hereby informs the public that the pending deliveries of the affected second line and pediatric ARV formulations for the public sector have now arrived in the Country.

NMS is in the process of distributing these commodities with prioritization of the Districts and Health facilities that were most affected by the rationalization. For the first line formulations, the stock levels in the public sector have been and remain normal and stable. The situation for all commodities (First line and second line) for commodities in the private sector supply chain are normal and stable.

In the same vein, the Ministry of Health would like to clarify that contrary to claims by a section of AIDS advocates, no funds meant for the procurement of ARVs were diverted to pay for other commodities that are not ARVs. In fact, any additional funds such as from the programming of other activities are allocated to procurement of ARVs. For instance, in the current Global Fund grant, United States Dollars 19million was reprogrammed to procure ARVs to bridge the public sector gap.

Isolated stock outs of some ARVs found in health facilities should be reported to our call center on toll free line 0800-100-066 for proper follow-up.

Ministry of Health appreciates the partners who provide resources for the procurement and delivery of these important lifesaving drugs. We appreciate the contribution of the United States Government through PEPFAR, the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria and the Government of Uganda for these efforts.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2359654,"Step Up the Pace: Towards an AIDS-free generation in West and Central Africa ABIDJAN/DAKAR/NEW YORK/GENEVA, 5 December 2017 – More than four decades into the HIV epidemic, four in five children living with HIV in West and Central Africa are still not receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy, and AIDS-related deaths among adolescents aged 15-19 are on the rise, according to a new report released today.

While acknowledging progress in several areas, the report Step Up the Pace: Towards an AIDS-free generation in West and Central Africa, jointly published by UNICEF and UNAIDS, shows that West and Central Africa is lagging behind on nearly every measure of HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes for children and adolescents. In 2016, an estimated 60,000 children were newly infected with HIV in West and Central Africa.

“It is tragic that so many children and adolescents today are not receiving the treatment they need just because they have not been tested,” said Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF’s West and Central Africa Regional Director. “We need to make better use of innovations to increase early diagnosis and improve access to HIV treatment and care for children. For example, the point-of-care technology diagnostic brings testing closer to where children attend health services and self-testing can be a good option for adolescents who may be more comfortable with it.”

The region’s coverage of life-saving antiretroviral therapy among children living with HIV is the lowest in the world because many countries have limited capacity to perform the tests needed for early infant diagnosis of HIV. Without knowing a child’s HIV status, his or her family is less likely to seek the treatment that could prevent the tragedy of a child’s death from AIDS-related illnesses.

The situation is worse among adolescents. The annual number of new HIV infections among those aged 15–19 years in the region now exceeds that of children aged 0-14 years. These new infections occur mostly through unprotected sexual contact and among adolescent girls. Equally concerning, according to the report, is that West and Central Africa has recorded a 35 per cent increase in the annual number of AIDS-related deaths among adolescents aged 15-19 years — the only age group in which the number of AIDS-related deaths increased between 2010 and 2016.

With the region’s youth population expected to grow significantly within the coming decades, especially in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, the numbers of children and adolescents becoming infected with HIV and dying from AIDS is likely to remain high, unless the HIV response – both prevention and treatment – improves dramatically.

The report highlights that the 24 countries that make up the West and Central Africa region are home to 25 per cent of children aged 0–14 years living with HIV worldwide.

“Leaders of the region have endorsed a Catch-Up plan aiming to triple the number of people on treatment in the region – including children – by the end of 2018, the key issue now is to accelerate implementation,” said Luiz Loures, UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director. “Countries should urgently put in place more effective strategies for early infant diagnosis of HIV, and start reducing inequity in children’s access to treatment.”

The report proposes key strategies that will enable countries to accelerate progress in curbing the spread of disease. These include:

1. A differentiated HIV response focusing on unique epidemiological and local contexts in each country and community.  
2. The integration of HIV services into key social services including health, education and protection.  
3. Community ownership and local governance of the HIV response including working with families, better placed to help reduce stigma, access prevention and treatment.  
4. Investment in innovations to remove barriers to scale-up including new diagnostic and biomedical approaches such as point of care diagnostics, HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis.

UNICEF announced last week that at the current pace of progress, the global 2020 Super-Fast-Track targets to end AIDS among children will not be achieved.

**Key facts from the report**

- Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV coverage has increased 2.5-fold between 2010 and 2016 (from 21 per cent to 49 per cent), with some countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso and Cabo Verde now providing these services to more than 80 per cent of the pregnant women living with HIV.  
- West and Central Africa has the lowest paediatric antiretroviral treatment coverage in the world, with only 21 per cent of the 540,000 children (0-14) living with HIV receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2016 – compared to 43 per cent globally.  
- Today, West and Central Africa accounts for 37 per cent of the world’s AIDS-related deaths among children: about 43,000 AIDS-related deaths occurred among children in West and Central Africa in 2016, a decrease of 31 per cent compared to 2010.  
- There were 62,000 adolescents (15-19) newly infected with HIV in 2016, unchanged compared to 2010.  
- Adolescent girls and young women continue to be the most affected, with women making up nearly three out of five of all adolescents aged 10-19 years living with HIV across West and Central Africa.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2359409,"Dr Moeti calls for greater commitment to access, diagnosis and treatment for children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS 03 December 2017 - At the margins of the ICASA 2017, the WHO Regional office for Africa in collaboration with the WHO headquarters and Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) as well as other members of the AIDS FREE working group (UNICEF, PEPFAR, CIFF, ELMA) gathered in Abidjan. With the participation of delegations from the 21 priorities countries, they assessed progress, identified remaining gaps and shared good practices for accelerating efforts to scale up timely diagnosis and treatment for children and adolescents living with HIV.

“Indeed, we have made remarkable progress. This progress is a result of meaningful community engagement, increased knowledge of HIV status of our population and strong leadership, ownership and commitment from governments and partners. However, considerable gaps remain. We have to invest more in HIV services that will reach populations and locations in greatest need. In order to achieve the targets we set ourselves to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Agenda, we have to address the big challenges head-on,"" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.
 
In sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of HIV among children and adolescents remains high despite scale-up of interventions to reduce mother-to-child transmission and improvements in access to care and treatment for children and adolescents living with HIV. In 2016 there are still 2.1 million children living with HIV globally, with 88% residing in sub-Saharan Africa. 84% of global AIDS-related deaths among children (aged 0-15) occurred in the African region.  An estimated 250,000 adolescents aged 10-19 years were newly infected with HIV in 2015 and 68% of these occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.
“These children have the right to access the best and most effective treatment” said Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO Director of Department of HIV and Global Hepatitis Programme.

There is growing recognition of the inequity in progress towards the global goals of the AIDS response as it relates to children and adolescents. Despite an increase in treatment coverages for children since 2010, the coverage gap remains with only 43% of children getting antiretroviral therapy treatment.
“One organization cannot win the fight against HIV alone. It is through partnership that we will achieve an AIDS-free generations.” Said Dr Robalo, Director of WHO AFRO Communicable Disease Cluster.

The AIDS FREE working group has the goal of supporting and tracking acceleration to timely identify and treat children and adolescents living with HIV to reach the targets of treating of 1.6 million children and 1.2 million adolescents by 2018 as well as 1.4 million children and 1 million adolescents by 2020. Within the Start Free, Stay Free, AIDS Free framework WHO and partners continues to work to ensure the provision of technical assistance to adapt and adopt WHO recommendations, and to introduce novel innovations to scale up testing, treatment, and care for children.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2359374,"Turning The Tide In The Fight Against HIV/AIDS Approximately 36.7 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2016). Of these, 2.1 million are children. In 2016, an estimated 1.8 million individuals became newly infected with HIV, which equates to 5,000 new infections per day. 

Although there was a decline in the HIV death rate between 2000 and 2015, African regions still account for almost two-thirds of the global total of new HIV infections. Africa is home to 25.6 million people with HIV (WHO, 2016). 

Zimbabwe is one of the African countries that continues to have a large amount of its population living with HIV, an estimated 13 million people. Due to access to antiretroviral treatment, the life expectancy in Zimbabwe has reached 61 years in 2015 compared to 41 years in 2003. In 2016, more than 49,000 deaths were averted comprising 393,000 prevented deaths since 2006. 

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) played a vital role in supporting countries most affected by the HIV epidemic by providing access to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria resources. Most recently US $502 million have been approved to support HIV, tuberculosis and malaria programmes in Zimbabwe during the next three years. 

In Kenya, there are around 1.5 million people living with HIV, 400 000 of whom are unaware that they have the virus. In May 2017, the Government of Kenya has launched two innovative technologies to address low testing rates, especially among men, and bring ending the AIDS epidemic: self-testing for HIV and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), an antiretroviral medicine, to prevent HIV infection. 

The Be Self Sure campaign aimed to encourage people to get tested for HIV. As part of the campaign, the HIV self-test kits were made available through public and private health facilities.

*“With the launch, Kenya becomes the first country to undertake a national roll-out of HIV self-testing and the second in Africa to bring to scale pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of HIV infection for those at high risk.”* - Jackson Kioko, Director Of Medical Services, Ministry Of Health, Kenya

UNAIDS is working to prevent new HIV infections and to ensure that by 2020, 90% of Kenyans living with HIV know their status and 90% of people who know their HIV-positive status are accessing treatment. By achieving these targets, Kenya will be able to end its AIDS epidemic by 2030.

In Paris, doctors have announced a new generation cancer drug which might be an antidote for those living with HIV. The study has found that the drug, nivolumab, was able to reduce the amount of dormant HIV cells in the body thus improving patient’s immune response. 

While advances in medicine and technology are changing the course of life-threatening diseases such as HIV/AIDS in Africa, many people continue to face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, including stigma, lack of awareness and funding. Public awareness campaigns and measures to improve testing rates and encourage treatment need to continue in order to prevent the disease spreading further. Ending HIV/AIDFS needs social not just medical breakthroughs and the governments must strengthen the healthcare systems and mechanisms to ensure that everyone has access to required health services and medicine.

The Aid & International Development Forum (AIDF) is hosting the 3rd annual[ Aid & Development Africa Summit](http://africa.aidforum.org/) on 27-28 February 2018 in Nairobi to share latest innovations and best practice in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases in East Africa. 

Expert speakers including Matthias Boyen, UAV Focal Point - HIV/AIDS Support Project Officer at UNICEF, Gary Jones, Security AIDS & Humanitarian Response Advisor at UNAIDS and Olawale Maiyegun, Director, Department of Social Affairs at African Union Commission will provide an update on regional health programmes and share ways to scale up HIV treatment and enable access to crucial health care services in the region.

2359219,"Strategic Framework for the Elimination of new HIV infections among children in Africa by 2015 Executive Summary 

In 2009, an estimated 400 000 children were newly infected with HIV, with 90% of infections occurring in children in sub-Saharan Africa through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). Without any intervention, the risk of MTCT ranges from 20% to 45%; without any treatment, half of the babies will die before their second birthday. About 42 000 to 60 000 of pregnant women die from HIV. In contrast, in high-income countries, the number of new infections among children as well as the number of maternal and child deaths due to HIV are virtually zero.  

It is possible to stop new HIV infections among children and keep their mothers alive if pregnant women living with HIV and their children have timely access to quality lifesaving antiretroviral drugs for their own health, as indicated, or as prophylaxis to stop HIV transmission during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. When antiretroviral drugs are available as prophylaxis, mother-to-child transmission of HIV can be reduced to less than 5%. There is an urgent call for action by global and regional bodies as well as governments for the elimination of new HIV infections among children by 2015; this includes keeping mothers alive as well as sustaining children who are living with HIV.  

With the vision of a generation alive and free of HIV and syphilis, the goal of this African regional framework is to eliminate new HIV infections among children by 2015 and keep their mothers alive. This framework outlines the aim, objectives, targets and priority actions for eliminating new HIV and syphilis infections in children in the African Region by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive. The framework is designed to provide countries in the Region with a systematic approach to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) based on country typology (epidemiology and response) and improvement of maternal and child health and survival in the context of HIV/AIDS. The two targets to be achieved by 2015 are to reduce the number of new HIV infections among children by 90% from the 2009 baseline, and to reduce the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths by 50%.  

The proposed priority actions for the EMTCT initiative are based on the following seven building blocks for accelerated actions: (i) ensure leadership and country ownership; (ii) improve coverage, access and utilization of services; (iii) strengthen quality of MNCH services to deliver effective PMTCT interventions; (iv) enhance provision of linked services; (v) strengthen human resource capacity, supply chain management and maintain information systems; (vi) improve measurement of performance and impact; and (vii) develop and engage community systems.  

Monitoring and evaluation will be in line with the Global Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and Strategy for the Global Plan Towards the elimination of new HIV Infections by 2015. This Strategic Framework also relies on the global, regional and country milestones of Countdown to Zero: Global Plan towards elimination of new HIV infections among children by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive, 2011–2015. Clear targets, indicators, milestones, roles and responsibilities have been defined with the priority being measurements of progress linked to maternal, newborn and child health.  

There is global and regional consensus for elimination of new HIV infections in children and keeping mothers alive, as well as support for linking these efforts with those aimed at eliminating congenital syphilis, given the similar modes of infection transmission and prevention interventions. Countries will require support to implement effective interventions for elimination of MTCT of both HIV and syphilis to ensure universal coverage which is cost-effective and sustainable. It is also vital to have adequate resources, empowerment of communities, and empowerment of women living with HIV to access the HIV prevention, treatment and care that they need for themselves, their children and their families. It is critical to ensure partner involvement while observing and respecting the rights of women living with HIV.

National and global leaders must act in concert to support country-driven efforts, accept joint accountability for delivering results, and ensure integration with other key efforts to improve MNCH services. This framework is a road map for accelerated action to enable each country in this Region, regardless of context or circumstances, to take concrete steps towards eliminating new HIV and syphilis infections among children and keeping their mothers alive.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2358579,"Reducing infant mortality by caring for seropositive mothers *by Cynthia Kanyere*

TESTIMONY – HIV infection is still little known in some parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Seropositive women ignore their serological status, and transmit HIV to their newborns who sometimes die before their 1st birthday. Thanks to appropriate care, Josephine, 38 and seropositive, has brought her two seronegative children to the world who are in good health today. Let’s discover her story.

**An ignorance that kills**

“I was married in 1997. During nine years of marriage, I had two miscarriages and my first four children died before their 1st birthday. I lived in Bunagana with my husband. I learnt that women were being cared for at the Rugari health centre (around 25 km from Bunagana). I took the risk to travel because I really wished to have a child in good health.

When I was told that I am seropositive, I felt crushed, horrible. I was told that it was HIV that was killing my children. I returned home to Bunagana. I didn’t say anything to my husband because I was so scared of his reaction. A few months later, I fell pregnant. I did not have the choice but to return to Rugari. The nurse told me that if I go to prenatal consultations (PNC) at the start of the pregnancy, we could save my child from HIV. I travelled each month to come to the PNC and take my antiretroviral medication here in Rugari. During this time, after learning that I was seropositive, my husband left me. In the third trimester of my pregnancy, I moved to Bunagana to come live here in Rugari and be close to the health centre.

**My first child, born without HIV**

It is thanks to the treatment I received that my child was born without HIV. I breastfed him exclusively for six months, after which I weaned him off. It was what I was advised to do. He has grown in good health. My husband returned after learning that our child was in good health. Two years after, my second child was born. He is also seronegative. Today, they are 10 and 8 years old.
My husband never agreed to do the HIV test. He has unfortunately passed away.

I am grateful for everything that has been done for my children and me. The counselling helped me to accept myself; I receive the medication for free. I appear like any other healthy person.
I have lost many children because I did not know about my serological status. But today, thanks to the right care, my two children are alive and in good health.”

**Prenatal consultations for couples to detect HIV**

Since 2004, in the territory of Rushuru, North-Kivu, the Rugari health centre started a programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, with the support of UNICEF. A pregnant woman goes to prenatal consultations each month for the monitoring of her pregnancy, and receives the appropriate vaccines and medication that protect the child in her womb. Since 2011, the prenatal consultation approach for couples has been established in order to take better care of couples, especially in cases involving HIV.

“Pregnant women have understood the benefit of taking the HIV test from the first trimester of their pregnancy. At the start of this project, the men did not accompany their wives to prenatal consultations. But since we expected the father to be present in order to welcome the pregnant women to the PNC, the men accompany their wives and also agree to take the HIV test,” declared Séverine Masika, in charge of the MTCT Programme at the Rugari health centre.

The grant aligns with the mission and commitment of both organizations to build and improve the infrastructure of communities beginning with prenatal care. It will enable Episcopal Relief & Development and a local partner, Zambia Anglican Council Outreach Programmes (ZACOP), to impact approximately 17,520 children under the age of three, many of whom are impacted by HIV/AIDS.

“We are very grateful for this partnership and the generosity of the Episcopal Health Foundation,” said Robert W. Radtke, President of Episcopal Relief & Development. “Together, we have an opportunity to make an even greater impact on the lives of so many vulnerable children and their families.”

The support from the Episcopal Health Foundation contributes to the program’s expansion to all five Anglican dioceses in Zambia. The program currently works with approximately 12,720 children under the age of three along with 6,360 primary parents and caregivers in 53 communities in rural Zambia. It also enables the program to include an additional 4,800 children and 2,400 primary caregivers and parents in 20 new ECD centers. Each center serves as a hub for 240 children and 120 primary caregivers/parents.

""Episcopal Relief & Development’s Early Childhood Development program has shown success in increasing primary caregivers’ nurturing care and in strengthening their connections to services,” said Katy Butterwick, program officer at the Episcopal Health Foundation. “This support of strong brain development is helping build a foundation for healthy lives.""

This is Episcopal Relief & Development’s second grant from the [Episcopal Health Foundation](http://www.episcopalhealth.org/en/) (EHF). In 2016, EHF supported the organization’s Integrated Child Health programs in Ghana. Based in Houston, Texas, the foundation was created in 2013 by the Episcopal Diocese of Texas with a central mission of improving the health and well-being of the 11 million people living within the diocese.

Episcopal Relief & Development’s Early Childhood Development programs focus on fighting poverty, hunger and disease in children while promoting the health, development and financial well-being of families. This partnership with EHF helps fill a gap that exists in addressing the needs of young children and their parents/primary caregivers who live in communities ravaged by poverty and HIV/AIDS. The program leverages the role of faith-based leaders in working directly with community members and impacted  families.

In an effort to step up the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS, voluntary counselling and testing was offered to mark World AIDS Day in Wau, in northwestern South Sudan. 

UN peacekeepers and health partners set up mobile voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) stations in residential and public areas around the town including the main market area.

The public was encouraged to test and people living with HIV to seek treatment to avoid complications.

The initiative was well received with scores of people showing up to get tested.

Acting Director of HIV/AIDS in Wau Teaching Hospital, Pina Paul, said that over 2,400 people affected with HIV in Wau are receiving treatment.

She said that most people receiving treatment were those internally displaced living at the UN Protection of Civilians site, Wau Cathedral and other surrounding areas.

The UNMISS HIV/AIDS Unit in Wau Field Office held peer education training for UN peacekeepers, including members of the local police and organized sport activities at the UN base to commemorate World AIDS Day. 

The Acting Head Field Office, Mustapha Tejan-Kella said there was a need to stand in unity to fight HIV/AIDS and support people living with HIV without discrimination.

“As research progresses for newer and better treatments, we should not be complacent, as HIV/AIDS is still with us,” said Mr Tejan-Kella.

Mr Tejan-Kella said that everyone has a part to play in order to achieve the 90-90-90 goal set for 2020.

The goal calls for 90 per cent of all people living with HIV to know their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection to receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression.",4596,"HIV/Aids"

2357464,"Progress against HIV/AIDS made but not yet good enough: UNMISS head *LIATILE PUTSOA*

While progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS has been made, “it is not good enough, people are still dying,” says the head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan.

Speaking at the World AIDS Day commemoration at the UN base in Juba, David Shearer, who is the Special Representative to the Secretary-General, says that while great strides have been made to test and treat people for HIV in South Sudan, there is still a lot that has to be done to combat the “disease that affects everybody, including children”.

“Let us make sure we do our bit so that we do not see new cases of AIDS and let us take the message far and wide,” said David Shearer.

The ongoing conflict in the young east African nation has made it difficult for the United Nations to provide adequate support and services to people affected and infected by HIV/AIDS.

UN AIDS Country Director, Sophia Mukasa Monico, said that only 30,000 of the 200,000 South Sudanese diagnosed with the disease are receiving treatment. She added that due to the ongoing conflict, it is possible that there are more people living with the virus but have not been tested.

During the ceremony, UN peacekeepers held a candlelight vigil as a sign of hope, peace and solidarity. A charity race, a game of volleyball, football, cricket and tug-of-peace were also held.  

Voluntary testing and counselling services were available throughout the day.

“I decided to test today to know my status and if I am positive then it is also good for me so that I can control myself,” said 39-year-old Taban Modi.

This year’s theme - Right to Health – aims to bring awareness to the fact that many people around the world, particularly people living with HIV, are being denied their right to health, which is a fundamental human right.

2357344,"HIV: Delivering differently to reach people living with HIV in West and Central Africa *This week, researchers, policy makers, clinicians and activists involved in the [HIV](http://www.msf.org/en/diseases/hivaids) response will attend ICASA2017, in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Being at the heart of West and Central Africa, there is no better place for me and my medical colleagues at MSF to call out some of the main reasons preventing millions of people in the region from getting lifesaving HIV treatment. These must be addressed for this year’s theme of ‘delivering differently’ to be realised. Otherwise, we will simply not reach the four million people in the region still undiagnosed and untreated for the disease.*

As a doctor, each person with AIDS we see arriving at hospitals in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Guinea and Central African Republic (CAR) tells a story of terrible failure: the failure of the health system to deliver life-saving antiretrovirals (ARVs) in time and without interruption.

In the West and Central African region, by the end of 2016, only 42 per cent of people living with HIV had access to testing, 35 per cent of people diagnosed were receiving lifesaving antiretrovirals, and only 25 per cent were ‘virally suppressed’. In an era of ‘test and treat all’, people are dying of AIDS. We increasingly see people who had already been on treatment, and stopped. When they come back to care, their first line treatment is likely less effective. Many face horrendous disease and death. That’s what we, as medical workers want to prevent. Because, at the end of the day, we are first accountable to those we provide medical care for, not governments or donors.

A staggering range of obstacles still stands between people living with HIV and lifesaving treatment, including pervasive stigma, legal and policy blockages, and a reluctance to include civil society and communities in improving and expanding the HIV response. Ongoing conflict in countries like CAR or parts of DRC adds further complexity.

Yet by far the most obstructive are recurrent supply issues and stock-outs of HIV commodities and the high costs faced by service users, as are dwindling levels of international funding which stand in stark contrast to political commitments made to boost the HIV response in West and Central Africa.

In DRC for instance, our staff regularly witness the impact of stock outs and shortages of drugs and diagnostics. This implies that people can’t be tested or started on treatment. Those already on treatment face the risk of developing opportunistic infections or viral resistance, which greatly reduces their chances of survival.

Many supply systems of West and Central Africa are neither flexible nor reactive to the demands of people living with HIV. Supplies frequently remain stuck at central distribution points, never actually reaching those in need. Without sufficient and regular supplies, organising longer drug refills like the [R6M model](http://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/dissemination_of_three_novel_approaches_piloted_by_msf.pdf) being piloted in Guinea will not be possible.

User fees should also be eliminated and alternatives found to prevent service users from paying at the clinic.  In several countries of the region, peoples are asked to pay for consultations, access to their files, or required tests and drugs against opportunistic infections. These payments either prevent people from starting ARVs or continuing their treatment.  Those who – avoiding treatment due to high cost – fall ill and require hospital care face catastrophic expenses.

At MSF’s AIDS centre in Kinshasa, an MSF study (2016) among health staff, caregivers and people arriving with late stage AIDS, found that payments for care and drugs was a major factor behind why they developed very advanced stages of disease and delayed seeking care . Elsewhere, in Bangui, CAR, people living with HIV recently told MSF of being charged US$2.70 for HIV testing and $9 for a month’s supply of ARVs, a fortune to most. As a result, many remain untested or once on treatment, become defeated and give up on care.

The current lack of international funding will prevent sufficient resources for key interventions in the HIV response. Resources remain far below what the region needs to achieve the agreed targets by governments. A “substantial financing gap” (according to UNAIDS) today threatens the region’s progress and might even endanger positive results obtained.

Moreover, there is much uncertainty around whether the Global Fund’s next allocation will provide enough support the needed acceleration in West and Central Africa. It is expected that most countries’ allocation will either remain at the same level as the past three years or decrease. As a result, some countries fear they will have to lower initiation rates instead of the planned acceleration, which will have drastic consequences for people living with HIV to whom – I repeat – we are accountable to.

Funding and support for civil society and associations of people living with HIV is also under threat, in spite of the wide recognition of their pivotal role in the response. In West and Central Africa particularly, this will further undermine the key role of civil society in expanding HIV testing and treatment and monitoring services.
It’s clear that without rapidly and effectively tackling these challenges, the regional Emergency catch-up agreed in July 2017 will remain nothing more than a rallying call. More importantly, people won’t receive the treatment they need, and we will continue to keep the lives of millions in West and Central Africa desperately ‘out of focus’.

**That’s why MSF is calling for the following:**

-Innovative models of care and community mobilisation that allow people living with HIV to stay healthily on treatment must be implemented, particularly in conflict areas.  
- Focused, differentiated packages of care to quickly identify and provide efficient, timely treatment for people with AIDS that helps bring them back into regular care.  
- Rapid and effective support to last mile delivery of essential medical commodities, and longer term plans to build effective and efficient supply chains should be combined with short term measures to avoid low stock levels and stock-outs. All aspects of HIV and TB care must be made ‘free of charge’, as the financial burden on people affected and their families threatens access to, retention in and quality of care.  
- Increased and sustained funding is urgently needed to implement key strategies to accelerate the HIV response in countries of West and Central Africa.",4596,"HIV/Aids"

- Market price monitoring highlights dramatic increases in food prices. In February 2017, a food basket in Juba costs five times as much as the year before.

**Situation Update**  
- In a visit to Wau on 19 April, Directors of WFP, OCHA, UNICEF and IOM urged local authorities to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian staff. This visit followed the killing of three workers contracted as porters by WFP’s office in Wau, Western Bahr El Ghazal, last week. A recent upsurge in violence starting on 10 April has displaced at least 13,500 people in Wau, according to IOM. WFP is closely monitoring the situation in order to continue its assistance to people in need.  
- Since 13 February, WFP in collaboration with IOM, has registered a total of 69,389 individuals or 15,494 households in SCOPE across seven sites in Panyijar county. To date, 318,000 individuals have been registered in WFP’s beneficiary and transfer management platform across South Sudan. This platform provides opportunities for strategic partnerships for enhanced efficiency.  
- WFP’s latest monthly market price bulletin highlights a continued weakening of the South Sudanese Pound against the US Dollar, and dramatic increases in food prices, which contribute significantly to the overall inflation rate. The price of cereals and bread increased by more than five times since February 2016. Poor households are most severely impacted by the observed inflation rates as their food baskets consists mainly of cereals. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the national inflation rate stood at 425.9 percent in February. Furthermore, insecurity along the supply routes and high transportation costs are contributing factors to the likelihood of supply reduction during the lean season. The WFP report indicates that prices of food commodities will remain at elevated levels or even to increase further as the lean season progresses.  
- This week, a one-day workshop on accountability to affected people, (AAP), Protection and Gender mainstreaming was organized for WFP staff members and WFP cooperating partners in Malakal.

2356174,"Zimbabwe: 1 million people now on HIV treatment, $502 million additional healthcare funding announced New York, 30 Nov— Zimbabwe, one of the countries most affected by the HIV epidemic, is now providing antiretroviral treatment to 1 million people living with HIV. This considerable achievement is the result of a determined effort to scale up the HIV response over the last decade and strong commitment from Government with support from development partners. Additional funding of US$502 million has been approved by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) to support HIV, tuberculosis and malaria programmes for the next three years, managed through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare.

While HIV remains a major health challenge in Zimbabwe, with 1.3 million people living with HIV at the end of 2016, the dramatic scale up of the HIV response is remarkable. Due to access to antiretroviral treatment, there have been more than 49,000 deaths averted in 2016 alone and 393,000 deaths averted since 2006 in the country. In 2005, just 12,000 people living with HIV in Zimbabwe had access to life-saving HIV treatment. The decline of life expectancy in Zimbabwe, which had reached 41 years in 2003, has also been reversed, reaching 61 years in 2015.

“As a country we have come a long way in addressing the challenge of HIV,” said the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Brigadier General Dr. Gerald Gwinji. “The one million antiretroviral treatment milestone has been a remarkable journey, thanks to the effective leadership of Government and the good partnership with our development partners. We have in a decade, managed to turn the tide in the fight against this killer disease by boosting the resilience of our health care system and ensuring that effective services are available to those most in need including people living with HIV,” he further added.

Out of the total funding, $426 million will focus on ensuring universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services, with an emphasis on eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV and ensuring prevention programmes are serving adolescents, youth and key populations at higher risk of HIV.

Bishow Parajuli, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Zimbabwe says, “Zimbabwe has made great strides in increasing access to treatment. This new milestone means that 1 million people living with HIV are now able to live longer, healthier and more productive lives. UNDP looks forward to continuing our strong partnership with the Government of Zimbabwe, the Global Fund, development partners, all components of the UN system, civil society and affected communities to help achieve SDG3 and make sure we leave no-one behind.”

UNDP plays a key role in supporting countries facing challenging circumstances to access Global Fund resources and has worked closely with the Government of Zimbabwe over the last 15 years to support the delivery of life-saving HIV services, while simultaneously helping to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health and Child Care.

December 1, World AIDS Day, is an important moment for the global health community. For the Global Fund, it’s a moment to reflect on the progress that’s been made. From scientific breakthroughs to social movements to defeat stigma and discrimination, we’ve come so far since the darkest days of the AIDS crisis.

It’s a moment to express gratitude for our partners, donors and the communities who guide our investments. The Global Fund’s existence is predicated on the trust placed in us by partners and the goodwill of people from all walks of life – people who know that human ingenuity and compassion is bigger than HIV.

And it’s a moment to renew our commitment to ending HIV, TB and malaria as epidemics. We have made incredible gains together. 22 million lives saved. Through Global Fund-supported programs, 4.2 million HIV-positive mothers received treatment to prevent transmission of the virus to their children and 11 million people are on lifesaving ARV therapy.

This impact is all thanks to partnership. One of our longest-running partnerships is with (RED), the brainchild of Bono and Bobby Shriver to harness the power of people and iconic brands to help fight AIDS.

Since (RED)’s founding in 2006, the money raised through special events and campaigns led by more than 100 private sector partners, supporters and creative collaborators has benefited the lives of 110 million people through HIV treatment, prevention, testing, counseling and care services.

And just in time for World AIDS Day, (RED) has hit a major milestone. It has generated a total of US$500 million for the Global Fund.

(RED) has leveraged transformational support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has provided matching funds for key campaigns to multiply the impact of individual and corporate donations. For the third year in a row, the Gates Foundation will be matching every dollar raised for (RED)’s SHOPATHON, up to US$15 million.

The Global Fund is grateful to (RED), its fantastic corporate, celebrity and philanthropic partners, and the countless compassionate consumers who have chosen (RED) to help fight HIV.",4596,"HIV/Aids"

Last year South Africa became the first country on the continent to register the use of a drug that could be used as an oral pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, referred to as PrEP, is the use of anti-retroviral drugs by people who do not have HIV to prevent them from becoming infected.

The idea behind PrEP has been to target high risk populations where new infections remain consistently high. This includes sex workers, men who have sex with men, injection drug users and young women.

Following a [recommendation](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/197906/1/WHO_HIV_2015.48_eng.pdf) by the World Health Organisation to use the drug as an additional HIV prevention choice South Africa registered [Tenofovir/Emtricitabine](http://www.mccza.com/documents/2e4b3a5310.11_Media_release_ARV_FDC_PrEP_Nov15_v1.pdf) last year.

By June this year South Africa’s PrEP programme was being implemented at 17 sites that were serving sex workers and men who have sex with men. The programme had also been expanded to provide the drug at nine clinics at seven tertiary institutions which serve more than 120,000 young people.

The PrEP rollout data shows that there is a relatively slow, but increasing, uptake of PrEP. There are concerns. One year after the licence was procured there are fears that the rollout isn’t sufficiently targeting one of the country’s most high risk populations: young women.

This is a critical cohort of people in the fight against new HIV infections. Studies show that young women in South Africa, aged between 15 and 24 years have the [highest HIV incidence](https://reliefweb.int/node/675771). About 1,745 new HIV infections occur among these young women every week.

An additional factor that makes the group so important in bringing down infections is that they represent a [substantial section](http://www.indexmundi.com/south_africa/demographics_profile.html) – about 10% – of the population.

Unless this problem is solved the rates of new infections in South Africa are unlikely to be reduced.

**Great idea, challenging to deliver**

After South Africa procured the licence for the HIV prevention tablet, the National Department of Health launched a national policy and set of guidelines to rollout PrEP and provide test and treat services. Test and treat allows people to access antiretrovirals as soon as they test positive.

The government’s cost-effectiveness analyses suggested that the greatest impact of PrEP would be in populations that have a substantial risk for HIV infection. As a result the policy focused initially on providing PrEP at a limited number of sex worker sites. This would help them learn more about real world delivery prior to scale up.

But here lies the issue. There is a high level of political will and desire in the government to rollout PrEP to young women who are at risk, but the health system requirements are complex. Cost is also a consideration. There is a need to establish how best to identify young women at highest risk and how best to offer and retain young women on PrEP.

**Next steps**

PrEP is new technology that has the potential to alter the HIV epidemic particularly among women. But a narrow focus on a single technology alone is unlikely to solve health and social challenges associated with HIV.

South Africa needs to pay careful attention to access and service delivery issues and constraints, and to engage communities as PrEP is scaled up so that its potential is fully realised.

There are a number of small scale research projects mainly in and around Johannesburg and Cape Town that could help inform how best to deliver PrEP to young women. More than 500 adolescent girls and young women between the ages of 16-24 years are being enrolled in the projects. The aim is to to learn more about scalable models of PrEP delivery for adolescents in countries like South Africa which has limited resources.

Without an understanding of best practices and most cost effective scalable delivery models for young women, it will be challenging for South Africa to maximise the impact of core HIV prevention, treatment, and care interventions.

Another critical step to filling the gaps would be to generate greater community awareness about PrEP. Many people don’t know that there is an antiretroviral pill that, if taken every day, can reduce a person’s risk of being infected with HIV. Getting the message across is difficult because the legacy of concerns about antiretrovirals and their side effects persist in many communities.

This is not just about awareness but about the need for a broader conversation about how we address the underlying issues that continue to shape HIV risks in young women. Stigma, violence against women, judgemental attitudes about young people having sex all make it more difficult for people to accept PrEP and to use it effectively.

A broader conversation is needed to increase knowledge and awareness of PrEP, its potential to change the course of the epidemic, and where it fits in to a broader programme of HIV prevention.",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2356014,"Progress for HIV-positive Children There has been considerable improvement in the care and treatment of children living with HIV. However, Caritas is concerned that progress is slowing down.
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to suppress HIV. ART also prevents onward transmission. Huge reductions have been seen in rates of death and infections when ART is used.
There are 2.1 million children living with HIV. 43 percent of them are receiving anti-retroviral therapy. This compares to 54 percent among adults. While there has been considerable progress in the global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy, the year-on-year increase is slowing down among children. In 2010-2011 there was a net increase of 100,000 children on ART; between 2015 and 2016 that increase was only 58,000.
Going the last mile will require innovation in diagnosing women living with HIV, ensuring they understand the value of adherence to treatment and increasing child ART coverage.
This will involve increased efforts to develop new medications for children. In contrast to the development of better ARVs for adults living with HIV over 20 years, there have been very few new medicines made available for children. Existing paediatric ARVs are often bitter tasting, difficult to administer, inappropriate for low-resource settings, and with toxic side effects for growing bodies.
The lack of suitable ARVs for children has contributed to low levels of treatment initiation, retention in care, and viral load suppression. Improved paediatric formulations could save countless lives. More focused, accelerated, and coordinated action is therefore of the highest urgency.
Going the last mile
Leaders from national and international organisations met in the Vatican on 17 November to discuss accelerating the development of priority paediatric formulations of ARVs. The meeting brought together major pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies, donors, governments and organisations that provide or support services for children living with HIV.
The meeting was led by Cardinal Peter Turkson, prefect of the Dicastery for the Promotion of Integral Human Development. ”Good will and the prophetic moral leadership of Pope Francis and other religious leaders will strengthen our resolve to make real and accountable progress in our efforts to eliminate paediatric HIV by making available early diagnosis and treatment to all children and adolescents who are living with HIV,” he said.
The meeting was in collaboration with the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), UNAIDS, Caritas Internationalis, World Council of Churches-Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance (WCC-EAA), WHO, and Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF). Caritas Nigeria, Caritas Democratic Republic of Congo and Catholic Relief Services brought concrete experiences, challenges and good practices.
Participants discussed an action plan to expedite the research, development, approval, introduction and uptake of optimal drugs and formulations for infants, children and adolescents. Proposals included both steps to make priority drugs in the pipeline quickly available in the short term as well as innovative mechanisms that could be put in place to accelerate the development of paediatric formulations of drugs for HIV.
Caritas Internationalis is ready to support the early adoption of priority formulations and diagnostics and take steps to facilitate their wider roll-out, including by developing introductory guidance, materials, and other tools for health facilities. Caritas will work with communities to help build treatment literacy, generate demand, and expand access to ARVs among children. Caritas will mobilise Catholic Church networks of hospitals and community structures to distribute paediatric medicines in hard-to-reach places and in situations of conflict and crisis. Caritas will increase efforts to share information on the roll-out of new paediatric formulations.

2355874,"Ending AIDS: What Got Us Here, Won’t Get Us There BY ICAP'S MIRIAM RABKIN & WAFAA EL-SADR

Today is World AIDS Day; a day to celebrate the enormous progress made in the three decades since the HIV epidemic emerged. It is also a time for reflection as we pause and pay homage to all of those who have fought and continue to fight for a world without AIDS, and remember those who lost their lives along the way.  

A decade ago, today's progress towards confronting the global HIV epidemic would have been unimaginable. The commitment of affected countries and communities combined with a remarkable global response has enabled nearly 21 million people – half of those living with HIV – to access life-saving HIV treatment. Treatment has transformed HIV into a chronic, but manageable, illness. In addition, results from large-scale population surveys conducted in Africa by the Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) project confirm this good news. More people than ever are testing for HIV as they seek and stay on treatment. These surveys are also helping us focus our resources in order to reach the millions that still need help.  

We even dare to speak of a future free of AIDS.  

What got us here? While the availability of affordable and highly effective drugs to treat HIV was a game-changer, global progress against this epidemic has relied on a comprehensive strategy called the public health approach to find people living with HIV, engage them in care, and provide treatment and important supportive services.  

This remarkable treatment scale-up was enabled by the streamlined and standardized characteristics of the public health approach. Standardized strategies for patient management, drug purchasing and distribution, laboratory testing, and documentation facilitated the rapid expansion of HIV programs, even in settings with limited numbers of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and laboratory experts. Critically, this systematic approach enabled simple and clear messages for both patients and health workers, and allowed HIV treatment to be provided by the breadth of health care providers, including physicians, nurses, medical officers, and community health workers.  

Yet, the way forward requires fundamental change. In order to reach global goals, another 10 million people living with HIV need to start treatment in the next three years. This won’t be easy, especially as resources have plateaued due to the misperception that the AIDS crisis is over. In many of the places most severely affected by HIV, fragile health systems translate to overwhelmed health workers and crowded clinics. Patients have to travel long distances to reach health facilities, taking them away from their families and jobs and creating financial burdens. All of these reasons compel us to innovate and iterate. We must think of new ways to extend prevention and treatment services to those not yet reached.

What got us here – i.e. the public health approach – won’t get us there – HIV epidemic control. 

An important new strategy is called differentiated service delivery, or “DSD”. DSD retains key elements of the public health approach, but enables the tailoring of services for different groups of patients based on their needs. While most of the attention to date has focused on the “what” of HIV treatment – what counseling to provide, which tests to order, and which drugs to use– DSD addresses the “how”. This may mean adjusting the intensity, location, and frequency of care, as well as the type of health worker to fit the needs of specific groups of patients. 

One DSD model involves community based treatment groups. First developed in the southern African country of Mozambique, the approach enables people living with HIV to provide support for each other in the community, while one member of the group returns to the clinic each month to get checked, report on the other members, and pick up medications for all. It’s a patient-centered approach that leverages the ability of individuals with HIV to self-manage their health, support and collaborate with each other, and avoid long waits at congested clinics.

DSD models are also needed for groups of persons living with HIV with unique needs like pregnant women, adolescents, men who have sex with men, sex workers, and people who inject drugs. The latter groups bear a disproportionate burden of HIV and face major societal barriers, such as stigma and discrimination, that stand in the way of access to vital services. Engaging members of these communities in designing, testing, and implementing DSD models is fundamental to their success.

Patients and communities have always been central to the AIDS response. As the public health approach evolves into DSD strategies, let us seize the opportunity to learn from their commitment and innovations.

2355829,"Blind spot: Reaching out to men and boys **On World AIDS Day, UNAIDS warns that men are less likely to access HIV treatment and more likely to die of AIDS-related illnesses**

*New report from UNAIDS shows the blind spot in reaching men with HIV services*

**OTTAWA/GENEVA, 1 December 2017—**On [World AIDS Day](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/campaigns/right-to-health), UNAIDS has released a new report showing that men are less likely to take an HIV test, less likely to access antiretroviral therapy and more likely to die of AIDS-related illnesses than women. The [*Blind spot*](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2017/blind_spot) shows that globally less than half of men living with HIV are on treatment, compared to 60% of women. Studies show that men are more likely than women to start treatment late, to interrupt treatment and to be lost to treatment follow-up.

“Addressing the inequalities that put women and girls at risk of HIV is at the forefront of the AIDS response,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “But there is a blind spot for men—men are not using services to prevent HIV or to test for HIV and are not accessing treatment on the scale that women are.”

In sub-Saharan Africa, men and boys living with HIV are 20% less likely than women and girls living with HIV to know their HIV status, and 27% less likely to be accessing treatment. In KwaZulu-Natal, the province with the highest HIV prevalence in South Africa, only one in four men aged 20–24 years living with HIV in 2015 knew that they had the virus.

In western and central Africa, a region that is struggling to respond effectively to HIV, only 25% of men living with HIV are accessing treatment. When people are not on treatment they are more likely to transmit HIV.

“When men access HIV prevention and treatment services, there is a triple dividend,” said Mr Sidibé. “They protect themselves, they protect their sexual partners and they protect their families.”

The report highlights data from sub-Saharan Africa that show that condom use during sex with a non-regular partner is low among older men, who are also more likely to be living with HIV—50% of men aged 40–44 years and 90% of men aged 55–59 years reported not using a condom. These data are consistent with studies showing a cycle of HIV transmission from older men to younger women, and from adult women to adult men of a similar age in places with high HIV prevalence.

The [*Blind spot*](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2017/blind_spot) also shows that HIV prevalence is consistently higher among men within key populations. Outside of eastern and southern Africa, 60% of all new HIV infections among adults are among men. The report outlines the particular difficulties men in key populations face in accessing HIV services, including discrimination, harassment and denial of health services.

Men who have sex with men are 24 times more likely to acquire HIV than men in the general population and in over two dozen countries HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men is 15% or higher. However, recent studies suggest that condom use is dropping in Australia, Europe and the United States of America. In the United States, for example, the percentage of HIV-negative gay men and other men who have sex with men who engage in sex without using condoms increased from 35% to 41% between 2011 and 2014.

“We cannot let complacency set in,” said Mr Sidibé. “If complacency sets in, HIV will take hold and our hopes of ending AIDS by 2030 will be shattered.”

The [*Blind spot*](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2017/blind_spot) shows that around 80% of the 11.8 million people who inject drugs are men and that HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs exceeds 25% in several countries. Condom use is almost universally low among people who inject drugs and the percentage of men who inject drugs using sterile injecting equipment during their last drug injection varies from country to country. In Ukraine, for example, the percentage of men who inject drugs who used a sterile needle at last injection was well over 90%, whereas in the United States only around 35% used a sterile needle.

In prisons, where 90% of detainees are men, HIV prevalence is estimated at between 3% and 8%, yet condoms and harm reduction services are rarely made available to detainees.

While HIV testing has been able to reach women, particularly women using antenatal services, the same entry points have not been found for men, limiting uptake of HIV testing among men.

“The concept of harmful masculinity and male stereotypes create conditions that make having safer sex, taking an HIV test, accessing and adhering to treatment—or even having conversations about sexuality—a challenge for men,” said Mr Sidibé. “But men need to take responsibility. This bravado is costing lives.”

The report shows the need to invest in boys and girls at an early age, ensuring that they have access to age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education that addresses gender equality and is based on human rights, creating healthy relationships and promoting heath-seeking behaviour for both girls and boys.

The report shows that men visit health-care facilities less frequently than women, have fewer health checks and are diagnosed with life-threatening conditions at later stages than women. In Uganda, some men reported they would rather avoid knowing their HIV status and receiving life-saving treatment because they associated being HIV-positive with emasculating stigma. One study in South Africa showed that 70% of men who had died from AIDS-related illnesses had never sought care for HIV.

The report urges HIV programmes to boost men’s use of health services and to make services more easily available to men. This includes making tailored health services available, including extending operating hours, using pharmacies to deliver health services to men, reaching men in their places of work and leisure, including pubs and sports clubs, and using new communications technologies, such as mobile phone apps.

It also urges a supportive legal and policy environment that addresses the common barriers to accessing HIV services, especially for key populations, and can accommodate the diverse needs and realities of men and boys. 

The [*Blind spot*](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2017/blind_spot) shows that by enabling men to stay free from HIV, get tested regularly and start and stay on treatment if HIV-positive, the benefits will not only improve male health outcomes, but will contribute to declines in new HIV infections among women and girls and to altering harmful gender norms.

**In 2016 (*June 2017) an estimated:**

\*20.9 million [18.4 million–21.7 million] people were accessing antiretroviral therapy

36.7 million [30.8 million–42.9 million] people globally were living with HIV

1.8 million [1.6 million–2.1 million] people became newly infected with HIV

1.0 million [830 000–1.2 million] people died from AIDS-related illnesses

2355614,"Six Caribbean territories and states eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis **The World Health Organization has validated Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Saint Kitts and Nevis as achieving dual elimination**

*Saint Kitts and Nevis/ Geneva, December 1, 2017* - Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat and Saint Kitts and Nevis were today certified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as having eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.

“This elimination is the result of our strong political commitment to public health and of making the health of mothers, children and families a regional priority,” said Timothy Harris, Prime Minister of St. Kitts and Nevis. Over the last six years the Caribbean has succeeded in reducing new HIV infections in children by more than half. “This is an amazing achievement given the high rates of HIV in the past, and we intend to improve on this success story even more in the future.”

Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and Regional Director for the Americas of WHO, said “This elimination is a remarkable achievement that puts the Americas at the forefront of the global effort to ensure that no child is born with HIV or congenital syphilis”. “With political commitment, stronger health systems, and timely prevention, diagnosis and treatment, we can achieve great changes,” she added. 

""UNAIDS congratulates the six states and territories on this important achievement,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “All countries should follow their example and ensure that every child has an HIV-free start to his or her life.”

In 2015, Cuba, another Caribbean island, became the first country in the world to receive validation from WHO for having achieved elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. Subsequently, Thailand and Belarus were also validated as having achieved dual elimination, while Armenia received validation of its elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and the Republic of Moldova was validated for the elimination of congenital syphilis.

Since the launch in 2010 of the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and Congenital Syphilis in Latin America and the Caribbean—coordinated by PAHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), with support from other regional partners—new HIV infections have been reduced in the Caribbean by more than 52% among children, from 1800 in 2010 to fewer than a thousand in 2016. Reported cases of congenital syphilis, meanwhile, remain below the goal of having no more than 50 cases per 100,000 live births, although they have not declined since 2010, and it is likely there is underreporting of cases.

“The elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis is not just a dream; it’s an achievable goal,” said Maria Cristina Perceval, UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. “Today we can say we are closer to ensuring an AIDS-free generation”.

In the Caribbean as of 2016, 74% of pregnant women living with HIV, 64% more than in 2010, had access to antiretroviral therapy to protect their health and significantly reduce the possibility of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. The increased access to treatment contributed to a 52% reduction in the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV between 2010 and 2016, which is now at 9%, still higher than the target of 2%.

Other changes in the health sector that have contributed to this progress include intensive participation by both the public and private health sectors, led by the ministries of health, in the implementation of comprehensive maternal and child health services, with an emphasis on universal coverage and quality antenatal and prenatal care. They also include expanded testing to ensure early detection and immediate treatment for both HIV and syphilis, laboratory networks of guaranteed quality in accordance with international standards and the implementation of essential measures to guarantee the human rights of women living with HIV.

“The validation for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis sends a strong message that the Caribbean is making remarkable inroads to achieving the goal of an AIDS-free generation and the achievement directly aligns with achieving our vision and objectives,” said Dereck Springer, Director of the Pan Caribbean Partnership against HIV and AIDS. “The spread of the disease from mothers to children is being halted, but elimination status must be maintained and other Caribbean countries must strengthen their services with the goal of receiving validation from WHO,” he added.

The elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis is an important milestone for ending AIDS and sexually transmitted infections as public health threats by 2030, commitments endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly and by the World Health Assembly. Other PAHO Member States in the Caribbean are participating in the formal validation process, and it is expected that more will be recognized for their achievements in 2018.

**Spotlight on HIV prevention**

This week, PAHO and UNAIDS launched their first joint report on HIV prevention in the Americas, entitled HIV Prevention in the Spotlight: A Health Sector Analysis in Latin America and the Caribbean. The report shows that the number of new HIV infections among adults remained stable in Latin America and the Caribbean between 2010 and 2016, at about 120,000 new HIV infections annually. The report urges countries to step up the implementation of a comprehensive package of interventions to prevent new HIV infections for key populations, so as to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030.

Among the report’s specific recommendations is expanded access to HIV self-testing and diagnosis of other sexually transmitted infections, the provision of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis as recommended by WHO, treatment for all people living with HIV, and eliminating discrimination.

**WHO validation process**

The validation process begins with a request from a country to PAHO for the validation of the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. Then, an independent Regional Validation Committee is formed to carry forward the process, using the global validation standards recommended by WHO.

In the case of these Caribbean states and territories, the members of the regional committee were experts from 10 countries of the Americas, who reviewed the reports of each state and carried out virtual and in situ evaluations in four key areas: health programmes and services, data and information systems, laboratory quality and human rights, gender equality and community participation.

On the recommendation of the regional committee, the Global Validation Advisory Committee conducted a second review and recommended to the Director-General of WHO the validation of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat and Saint Kitts and Nevis for the achievement of the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis as a public health threat.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) works with the countries of the Americas to improve the health and quality of life of their peoples. Founded in 1902, it is the oldest international public health organization in the world. It acts as the regional office for the Americas of the WHO and is the specialized health agency of the inter-American system.

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) leads and inspires the world to achieve its shared vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. UNAIDS unites the efforts of 11 UN organizations—UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, UNDP, UNFPA, UNODC, UN Women, ILO, UNESCO, WHO and the World Bank—and works closely with global and national partners towards ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.

**Note to editors:**

The indicators required by PAHO / WHO for validation in the Americas include:

Impact indicators—must be reached for at least two consecutive years:

30 cases or fewer of new perinatal HIV infections per 100,000 live births; and
50 cases or fewer of congenital syphilis per 100,000 live births; and
2% or below rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Process indicators—must be achieved for at least two consecutive years:

95% or more of all pregnant women should receive at least one antenatal care visit.
95% or more of pregnant women living with HIV tested for the virus.

2355479,"Ukraine: People co-infected with HIV to receive hepatitis C treatment in Mykolaiv region Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has begun treatment for hepatitis C with people who are co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV in Mykolaiv region, in southern Ukraine, where prevalence of HIV is two times higher than the average across the country.

People living with HIV are extremely vulnerable to contracting the hepatitis C virus, which is the fifth leading cause of death of people living with HIV in Europe.

In a joint effort with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Mykolaiv Regional Centre of Palliative Care and Integrated Services, 750 people living with HIV and hepatitis C, who are under antiretroviral therapy, will receive free effective treatment provided by MSF for chronic hepatitis C, using the medications sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. A further 250 people, consisting of those who formerly injected drugs and are on opioid substitution therapy, or are healthcare workers infected with hepatitis C, will also receive treatment.

MSF medical activity manager in Mykolaiv, Dr Marcelo C. M. Naveira, said: “There will be no true progress in the public health response to HIV/AIDS if hepatitis C-related deaths continue to affect people living with HIV.

“Stigma and discrimination directed at people who are co-infected must also be tackled. This project is meant to not only provide treatment for hepatitis C for people living with HIV, but also to improve access to medicines, and education and support for both diseases in Ukraine.”

A course of the treatment MSF is providing can be completed with oral medication in around three months, whereas for more than a decade, treatment options for hepatitis C have been restricted to 48 weeks or more. These older regimens have been known for their injections with high toxicity, severe adverse effects and poor success rates, preventing people living with HIV from receiving such treatment due to complications with antiretroviral therapy. New oral HCV treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir has very few side effects and a cure rate of more than 95% after 12 weeks of treatment.

As people living with HIV worldwide have faced a battle to obtain affordable generic versions of antiretrovirals, those living with hepatitis C in Ukraine are blocked by a lack of generic versions of the most effective medications. Currently, the US pharmaceutical corporation Gilead Sciences maintain a patent monopoly on sofosbuvir in Ukraine and even went as far as to sue the government, forcing them to de-register a generic version of sofosbuvir that could have been used.

Gilead has recently announced the inclusion of Ukraine in the voluntary licence deal which would allow up to 11 Indian generic pharmaceutical companies to register the drug. However, there is still no access to affordable generic versions. Daclatasvir remains unregistered in the country.

“For many years, Gilead viewed Ukraine and many other middle-income countries having high burden of hepatitis C as commercial markets, and kept them out of any ‘access’ initiatives like voluntary licenses that would have allowed the availability of affordable generic versions in the country”, said Jessica Burry, pharmacist for MSF’s Access Campaign. “Finally, after considerable pressure, Gilead has eventually caved in and included Ukraine in the territory of their licence with generic companies.  We really hope that the generic companies will start applying for registration soon in Ukraine resulting in competition, which would enable the Ukrainian Government to negotiate and bring the prices down to as low as US$100.”

Patients in MSF’s programme will also be supported with counselling and health education, in order to improve adherence to treatment and help them manage social issues as a result of their diagnosis. By providing information about hepatitis C and strengthening patients’ skills on seeking health services, MSF hopes will it be possible to overcome stigma and properly address patients’ needs.

When untreated, hepatitis C can lead to liver failure and liver cancer - complications that kill more than 700,000 people each year worldwide and symptoms of the virus may not display until it has reached a chronic stage. For people living with HIV, the disease progression is faster and time is vital in diagnosing hepatitis C.

MSF has also provided highly advanced diagnostic equipment to the centre in Mykolaiv, where testing began in November.

At the Mykolaiv Regional Centre of Palliative Care and Integrated Services, out of 1,940 people presenting co-infection of HIV and HCV, only 52 cases have been confirmed. A total of 8,819 people living with HIV are registered at the centre.

It has been 18 years since MSF began providing medical assistance in Ukraine, beginning in 1999 when the organisation worked in Mykolaiv, Odessa and Simferopol providing treatment for HIV/AIDS, as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the disease. Now MSF is tackling one of the highest causes of death for this population - the hepatitis C virus co-infection.

*In April 2017, MSF signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with the Ministry of Health in Ukraine, to improve hepatitis C treatment and reduce the morbidity and mortality of the virus among a cohort of 1,000 patients, including people living with HIV and hepatitis C, people who have injected drugs and have hepatitis C and around 100 healthcare workers infected with the virus. In May 2017, MSF signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Mykolaiv Regional State Administration*.",4596,"HIV/Aids"

Following is UN Secretary‑General António Guterres’ message for World AIDS Day, to be observed today:

The world is well on its way to meeting the target of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Nearly 21 million people living with HIV now have access to treatment — a number that should grow to more than 30 million by 2020. AIDS‑related deaths and new HIV infections are declining. There is great hope that the world can deliver on its promise. But much more needs to be done.

Sadly, some parts of the response to HIV are lagging behind. In some regions of the world, hard-won successes are being reversed, with rising numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS‑related deaths.

Women and girls continue to be disproportionally affected by HIV, particularly in Africa. Men are less likely to know that they are living with the virus, less likely to seek treatment for it, and more likely to transmit HIV as a result. Too many people are unable to access the services they need to treat their illness or to stay healthy.

On this World AIDS Day, I call for a renewed commitment to finish what we have started and to make the AIDS epidemic a thing of the past.

2355309,"WHO and Global Fund Sign Cooperation Agreements GENEVA – WHO and the Global Fund signed cooperation and financing agreements amounting to an estimated US$50 million today, with the aim of providing vital technical support to countries to fight HIV, TB and malaria, and securing additional progress toward universal health coverage.

Specifically the agreements will underwrite WHO’s work with countries to increase access to pre-qualified medicines and other health products, develop and implement new funding applications, help find missing TB cases, improve data collection, accelerate action toward malaria elimination in 21 countries and introduce the RTS,S malaria vaccine in three African countries.

“WHO and the Global Fund share a common mission and commitment to serve countries. These new agreements extend our close collaboration further,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. “Partnerships will continue to be critical for achieving the mission of WHO. We cannot do it alone, and rely on partners like the Global Fund to promote health – keep the world safe – and serve the vulnerable.”

WHO and the Global Fund have a long and successful partnership working together to expand HIV, TB and malaria interventions and strengthen health systems in many countries. This collaborative effort has resulted in significant reductions in the disease burdens of HIV, TB and malaria worldwide, saving millions of lives since 2002.

“Partnership is part of the Global Fund’s DNA, and together WHO and the Global Fund are a powerful force for global health,” said Marijke Wijnroks, Interim Executive Director of the Global Fund. “Working with countries and other organizations around the world, we’ll advance the fight against epidemics and help build strong and sustainable systems for health.”",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2354809,"Rights-based Approach Key to Reducing HIV/AIDS Prevalence, Risk among Migrants, Host Communities: IOM Geneva – On this World AIDS Day IOM, the UN Migration Agency, joins UNAIDS and other partners to work together towards ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat, by focusing on the right to health for all and by ensuring that quality health care is available and accessible to all.

Despite significant progress in reducing the HIV/AIDS burden around the world, there remain gaps in promoting health for several key populations including migrants and refugees, in accordance with international human rights obligations and relevant international and regional instruments. 

“In all regions of the world, punitive and discriminatory laws, policies and practices continue to violate human rights and maintain conditions that leave many populations without access to HIV services,” said IOM Director General William Lacy Swing on the occasion of World AIDS Day (1 December). 

It is encouraging to note that the UNAIDS 2016-2021 Strategy: on the Fast-Track to Ending AIDS, identifies migrants, refugees and crisis-affected populations for targeted responses. However, this will require urgent action across the entire spectrum of rights for these population groups including civil, cultural, economic, political, social, sexual and reproductive rights.

IOM firmly believes that to achieve the vision of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals – to leave no one behind – and meet the Universal Health Coverage targets, it is imperative that the health rights and needs of migrants be adequately addressed across all sectors using evidence and a whole-of-government approach.

“While migration does not automatically equal HIV vulnerability, and not all migrants and mobile populations are at increased risk for HIV, in many contexts these populations are exposed to a unique set of socio-cultural, economic and environmental factors that make them more vulnerable to HIV,” said Jacqueline Weekers, Director of IOM’s Migration Health Division.

Around the world, IOM works with governments and international partners to deliver programmes that adopt a rights-based approach to decrease HIV vulnerability and risk among migrants, by ensuring universal access to HIV prevention, care, treatment and support, and countering misinformation and stigmatization surrounding migration.

For instance, as a component of IOM’s pre-departure health assessment programmes, IOM offers counselling and HIV testing for refugees and migrants traveling to over fifteen host countries. So far in 2017, IOM has provided over 65,000 HIV tests, including pre-and post-test counselling, in more than 50 IOM operations worldwide. Where necessary, IOM provides referrals for follow-up care to local or national health systems.

In South Sudan (2016-2017), populations of humanitarian concern now have improved access to HIV/AIDS counselling, testing, and treatment since IOM completed the roll-out of comprehensive services at the Bentiu, Malakal and Wau Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites in October 2017, benefiting an estimated 171,000 people including members of the host community.

In the Middle East, IOM is implementing the Middle East Response (MER) programme (January 2017 – present), an innovative multi-country approach aimed at supporting the continuum of care in conflict settings by providing essential HIV but also TB and malaria services to refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) as well as host communities in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Jordan.

In Myanmar (2014-2016), IOM established drop-in centres for female sex workers and men who have sex with men in migration-affected localities. The centres offered a space for peer education training, self-help groups, and access to Voluntary Confidential Counselling and Testing (VCCT), regular sexually transmitted infection screening, and anti-retroviral therapy.

One of the key commitments outlined in the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants adopted in 2016 was ‘to address the vulnerabilities to HIV and specific health-care needs experienced by migrants and refugees’.

The Declaration also called upon Member States and partners ‘to take the necessary steps to reduce the stigma, discrimination and violence they face on the basis of their HIV status, in addition to supporting their right to health and access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support’.

To achieve these goals, it is imperative to ensure that the health of migrants and refugees is adequately addressed in the Global Compact for Safe, Regular and Orderly Migration, and Global Compact for Refugees.

Statement by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General 
1 December 2017

Since the very beginning of the epidemic, the HIV response has been centred on human rights, equity and communities, the very foundations upon which universal health coverage has been built.

As the HIV epidemic has evolved over the years, it has been the most vulnerable, marginalized communities and individuals that have been disproportionately affected.

As early as the 1980s populations at greatest risk of, and people living with, HIV argued that communities must be at the centre of any response if the threat of HIV is to be overcome.

Soon it became evident that the meaningful involvement of those communities was not only a moral imperative but also constituted good public health practice; public health measures could reach those populations and locations most affected, improve service uptake and efficiencies, achieve equitable coverage and result in greater and more sustained impact.

The HIV response has played a critical role in transforming public health, and in turn has influenced the shaping of the universal health coverage agenda.

We have achieved much in the past 30 years. Today 21 million people are receiving antiretroviral therapy that is enabling them to live full and productive lives. Every day, fewer people are becoming infected with HIV and fewer people are dying. But these successes are masking the many disparities and challenges that persist.

Why, after three decades of recognizing the critical role of communities in driving the HIV response are we still seeing those populations most at risk being left behind, marginalized and discriminated against?

Why is it that men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender people, people who inject drugs and prisoners, representing 40% of new HIV infections in 2016, continue to be denied the most basic health services?

Why is it that many young women, adolescents, migrants and displaced persons find themselves particularly vulnerable to HIV infection?

And, why is it that adolescent boys and young men do not access the HIV and other health services provided ?

On this World AIDS Day we are here to remind you that “Everybody Counts”!

Everybody counts if we are to achieve universal health coverage and everybody must count if we are to eliminate AIDS and viral hepatitis as public health threats. Health services should be adapted to reach and meet the needs of those populations most at risk and affected, and this includes implementing a ‘zero tolerance’ policy to stigma and discrimination in all health services, and fully engaging communities as equal and essential partners in the response.

It also means that the acceptability and quality of the services must be high, ensuring that people are retained in care and achieve the best possible prevention and treatment outcomes.

Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the services they need, wherever they live, without facing financial hardship. People at risk of and living with HIV usually have multiple health needs, which go far beyond the need to access condoms, sterile needles or antiretroviral therapy.

An effective HIV response embraces integrated people-centred care, in which the full health needs of individuals and communities are addressed, not just those related to HIV. Countries are showing us how HIV interventions and services are being integrated into broader health programmes, how they are being effectively linked to other services, such as those for tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, sexual and reproductive health, non-communicable diseases and substance use disorders. By doing so, health systems are being strengthened and people living with HIV are reaching their full health potential.

Providing the right health services to those who need them, in itself, isn’t enough. If we are to achieve equity, to reach universal health coverage and to ensure the right to health for all, we need to work beyond the health system. The broader policy and social environment continues to play a critical role in shaping HIV epidemics and facilitating or hindering effective responses. The principle of ‘everybody counts’ must be enshrined in policies, laws and practices that span across all relevant sectors, adopting a whole-of-government approach.

The message is simple – make everybody count!",4596,"HIV/Aids"
2354714,"Government of Sweden and four UN agencies announce new Joint Programme to boost efforts to achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive health and to end AIDS This World AIDS Day, December 1, the Government of Sweden, together with the regional offices of UNFPA, UNAIDS, UNICEF and WHO, announces the start of a USD45 million Joint United Nations (UN) four-year Regional Programme to reduce unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), new HIV infections, maternal mortality and sexual and gender-based violence (GBV) across East and Southern Africa.

Rooted in the spirit of UN reform and a commitment to Deliver as One, the new Joint Programme combines the strengths of the four UN agencies to support governments and other partners to deliver country-level and people-centered results.

It will achieve this through addressing the policy and legal barriers that prevent people from exercising their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). It will support governments to scale up and deliver quality, client-centered integrated HIV/SRHR and GBV services, and work to ensure that communities, including key populations, are empowered to exercise their rights, access services and adopt safer behaviours. It will support governments to strengthen data collection,  quality, analysis and use to ensure that no one is left behind.

The Joint Programme recognizes that despite significant progress made, East and Southern Africa (ESA) remains the epicenter of new HIV infections, with high levels of unintended pregnancies and millions of women exposed to sexual and gender based violence. It promotes focused, urgent and committed action to propel the response so that the region achieves the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets of universal access to SRHR, to end AIDS as a public health threat and to eliminate sexual and gender-based violence by 2030, ensuring that no one is left behind.  

New HIV infections in the ESA region declined by 29 per cent – from over 1 million in 2010 to around 790,000 in 2016. However, even at the present rate, the region is unlikely achieve the target of reducing new infections by 90 per cent by 2030, without urgent and coordinated action at all levels. Four thousand (4000) adolescent girls and young women are infected with HIV each week, 44% of all births in the period 2010 – 2015, occurred amongst adolescent girls and young women. Pregnant adolescent girls and young women living with HIV face significant challenges to initiate and stay on ART treatment. Adolescent girls and young women risk being left behind unless the barriers to information, contraceptives and sexual and reproductive health services are removed.  

Maternal mortality in the ESA region has declined by 56% - from 918 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1990 to 407 in 2015, a 3.6 per cent reduction per year. Lack of access to modern contraceptives to prevent unintended pregnancies, haemorraging, HIV & AIDS, high levels of unattended births, and poor postnatal care, continue to place the lives of many pregnant women at risk. Without serious action the region is unlikely to meet the SDG target of reducing maternal mortality to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.

Sexual violence committed by people other than intimate partners and intimate partner violence (IPV) are widespread in the region. In several countries, around one quarter of women have experienced physical violence at the hands of their partner in the past year. Sexual violence increases the risk of women having unintended pregnancies, STIs and HIV, yet many women do not have knowledge of nor access to emergency contraceptives, antibiotics and antiretrovirals (pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP). More must be done if the region is to achieve the SDG target of eliminating all forms of gender based violence.

The Programme will focus its efforts on five countries - Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The lessons learnt from these five countries will be amplified and shared with other countries so that they can strengthen their responses.

2354589,"South Sudan: Delivering HIV treatment to conflict areas **For people in rural South Sudan, HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy (ART) can be nearly impossible to obtain. Moving between villages is extremely difficult and the war has forced many to flee to isolated locations. But in Yambio County (southwest of the country), things are different. Mobile and same day testing and treatment, provided by Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF), is improving the lives of people coping with HIV.**

“In the past, there was very little treatment for people living with HIV in the area. The sick just suffered and died,” says Arkangelo Ruben, a tribal chief and community leader from South Sudan´s Western Equatoria region.

“Reaching a drug dispensary usually took several days. Things got worse when the fighting started; many fled to areas without healthcare.”

MSF had previously worked in Yambio and wanted to examine the best way of providing effective antiretroviral therapy to the population. Here HIV prevalence in Yambio is estimated at 3.4 per cent, well over the national average.

**Responding to the challenge**

To meet this challenge, MSF initiated a “Test and Treat” pilot programme with the support of the Ministry of Health. It has been running for two-and-half years and will finish in June 2018. Two mobile teams are running six centres where people are tested and receive treatment in the surrounding countryside.

“Rather than make patients come to a distant dispensary, our service calls into rural communities at set times,” says Farhan Adan, MSF project coordinator in Yambio.  

“A patient could be tested and have the results in a day. Treatment can start immediately. Counsellors are on hand to explain how HIV will impact patient´s lives.

“While this concept is new to this region, the Test and Treat approach has been tried in other parts of Africa and was first introduced by the WHO. The big difference with this project is that Yambio is in a conflict setting. From time to time violence flares, leaving populations cut off from the outside world.”

**Raising awareness**

“In the early days, we had to go to each house explaining the service. Sometimes families lived in very isolated parts of the forest; our teams had to walk for hours to find their huts,” explains Isaac Zinaro, MSF’s community health worker supervisor.

“Now people know when we are in their village.”

The most recent figures are promising. Between June 2015 and the start of November 2017, 14,804 people were tested for HIV. Of these, 505 tested positive and 401 were enrolled in the programme.

Patients have unbroken access to medication. Often, patients receive a supply to last three months, even if their villages are cut off. A volunteer or focal point is selected to collect the drugs for a group of patients. These patient groups also serve as support groups, reinforcing the community/patient-centred model of treatment.

**“Now my medicine comes to me”**

One patient benefiting from Test and Treat is Nama Martin, who was diagnosed as HIV-positive 10 years ago.

“I look after 15 children. I don’t have any money and very little time,” she says.

“It used to take me two days to travel to Yambio and back. I had to include the cost of a night’s accommodation. My children were alone. Now my medicine comes to a neighbouring village which is within walking distance.”

As the pilot phase nears its end, a local partner, Catholic Medical Mission Board, is gearing up to take over the project.

“With the Yambio areas covered by our project, the next move is to pass on what we have learned from this pilot programme to other health providers with the help of the Ministry of Health,” says Jaume Rado, MSF head of mission for South Sudan

The information was disclosed by the executive secretary of  the Angola’s Aids Service Organisations Network (Anaso), Antonio Coelho.

According to António Coelho, the Aids situation in Angola is generally worrying and dramatic in some regions of the country, blaming the spread of the disease in Luanda on the high concentration of people.  

The spread in the provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul (northeast), Cuando Cubango and Cunene (South) is owed to the great inflow of foreigners in diamond mining areas, he explained.

António Coelho said Anaso has registered 95,850 people living with the Aids virus, 62,580 of which under retroviral drugs while 33 percent have quit treatment for various reasons.

He added that the number of men who have sex among themselves has risen three percent, prostitutes seven percent and prison inmates five percent.

According to him, the situation calls for a redesigning of Anaso’s strategy that has put its focus on people aged between 15 and 24 years.

The meeting featured briefings by the UN’s humanitarian heads in Ethiopia, Somalia, and South Sudan.

Humanitarian response and prevention is at the heart of the UAE’s foreign aid and assistance. The UAE is deeply concerned by the different situations in the Horn of Africa, from war to climate change, and is partnering with OCHA to illuminate the options for the UN community and donors to empower these countries and their people to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The humanitarian situations in the three countries continue to cripple their development progress. Drought has pushed Somalia to the brink of famine, as well as threatened lives in many parts of Ethiopia, despite strong government leadership in the 2016 and 2017 drought response. Conflict in South Sudan, worsened by climate change, has caused over 2.3 million people to flee their homes and 1 million people at risk of famine in 2018.

The meeting looked at both funding needs – which are especially acute in South Sudan – as well as innovative options to prevent and mitigate crises. These include techniques like forecast-based financing, which mandates donors to release money for humanitarian action before harsh weather strikes, and the tailoring of programs for specific demographics.

Established in 2006, the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (EHF) responds to disasters triggered by natural hazards, such as droughts, floods and outbreaks of diseases, as well as conflict-related crises. The EHF aims to support the timely disbursement of funds to the most critical humanitarian needs in the context of both the annual Humanitarian Requirements Document (HRD) and emerging unforeseen emergency needs.  

Since its inception in 2006, the EHF has mobilized US$ 451.3 million and allocated $442.2 million to 720 projects through 59 partners, including United Nations (UN) agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  

In 2016/2017, the EHF continued to play an important role as a timely and flexible financing mechanism, supporting the humanitarian community to achieve its goals by funding the most critical needs in response to the El Nino and the Indian Ocean Diapole driven droughts.  

The EHF in 2017 allocated $80.3 million supporting 102 multi-sectoral projects in partnership with 31 organizations. Thus far the Fund received funding from seven donors namely Germany, Ireland, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States of America.   
USA is the highest contributor to the Fund followed by the Germany.

2385299,"Supporting Access to Finance for Climate Action: A Guide to Support Implementation of the Paris Agreement – Part One **1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW**

**What is climate finance?**

Climate finance refers to local, national or transnational financing, which may be drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing. Climate finance is critical to addressing climate change because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions, notably in sectors that emit large quantities of greenhouse gases, and to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of climate change .  
The Paris Agreement includes the goal of ‘making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development’, clearly signalling that all sources of finance need to be aligned with the adaptation and mitigation goals set in the Agreement. Through the Agreement countries commit to preparing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which contain the climate action they commit to as part of the global effort to transition to a low carbon, climate resilient world. These NDCs will be updated every 5 years with a view to increasing their ambition so as to reach the temperature goals set in the Paris Agreement.  
Developing countries signal in their NDCs the actions that they can implement with their domestic resources and the actions they can take if they received international support. 

**Sources of finance for climate action and NDC implementation**

Finance to support climate action and to implement NDCs comes from multiple sources and will not always be labelled or clearly recognisable as climate finance. For example, support to the health sector may be building capacity to cope with the increased prevalence of vector borne diseases associated with warmer temperatures, and investments in the agriculture sector may support for greater resilience to drought. In fact, given the considerable overlaps between activities to implement the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework, development finance will play a significant role, especially in the LDCs and SIDS, in supporting climate action .  
Development assistance will also play a role in leveraging private sector finance for climate action through, for example, the use of risk guarantee instruments or blended finance arrangements. 

The climate funds are important sources of finance for climate action and NDC implementation.  
The international climate funds include the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the funds led by the Multilateral Development Banks such as the Climate Investment Funds and bilateral funds specialising in climate. As a result, the climate finance landscape is very fragmented which increases the challenges associated with accessing finance and reduces overall efficiencies. This is why country ownership is essential, to guide resources to where they are most needed and to target the funds best suited to a country’s needs. The diversity of funds can have advantages, allowing for specialisation, for example, by focusing on LDCs or on specific aspects of climate action such as technology or adaptation.  
It is important to match countries’ or communities’ needs to the most appropriate source of climate finance. The procedures for direct access to the GCF or the AF may place these funds beyond the immediate reach of countries with very weak capacity, and in these cases access to finance via an international intermediary (e.g. UN agency) or through bilateral development assistance may be appropriate, while in parallel applying for readiness support to enable direct access accreditation in the future. Like development assistance, philanthropy has a role to play in catalysing other sources of finance for climate action, to fill any gaps (thematic or geographical) and to provide risk guarantees in order to attract private sector investment. Flexible and catalytic funding are as important as large scale investments and there is demand for both small amounts of easily accessible finance (e.g. through the GEF Small Grants Programme) as well as transformational finance at scale for major climate initiatives (e.g. through the GCF). Finding the right source of finance for a country or project is important – there is no one size fits all.  
Tools like the NDC Funding and Initiatives Navigator can help to identify the best fit fund for a particular context. 

**How much is needed?**

The UNEP Finance Initiative estimates that the costs of the transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies will need investment at an order of magnitude of at least USD 60 trillion, from now until 2050. This includes approximately USD 35 trillion to decarbonize, through renewable energy and energy efficiency, the world’s energy system; USD 15 trillion to adapt manmade infrastructure to changing meteorological conditions; and 2 USD trillion to reorganize global land-use is ways that meet growing demands for agricultural commodities while stopping tropical deforestation.

The UNEP Adaptation Finance Gap report estimates that the costs of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to USD 280–500 billion per year by 2050, a figure that is four to five times greater than previous estimates .  
There is of course a narrower definition of climate finance based on commitments made under the UNFCCC and focused on the commitment made by developed countries in Copenhagen in 2009 to mobilise USD100 billion per year in support for developing countries by 2020. Note that this includes both public and private sources of finance.

**Tracking finance**

There are efforts under way to measure progress towards the USD 100 billion target and climate finance mobilisation more broadly.

This includes the work of the UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance which has a mandate in relation to the Financial Mechanism of the Convention in terms of:

• Improve coherence and coordination in the delivery of climate change financing,

• Rationalize the Financial Mechanism,

• Mobilize financial resources, and • Measurement, reporting and verification of support provided to developing country Parties.

The committee produced the 2016 Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows Report which provides an overview of climate finance flows from developed to developing countries as reported in biennial reports, multilateral climate funds, climate finance from multilateral development banks and private climate finance.

In 2015 the French and Peruvian Governments in their capacities as Presidents of COP 21 and 20, commissioned a study by respectively the OECD and CPI ‘2020 Projections of Climate Finance Towards the USD 100 Billion Goal’ which concluded that USD 62 billion in public and private sources were directed to developed countries from developing countries in 2014. 

The OECD DAC uses the Rio Markers to track development finance that supports climate action in developing countries. Bilateral climate-related ODA from DAC members reached USD 29 billion per year in 2014-156 . Of this 49% (USD 14.3 billion) addressed mitigation only; 29% (USD 8.4 billion) addressed adaptation only; and 22% (USD 6.3 billion) addressed both adaptation and mitigation.

The OECD countries regularly report to the UNFCCC about their international climate finance support. They report in the form of National Communications (every four years) and Biennial Reports (every two years). This system of reporting will eventually be replaced by a new reporting system within the transparency framework under the Paris Agreement. The monitoring of climate finance flows is difficult and often contested as there is no clear definition of what constitutes climate finance and transparency is frequently an issue.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

- Fighting between armed groups in Nangarhar displaced more than 61,000 people since mid-October, 45,000 of which have received assistance.

- Ramped up winterisation assistance reaches the most vulnerable families across the country.

- The 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan calls for US$430 million to assist 2.8 million people in acute need.

- Furthermore, 8.7 million people are in chronic need in Afghanistan.

- Married off with 13 years for the dowry – Amana’s story after her father decided to force her into marriage.

- 12 humanitarian workers were injured in assaults in November, bringing the total of wounded aid workers to 27 this year

**Massive displacements in Nangarhar**

Following a series of clashes over the past months between two competing non-state armed groups in Khogyani district, Nangarhar, intense fighting erupted mid-October provoking the displacement of more than 40,000 people in just a few days to Khogyani district centre, Behsud, Chamtala, Chaparhar, Pachieragam and Surkh Rod districts, as well as Jalalabad City (see map on next page). Renewed fighting at the end of November led to another wave of displacement, forcing several thousand people from two dozen villages.  
To date, more than 61,000 people have been displaced from Khogyani district.

**Less than two hours to flee their home and find transport to safety**

“There was fighting everywhere around our village and we decided to leave,” said one man who recently arrived in Surkh Rod district centre, 25 kilometres from the Khogyani district centre. “We walked at night because we thought it would be safer. But still one of us got struck by a bullet.” Abdul Jalil, who fled his village in Khogyani district two weeks ago, remembered: “We had less than two hours to get ready.” The mason was lucky enough to be able to afford to pay for transport and packed his wife, five children and a mattress into the taxi. “I paid US$90 to get here, three times the usual price.”

This chilly morning, he waited at a food distribution site organised by the NGO Afghan Planning Agency (APA), a national NGO-partner of the World Food Programme (WFP), fidgeting with the paper slip between his fingers that identified him as one of 300 heads of family who would receive a monthly food ration. Almost 5,500 families have already received either food or cash assistance intended to buy food.

**Overstretched public health services**

A group of women with children crowd the courtyard of the public clinic of Surkh Rod, looking for the reception. They all were displaced from Khogyani. One of them, Habida, explains that she lives in an improvised shelter covered by a tarp in the garden of a relative. “We are 13 people every night. It is cold and our children are getting sick.”

The director of the clinic, Dr. Samiullah, confirms the added pressure that the displaced families are putting on the existing health services: since mid-October, when the first influx of displaced families from Khogyani arrived in Surkh Rod, the number of patients treated increased from an average of 4,000 to 7,000 per month. Most of the consultations are for respiratory diseases.

However, the number of trauma cases has significantly increased from only a few per month mostly caused by road traffic accidents to around 200 per month. “The majority of them are gunshot wounds,” the doctor observed.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

2379299,"Sudan Humanitarian Fund 2017 Second Allocation paper **I. Background and overall guidance**

- Thanks to generous donor contributions from Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and DFID, a second SHF allocation for an amount of $7.5 million is launched. $2 million will also be set aside in the Reserve for Emergencies in accordance with the SHF criteria (SHF Programme Manual). 

- Partners seeking funding from the SHF 2017 second allocation must adhere to the guiding principles and strategic objectives outlined in this paper. Proposals not in line with this paper will not be considered for funding. 

- The 2017 SHF positioning contains an overarching strategic positioning that guides all 2017 allocations. In line with the World Humanitarian Summit commitments this allocation focuses on front-line responders. The second round SHF allocation supports the three outcomes of the 2017 Multi-Year Humanitarian Response Plan 1) populations affected by natural or man-made disasters receive timely assistance during and in the aftermath of the shock, 2) displaced populations, refugees, returnees and host communities meet their basic needs and/or access essential basic services while increasing their self-reliance and 3) vulnerable residents in targeted areas have improved nutrition status and increased resilience. 

- Please refer to the SHF Operational Manual for process related issues and SHF Programme Manual for minimum programmatic requirements, programmatic guidance and guidance on budgets.  

**A. SHF Strategic Priorities for the 2017 Second Allocation**

- This allocation will complement the CERF 2017 Underfunded Emergencies Grant for the newly accessible areas in South Kordofan and Blue Nile by focusing on the same localities. 

- Projects in this allocation should address immediate needs through emergency, life-saving assistance and in parallel increase resilience of the most vulnerable and their communities. Increased ownership by communities of projects informed through participatory approaches should also result in some form of sustainability and lay a foundation for follow-up through longer term approaches. 

- Well informed conflict sensitive programming that clearly indicates risks and mitigation measures needs to be part of all approaches to guarantee peaceful coexistence of IDPs and host communities. 

**South Kordofan $4 million**

Eligible organizations: low and medium risk NGOs with proven experience in the targeted sector(s) and established presence in the state and localities (all sectors), UN agencies only for protection projects Targeted localities: Kadugli, Habila, Rashad, El Abassyia Targeted sectors and indicative1 envelopes: Livelihood ($2,000,000), Health ($700,000), WASH ($650,000) and Protection (Child Protection and Mine Action $650,000). 

Per the latest figures, South Kordofan State (SKS) has 179,137 verified IDPs and is also hosting 39,866 refugees. In addition, there are 14,055 recent returnees who did not receive any form of humanitarian assistance yet. In 2017, 7,224 people (2,316 households) were displaced from SPLM-N controlled areas to Kadugli. This SHF allocation prioritizes interventions in the newly accessible areas in the abovementioned localities and areas with new arrivals.  
In areas with a significant number of returnees, for example Al Abassiya, projects should also include returnees to contribute to a harmonious living environment for all inhabitants.

**Livelihoods**

The new displacement in 2017 was triggered by poor food security and general lack of services in SPLM-N areas. Half of SKS is facing acute food security and livelihood crisis as per 2016 agricultural season outcome and the situation is expected to worsen due to a projected early end of rains this year.  
This SHF allocation welcomes different types of livelihood support opportunities which should be based on clear needs assessments and should be supported by the communities throughout the project cycle. These can range from winter season agriculture, livestock support, income generating activities to longer term approaches including but not limited to training, village savings and loan associations, and farmer schools.  
Innovative cash assistance components within projects are encouraged when the methodology is clearly defined, as are mechanisms which engage the local community in salaried work linked to training for the implementation of some of the activities.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2379104,"Positioning of the Sudan Humanitarian Fund in 2018 **Overall purpose**  
The Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF) is a country-based pooled fund that should contribute to the overall operational impact of “the provision of timely, coordinated, principled assistance to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity” within Sudan. The SHF aims to promote a strategic and coordinated response towards the highest priorities in support of the Humanitarian Response Plan (or HC agreed strategy) and acute emergency needs. Projects should be based on the fundamental humanitarian principles and be in line with the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) approved Minimum Operating Standards.  

**Positioning statement**  
The SHF facilitates response to new emergencies ideally identified through joint or coordinated needs assessments as well as to protracted crises. The Reserve for Emergencies, guided by specific criteria, equaling a minimum of 20% of the overall SHF initial contributions is foreseen in 2018 alongside other allocations. The response to the protracted crises in Sudan remains important with a focus on multi-sector and longer term responses that integrate early recovery and resilience components facilitated through some multi-year commitments. Short term projects are encouraged to link to and leverage other funding sources in order to promote sustainability and/or continuity. The SHF will promote cash based programming and work through innovative approaches as for example consortiums to enable more coherent coverage and strategic area-based allocations. The SHF promotes the integration and mainstreaming of cross cutting issues such as gender, environment, ‘do no harm’, protection, and accountability to affected populations at all project stages.  

The SHF will prioritize the provision of funding to NGOs working as front-line responders to the emergencies in Sudan as localization is one of the World Humanitarian Summit commitments and as clearly stated by donors to the SHF as a principal added value. The SHF will target 70% of direct funding to be allocated to NGOs. Sectors are encouraged to ensure robust national NGO participation to enhance capacity and facilitate funding by the SHF. Strengthening partnerships with national NGOs to gradually build their capacity and ultimately improve humanitarian response is important while being cautious of adverse effects. Given the foregoing, programme support costs (7%) should be shared proportionally with non-governmental sub-grantees. Subsequent levels of sub-granting should be limited and show added value. The Fund promotes an approach of working in partnership with the Government through collaboration and capacity enhancement and promote this over sub-granting to the Government.  

In line with the primary focus of the Fund on the front-line response, the below highlights some of the strategic choices made within the Fund allocation priorities. Funding of sector coordination is not considered a priority for the SHF as all lead agencies have made commitments to the IASC Cluster Coordination system at the global level to fund sector coordination. Emergency preparedness, needs assessments, core pipelines/procurement by lead agencies and common services (Telecom, logistics including UNHAS, Security, Data tracking) can be exceptionally eligible for funding when critical importance and a funding gap coincide.

Food aid (except for therapeutic food) is too resource intensive given funding levels of the SHF. It is of very low priority for the SHF and will ordinarily not be considered for SHF funding.

The SHF will seek complementarity with CERF, in-country humanitarian, recovery and development funding mechanisms and donors in order to increase impact of the response to people in need.

The majority of PHPF funding acts as a bridge to cover gaps in humanitarian service provision of urgent humanitarian needs. In many cases, this has been the only funding available to meet critical humanitarian needs.

2374224,"The future of the Start Network **Summary**

To prepare for the change needed in the future, the Start Network’s 42 members came together over the last six months, to co-create a vision for the network based on our 8-year experience. This proposal was unanimously endorsed by our membership in November 2017.

The Start Network proposes a humanitarian system in which funding will be predictable, dependable and based on need. Responses will be defined by the recipients, and early funding will reduce the impact of crises and the cost of response. Our vision is based on the principles that: Power and capability are located as close to the front line as possible; financing is needs-driven, predictable and dependable; benefits are shared across the network at all levels; and resources flow in a transparent and accountable way. The Start Network has been working towards this vision since 2010. We have made significant progress but, like the wider humanitarian sector, we need to evolve. To bring about the change needed to humanitarian incentives and behaviours, we need to get better at what we do. The process of changing the Start Network (called Start Evolves) has involved deep engagement from a wide range of stakeholders.

*New York, New York, 13 December 2017*

*As delivered*

Deputy Secretary-General, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2017 Global Humanitarian Policy Forum.

 The purpose of the forum is to generate good new ideas on how to better assist those caught in crises.

Every day, those who work in humanitarian response are confronted with extreme misery and complex problems to tackle.

Therefore, it is good to remind ourselves that progress is possible.

Between 1990 and 2015, the number of people living in extreme poverty fell from 1.9 billion to 836 million.

The child mortality rate fell by more than half over the same period.

However, while it is important to believe that progress is possible, the truth is, the scale of problems in crises is devastating and huge.

Today we are putting online OCHA’s 2017 World Humanitarian Data and Trends Report, one of the most comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of humanitarian trends. One of the things it shows is that over the past decade, the number of conflicts rose from 278 in 2006 to 402 in 2016.

Combined with the impact of natural hazards, this has reversed years of progress on global hunger, with the number of under-nourished people reaching 815 million in 2016.  

Conflict, economic shocks, climate change and the failure of political systems to address them, have led to the number of people who rely on humanitarian assistance over the past decade, to triple. 

Despite these challenges, I believe there is room for hope.

Eighteen months since we gathered at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, much has been achieved, as outlined in this fantastic first annual progress report that I am pleased to launch today. 

Today you have just received the summary but I encourage you to read the full report.

First, I would like to thank the 142 Member States, companies and humanitarian and development organizations that reported on their progress, which enables us to see what is happening as commitments are implemented, and to contribute to holding each other to account.

Over the past 18 months, we have started to promote better join-up between humanitarian and development activities. As the Deputy-Secretary-General said, crises will not be solved by humanitarian interventions, but through political and development solutions.

One of the areas I am most excited about is the new arrangement of the Steering Committee put in place by the Deputy-Secretary-General. We are already starting to see good practice emerging from countries ranging from Somalia to Mauritania, and development institutions are engaging in new ways, led by the World Bank but others are also investing more in crises.

The Grand Bargain has mobilized more than 50 donors and aid agencies to improve the transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of aid and financing. We have upgraded to OCHA’s Financial Tracking System (FTS) and linked to international transparency standards (IATI) and are beginning to get better reporting and tracing of funding flows.

I welcome that donors are also scaling up multi-year financing and cash transfer programming.

On Friday, we began to fund the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). I was encouraged that it not only received a record amount in 2017, crossing the US$500 million mark for the first time, but also that many donors committed over multiple years.  
The best financing is fast and long-term.

Another example of progress is the greater access that local organizations now have to international system finance. Last year, national NGOs received $171 million through OCHA-managed Country-Based Pooled Funds, the majority through direct grants. This very nearly meets the Grand Bargain target of 25 per cent of aid being provided to local responders.

Other organizations are also taking steps to drive forward their commitments to support a response that is “as local as possible, as international as necessary.” For example, online learning tools are helping local partners strengthen their financial and human resource systems. Building the capacity of local organizations is critical as it can give financiers more confidence to invest directly. 

Member States are also investing more in education, health-care, and livelihood programmes for refugees and host countries, most notably through the new $2 billion international development association sub-window for refugees and host communities.

Another good example is how International Financial Institutions such as the World Bank are playing a positive role in helping direct more investment to fragile situations, to increase resilience and address root causes of vulnerability.

Greater use of insurance-based financing is one of the trends we are observing. In the last five years, the African Risk Capacity, a new initiative for African countries to insure themselves against adverse weather events reducing harvests, has paid out $35 million, helping more than 2 million people affected by drought in Senegal, Niger, Mauritania, and Malawi.

Through a similar facility, in September, Dominica received an insurance pay-out of $19 million just two weeks after it was hit by Hurricane Maria. The speed of this pay-out was powerful, and demonstrates how these kinds of mechanisms can contribute.

This is a decent score card for just a short time period. But we need to see more progress in other areas.

We urgently need durable solutions for the more than 40 million people who are internally displaced by conflict and violence, and we need greater efforts by Governments and partners to reduce internal displacement by half by 2030.

This means adopting new approaches to internal displacement and working towards collective outcomes which reduce needs, reduce risks and reduce vulnerabilities of IDPs and host communities over time. It also means applying the right mix of humanitarian and development financing at the right time, to help achieve durable solutions.

We need robust action from global leaders to strengthen the protection of civilians in conflict and to stop the atrocious, violations of international humanitarian law in today’s war zones.

We must find better ways to reduce the scourge of gender-based violence in conflicts, and we have to do a better job of holding perpetrators to account.

And we must also all work to eradicate all incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers, and implement a zero-tolerance policy across all humanitarian response.

Finally, and most importantly we have to put affected people right at the heart of all our efforts. This is the test we must always apply.

Together, we can lift people out of crisis, but only by redoubling our efforts to deliver on the commitments we have made. The global humanitarian response system reaches millions of people every year, but there is ample room for improvement. The more positive ideas we can generate today can improve our response and benefit people in need.

Thank you.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2366709,"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, Welcome remarks at the annual high-level pledging conference for the Central Emergency Response Fund New York, 8 December 2017  

*As delivered*

The Secretary General, Mr. António Guterres, Excellencies, Ministers, Distinguished guests, Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to the Annual High-Level Pledging Conference for the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund – or CERF – for 2018.

This is the first Conference that ushers the transition towards the new funding target of $1 billion by 2018 that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly last December. 

Your endorsement is a resounding vote of confidence in CERF as an effective instrument to rise to the challenge of our times. 

Today, I am proud to say that, with 12 years of enabling humanitarian partners to save and protect hundreds of million lives globally, CERF is our shared success.   
I would like to thank the 126 Member States and Observers as well as 45 non-governmental entities for making this possible. 

I am pleased to inform you that CERF has surpassed its previous funding target of $450 million, with a strong position to reach a record high annual income. 

But while we celebrate CERF as our shared success, we also face significant challenges as the humanitarian community. 

For 2018, the humanitarian community is appealing for $22.5 billion to meet the needs of 91 million people in 26 countries.  

2017 itself saw significant demands for CERF where CERF’s support was stretched to the maximum with early and catalytic funding to thirty-six emergencies.

Due to increasing number of requests, reducing allocations to individual crises has become a necessity for CERF.  These decisions have concrete implications – for the survival and protection of millions of men, women and children. 

Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, 

The math is simple – a larger CERF means that more people will be reached with life-saving aid, faster. 

New strategies and approaches are being developed in close consultation with partners to optimize impact with increasing funding to CERF. 

For example, I would like CERF to further promote early action to prevent pandemic outbreaks. In January last year, the spread of yellow fever outbreak in Angola was successfully contained due to urgent vaccination campaigns, partly funded by CERF. In 2014, CERF was one of the earliest sources of funding for the multi-country Ebola outbreak enabling humanitarian partners to kick-start vital services reaching 37 million people.

One of CERF’s strengths is that it brings humanitarian organizations together at country levels to collectively assess and prioritize humanitarian needs for urgent response. Moving forward, I would like to build on this and explore CERF’s potential to further enhance coordinated needs assessment and analysis in line with Grand Bargain priorities. 

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

A strong CERF able to deliver on its mandate is every Member State’s responsibility and a step towards our commitments to leave no one behind and reach the furthest left behind first.  

This year’s Conference will initiate the pledging process for 2018 as part of broader efforts and milestones in the year to strengthen the role of CERF to address current humanitarian challenges. 

We count on your continued support and engagement through CERF.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2366509,"Underlining $11 Billion Gap in Global Humanitarian Funding, Secretary-General Urges Pledging Conference to Support ‘Super’ Central Emergency Response Fund SG/SM/18819-IHA/1442

Following are UN Secretary‑General António Guterres’ remarks at the annual high-level pledging conference for the Central Emergency Response Fund, in New York today:

It is a pleasure for me to be here with you to celebrate a United Nations success story — the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).  Over the past 12 years, CERF has been at the forefront of humanitarian response.

I have long been, as Mark [Lowcock] said, a champion of this Fund, having seen its effects in humanitarian crises around the world.  CERF is without question one of our most important tools to reach people quickly and to save lives.  Thanks to CERF, country teams can start relief efforts immediately with prioritized programmes designed to reach the most vulnerable people first.

The Central Emergency Response Fund supports a vast network of partners.  It steps in when an existing crisis gets worse.  And it helps to sustain operations, when the spotlight has moved on, in chronic crises that sometimes do not get the attention they need.

We have just seen some of the life-saving work funded by CERF this year.  It provided nearly $130 million to help prevent famine in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.

Nutrition and healthcare services funded by CERF are particularly important for the children and pregnant women who suffer most from hunger and malnutrition.  When I visited Gaza in August, I released $4 million from CERF to help fund United Nations activities until the end of this year.

In the last three months, $19 million in CERF funding has gone to Bangladesh, to help with the sudden influx of more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.  And when hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the Caribbean, CERF helped tens of thousands of people get access to shelter, food and clean water.

CERF not only works quickly; it is designed to ensure that humanitarian aid gets to the most urgent cases first, including women and girls who are disproportionately affected by crisis.  It supports strong coordination between humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations.  And it acts as a catalyst to mobilize resources from elsewhere.  From reproductive health services in northern Nigeria to emergency shelter in Afghanistan, CERF has a real impact on the lives of the most vulnerable.

I thank the 126 Member States and Observers, and the other donors who have generously contributed to the fund over the past 12 years.  Every CERF donor, regardless of the size of their contribution, shares in its achievements.  This is truly a fund for all, by all.

We need CERF now more than ever.  Since CERF was launched in 2005, humanitarian needs have increased from $5.2 billion to over $24 billion today.  Protracted conflict and the impact of natural disasters, compounded by structural fragility and chronic vulnerability, mean that more people than ever survive on the brink of disaster.

Conflict and early warning indicators show that in the next year, 2018, protracted crises are likely to continue, while the impact of climate change is likely to grow in intensity and in impact.  There is no sign of a let-up in humanitarian needs.  To keep pace, the General Assembly adopted a resolution exactly a year ago, calling for an expansion of CERF’s annual funding target from $450 million to $1 billion.

I was among the first to propose a “Super-CERF” for the biggest emergencies, in my previous role as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  I was acutely aware of the need for United Nations agencies and others to respond to crises more quickly and more effectively.  I thank Member States for endorsing this call, which sent a message of global solidarity with people in crises, and with those furthest behind.

Humanitarian programmes funded by the CERF are essential, if we are to fulfil the shared ambition of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — one blueprint that is our blueprint for an inclusive, sustainable future with lives of dignity for all on a healthy planet.  Providing emergency aid is vital in itself, but it is also an important foundation for resilience, sustainable development and job creation in protracted and underfunded crises.

As a further contribution to these efforts, I am pleased to announce a CERF allocation of $100 million dollars to meet critical needs in nine underfunded emergencies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Cameroon, Mali, Philippines, Eritrea, Haiti and Pakistan.  In all these crises, CERF funds will enable United Nations agencies and their partners to carry out essential life-saving activities, and contribute to longer-term resilience and stability.

My experience in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has shown me that CERF is always the first to come when we have an emergency, and the last to leave when situations are forgotten.  I would say that CERF never leaves when situations are forgotten.

But, much more is needed.  The global humanitarian funding gap stands at $11 billion as of 30 November.  Humanitarian response plans are funded at an average of just 60 per cent.  A $1 billion CERF will help to bolster contingency financing so that we are able to mitigate and respond to humanitarian suffering quickly in the future.

One billion dollars is an ambitious but achievable goal.  I hope you will take action to reach this target here today, or as soon as possible.  A strong United Nations needs a strong CERF.  It is essential to support the lives and livelihoods of millions of people — women, girls, men and boys — who depend on humanitarian aid to lift them out of crisis and give them hope of a better future.  I count on your continued generous support.  Thank you very much.

The Start Fund opened its Crisis Anticipation Window in November 2016.

In this report, we set out the changes we have made so far, identify what we’ve learned during our first year and explain our plan to normalise and embed anticipation across the Start Network. These improvements to the Start Fund have been made possible by the European Union, who are supporting us to develop our crisis anticipation capacity. Anticipation alerts continue to be funded through the pooled Start Fund mechanism, meaning that all Start Fund donors contribute to the implementation of early action through the Start Fund.   

There is increasing evidence that acting early is more effective, in terms not only of costs saved but also of lives saved. Our aim is that the systematic use of forecasts and hazard modelling, along with a rules-based decision-making system, will trigger earlier action. We believe that this will help to reduce the overall cost of humanitarian assistance. There will always be a need to respond to crises that are difficult or impossible to foresee, such as earthquakes or epidemic outbreaks. However, we intend to move towards triggering funds automatically whenever we are sufficiently confident in our predictions.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2363339,"Contributing to global stability and peace: Council adopts improvements to the EU's assistance instrument Press release 752/17

On 7 December, the Council adopted a regulation improving the EU’s instrument for contributing to stability and peace (IcSP).

This measure forms part of an EU-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform.  It aligns the objectives of the instrument with the commitments made by the EU towards the UN sustainable development goals and the recently agreed new European consensus on development.

The revised instrument introduces the possibility for the EU to finance measures in support of capacity building for security and development (CBSD) of military actors in partner countries, with the objective of contributing to sustainable development and in particular the achievement of peaceful and inclusive societies.

The regulation will be officially signed in Strasbourg on 12 December. It will be published on 15 December and will enter into force on 16 December.

The IcSP was first set up in 2014 as part of the EU's new generation of instruments for financing external action. It is one of the main tools to help prevent and respond to crises in third countries as part of ensuring a secure and stable environment.

Under the new rules agreed today, the EU will be able to assist the security sector and, in exceptional circumstances, support the military in various ways, including through:

- financial support to enhance the competence of the military to carry out development and human security-related tasks such as the reconstruction and rehabilitation of civil infrastructure, mine clearing and civil protection tasks;

- supply of equipment and infrastructure for the military in the areas of IT, transport, communication, water infrastructure and sanitation;

- training, mentoring and advice.

The regulation does not allow EU assistance to be used to finance recurrent military expenditure, the provision of arms and ammunition or lethal equipment or combat training.

The new measures will be allocated €100 million for the period 2018-2020.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2362149,"Local humanitarian action in practice - Case studies and reflections of local humanitarian actors **New publication launched: Local Humanitarian Action in Practice – Case Studies and Reflections of Local Humanitarian Actors**

**December 6th, 2017, London – The Humanitarian Leadership Academy and the British Red Cross have released a new publication: “Local Humanitarian Action in Practice: Case Studies and Reflections of Local Humanitarian Actors”, which highlights successes and the unique challenges faced by local humanitarian actors. The publication is launched over a year after the Grand Bargain commitments were affirmed by the international community.**

Agreed at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016, the Grand Bargain commits donors and aid organisations to allocate global humanitarian funding by at least 25% to local humanitarian responders by 2020, remove barriers to partnerships, and provide multi-year funding for institutional capacity to ensure continuity in humanitarian response.

The case studies highlight the experiences of 10 national and local humanitarian organisations across Central and South Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and South and South-East Asia that have led or managed humanitarian response. These local actors operate in areas that are highly vulnerable to recurrent natural and climate-induced disasters, instability, civil conflict, and other emergencies.  

The publication affirms what is being recognised by international and local organisations, that locally-led responses have critical advantages. These include better access to and deeper connections with affected people and local structures; greater understanding of the relevant geopolitical and cultural context; and a clearer view of what needs to be done in response to a crisis.    

In the foreword, Dr. Jemilah Mahmood, IFRC Under Secretary-General and Chair of the Academy, emphasises the need to “play to the to the strengths of each actor and building complementarity and an appropriate balance between local, national, and international humanitarian assistance. It also means respecting local actors, working with local actors based in principled partnerships, and focusing our collective efforts on ensuring strong, sustainable, relevant, effective local organisations.”

These views are echoed throughout the case studies. Mr. Esteban Masagca, Executive Director of People’s Disaster Risk Reduction Network (PDRRN) in the Philippines says: “External assistance should be directed towards enhancing the survivors’ indigenous coping strategies and local capacities, and that any intervention should be based from a thorough understanding of the situation of a particular community and that there is no single prescribed strategy that can apply to all.”

Local actors featured reiterated that change must happen at all fronts. As Mr. Belal Hossain, Director for Disaster Risk Management of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society notes, “Lasting impact requires a change in the mindset of the government and the population, including those affected by crises. But this will not happen overnight.”

Despite successes demonstrated by the case studies, the study reveals that in many situations, these same actors continue to face obstacles to greater autonomy and sustainability. In many countries, local humanitarian actors still find barriers to locally-led humanitarian response, such as access to secure and predictable funding, local actors being regarded as service delivery providers, and reluctance of some international agencies to invest in capacity strengthening and long-term partnerships. The study notes that challenges from the international aid mechanism, which maintains control on how support from the international community is provided and how resources are distributed. 

Ms. Halima Adan, Programme Manager at Save Somali Women and Children in Somalia emphasises: “Sustainability is not yet a reality in Somalia. Long-term partnerships need to be pursued to help rebuild trust and deliver better services through mechanisms such as consortium based approaches and multi-year funding, with elements of capacity-development.”

Through these case studies, the research hopes to influence institutions at the global level to actively involve local actors in policy-making and implementation of global humanitarian aid. 

With the increasing shift to a resilience approach, the study demonstrates how local humanitarian actors are finding ways to introduce innovations, such as the effective use of technology and cash programming for early warning-early action, improved sustainability through private sector collaboration, social enterprise development and provision of technical service, and an ambition to establish a pool of future local humanitarian aid professionals. 

**Ms. Pansy Tun Thein, Executive Director of the Local Resource Center in Myanmar closes:** “To do things differently, international actors must learn to work with the local actors; they must learn to trust and give them opportunities to take the lead where relevant, as they know the country context and understand the culture.”

Local humanitarian actors are not just ready to lead the way—they are already doing so. To make the Grand Bargain commitments a reality, it is time for the international community to step up and invest their resources where they can make the biggest difference.

2362049,"VOICE Out Loud Newsletter Issue 26: Exploring the humanitarian-development nexus Today’s crises are increasingly complex and the number of people in need worldwide is rising as a consequence of man-made and natural disasters. 
 
The EU is focusing on finding a response to these crises and the humanitariandevelopment nexus is seen as the tool for reinforcing the links between the two sectors, increasing the complementarity of their actions in order to address the root causes of the crises and reduce needs. But what are the challenges and the opportunities of this approach? We have asked our NGO members to contribute to the debate on this important topic.

After a quick overview of the history and the key definitions to introduce the nexus approach, ADRA Denmark opens this edition by writing about the Danish Strategy for development policy and humanitarian action, identifying the positive elements that could inspire the EU approach while also highlighting its limits. Several of our members analyse the nexus from a different perspective: Tearfund writes about localisation as a key strategy in connecting humanitarian and development programming while World Vision analyses the financial aspect of the nexus and the importance of multi-year planning and funding. The International Rescue Committee explains their view on cash-based assistance as a way to bridge humanitarian and development programmes.  

For the ’View on the EU’, Care EU and Care France question whether EU trust funds represent the best modality for the humanitarian-development nexus.  

To better understand the EU’s work on the nexus, we have interviewed Ms Cabral,  Head of the Unit for Fragility and Resilience in the Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development of the European Commission. Together we discussed the nexus, the EU’s new Strategic Approach to Resilience, and the 6 pilot countries chosen to start the operationalisation of the nexus.

- Is the world’s most comprehensive, authoritative and evidence-based assessment of humanitarian needs;

- Is based on detailed analysis of wide-ranging data from many different sources, and face-to-face interviews with hundreds of thousands of people directly affected by humanitarian crises across the globe;

- Sets out detailed, prioritised, costed plans for meeting the needs of affected people, coordinated across the United Nations, with contributions from governments, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, other international organisations, NGOs and other relevant actors;

- Facilitates principled, effective, rapid and coordinated responses to humanitarian crises, supporting prompt life-saving action by humanitarian agencies generously financed by governmental, private and individual donors

**Reviewing 2017**

- In 2017, humanitarian agencies reached more people in need than ever before: tens of millions of them, saving millions of lives;

- Donors provided record levels of funding to Humanitarian Response Plans—nearly $13 billion by the end of November;

- Humanitarian agencies helped stave off famines in South Sudan, Somalia, north-east Nigeria and Yemen, through effective scale-up and the rapid release of funds by donors;

- Agencies stepped up to provide rapid assistance to refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar; and • Mobilized to support countries in the Caribbean to prepare for and respond to successive hurricanes of a ferocity rarely seen before.

- Despite conflict and other constraints complicating the provision of assistance, plans were implemented effectively, with costs averaging approximately $230 a year per person for essential needs.

**In 2018**

- Conflict will continue to be the main driver of humanitarian needs.

- Protracted violence will force people to flee from their homes, deny them access to enough food, and rob them of their means of making a living.

- Droughts, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters will also create humanitarian needs. Although the risk of El Niño or La Niña is low next year, some scientists forecast an increased risk of earthquakes in 2018.

- In a number of countries, humanitarian needs will fall, but still remain significant, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Mali, and Ukraine.

- However, needs are rising substantially in Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.

- And needs will remain at exceptionally high levels in Nigeria, South Sudan, the Syria region, and Yemen, which is likely to remain the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

- Overall, 136 million people across the world will need humanitarian assistance and protection.

- UN-coordinated response plans costed at $22.5 billion can help 91 million.

-overall number of people in need is more than 5% higher than in the 2017 GHO. The cost of the response plans sets a new record, about 1% higher than at the start of 2017.

- Humanitarian agencies will become more effective, efficient and cost-effective. They will respond faster to crises, in a way more attuned to the needs of those they are trying to help. They will undertake more comprehensive, cross-sectoral and impartial needs assessments.  
They will also contribute more to long-term solutions by working more closely with development agencies.

- Larger country-based pooled funds will improve the agility and prioritised use of funds in the places where they operate. An expanded Central Emergency Response Fund will better support the least-funded major crises.

2351744,"Joint Statement by Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency Vice-President, Mr. Süreyya Er and Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ms. Ursula Mueller **Issued at the conclusion of the Global South-South Development Expo 2017 Leadership Roundtable: ""From delivering aid to ending need: Advancing the 2030 Agenda in crisis contexts"", Antalya, 29 November 2017**

The Global South-South Development Expo was held this year at a time of unprecedented global humanitarian need. In 2017, a record 145 million people across the globe required humanitarian assistance and protection.

The increases in human suffering are driven by protracted conflicts and natural disasters. Marked by mass displacement, fractured livelihoods and a breakdown in governance structures and basic services, the resultant complex emergencies exact a toll that lasts decades. Even with record amounts of funding for humanitarian response in recent years, contributions lag far behind the ever-increasing numbers of people in need of assistance.

Today, however, we heard messages and insights in the high-level Leadership Roundtable that were very much focused on the crucial role of the global South in pushing back the seemingly never-ending increase in human misery.

Governments, regional actors and civil society in the South are already on the front lines of humanitarian action, from hosting the vast majority of the world's refugees to carrying out and, increasingly, funding the response.

In 2016, Turkey was the world's second largest donor and most generous country in terms of her ratio to its national income, spending US$6 billion on humanitarian assistance. Turkey hosts millions of displaced Syrian people and her intervention in Somalia saved millions from starvation and created hope for future by providing fundamental means for resilience; delivered timely food aid to Kirkuk in Northern Iraq, Afghanistan and violence-affected Rohingya people in Bangladesh. Moreover, Turkey involves in long-term development works to ensure sustainability in wider geography.

While bilateral humanitarian assistance dominates South-South Cooperation, Southern partners are also increasingly channelling their support through effective multilateral organizations. In 2017, the OCHA-managed Central Emergency Response Fund received contributions from Chile, China, India, Ivory Coast, Kuwait, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, among other emerging donors.

Today we also heard participants reaffirm their Governments' and organizations' commitment to our plan to move beyond the cycle of crises: the New Way of Working. Launched at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul and encapsulated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development goal ""to reach the furthest behind first,"" the New Way of Working is catalyzing shifts in collaboration between development and humanitarian actors, from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Chad, and from Ethiopia to Mauritania.

We heard an innovative 'South-South driven triple-win financing modality' of Lives and Livelihood Fund (LLF) from the representative of Islamic Development Bank, that has been deployed successfully to mobilize resources for fragile and least developed countries.

In two days, the Global Humanitarian Overview 2018 will be launched in Geneva and we will again be confronted with record numbers of people in need. That is why are extremely grateful to all of the participants who took part in the Leadership Roundtable today. The massive and complex humanitarian crises of today cannot be tackled without the spirt of cooperation we saw on display. Together we will leave no one behind.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

2346864,"The State of the Humanitarian System 2018: Inception Report **1. Summary and Aims** 

Following the publication of the 2015 SOHS report this inception report sets out the goals and scope of research for the 2018 edition and details its methodological approach. It incorporates the findings from a conference set up to review the methodologies used in the 2015 edition, as well as other lessons learned from previous after-action reviews.  

The 2018 edition will assess performance over the period January 2015–December 2017. It will also compare its findings with the three previous editions, in order to capture key trends covering a 10-year period. The 2018 SOHS report will therefore provide an up-to-date assessment of the size and shape of the humanitarian system and its current performance; and also a retrospective picture of key trends and changes that have taken place over the last decade.

To ensure that the report is as readable and useful as possible, a few small but important modifications have been made. First, in order to make clear the parameters and scope of the report, the study team has developed a precise definition of the unit of analysis – the international humanitarian system. In addition, it has made changes and improvements to the OECD DAC criteria used to assess performance; and, in response to requests from readers of previous editions, the methods used to gather data from aid recipients have been strengthened. The study team will also seek to liaise with local groups and organisations in the collection and analysis of this data.  
In view of the commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS), the study team will introduce and pilot a new methodology aimed at capturing outcomes that may be emerging as a result of the reform processes underway. The aim will be to report on whether and how these outcomes are having any impact on overall performance.

As with previous editions, the report will be primarily descriptive and analytical rather than prescriptive. It will be based on a robust and tested method combined with the best available evidence and, although the analysis will reflect insights into the factors bringing about changes and trends, the main aim is not to provide concrete recommendations for change and improvement.  
The SOHS report is intended as a resource for all people and organisations that work in, or with, the international humanitarian community.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2346854,"Roles for philanthropy in the humanitarian sector **LANDSCAPE OF THE HUMANITARIAN SECTOR**

**The need for humanitarian assistance is severe, global, and growing.** Today, humanitarian crises – events that present a critical threat to the health, safety, security, or wellbeing of a group of people – affect over 125 million people in every region of the globe. This number has almost doubled since 2011.  
These crises range from highly-publicized refugee crises like Syria, affecting more than 10 million people and receiving 31% of all humanitarian assistance in 2015, to “forgotten crises” like the armed conflict in Colombia, affecting almost 6 million people and receiving 0.2% of assistance.  

**Funding is increasing but not fast enough, and not to all places in need**. Funding for humanitarian assistance reached a record high of $28 B in 2015, a 40% increase since 2011. However, in the same year the sector also faced the largest recorded shortfall to date (by some accounts) – a 45% gap in UNcoordinated appeals for funds. The donor pool is highly concentrated – three-quarters of all funding comes from 20 government donors, with the top five government donors providing almost half of all funding.  

Private foundations contribute a tiny ~1% of total humanitarian assistance. The targets of humanitarian assistance are also becoming increasingly concentrated – in 2015, five crises (in Syria,  
Yemen, South Sudan, Iraq, and Sudan) accounted for more than half of all funding allocated to specific emergencies, as opposed to the third of funding the top five crises received in 2011. In contrast, certain “forgotten crises” – such as the Sahwari refugee crisis in Algeria and the ethnic conflicts in Myanmar – are routinely missing from international media headlines and remain underfunded year after year.  

**Beyond the gaps in funding, the changing nature of crises has created new challenges in the landscape.**  Crises are increasingly long-term. In 2015, there were 6.7 million refugees living in situations of protracted displacement; the average length of these situations is 26 years. The increasing length of crises necessitates the continued involvement of humanitarian actors – almost 70% of the 58 countries that received humanitarian aid in 2014 were in their 10th straight year of receiving aid. Crises are also increasingly complex, driven by a combination of social, political, and environmental forces, rather than any one issue. Over 95% of crises between 2013 and 2015 were defined as complex emergencies – those characterized by extensive violence and displacement, widespread damage to societies and economies, and / or the hindrance of humanitarian assistance by security risks or political constraints.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2345594,"7 million children under threat in the DRC: Brussels donor meeting has to focus on saving more lives Monday, November 27 – With 7 million children affected by the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, now is the time for the EU and its Member States to step up their support. They need to go beyond pushing for elections and instead investing in addressing the needs of one of the world’s most vulnerable populations. 

World Vision’s DRC Director Scott Lout said: “A massive humanitarian crisis has been unfolding in the Congo almost unnoticed. The scale and brutality of what is happening to children in hard to reach places in the DRC is almost unimaginable.” 

Millions of children are now displaced by conflict, suffering extreme hunger and living in abject poverty and in fear of their lives. World Vision fears that former child soldiers will re-join armed groups and continue conflict without psycho-social support. 

Pauline, 15, who attends a World Vision child safe space, told World Vision staff: “I knew some girls who joined the militia. They were my age, or even younger than me. They went off to battle to kill people and drink their blood.” 

“Children, who have been demobilized, freed or have fled militias, must immediately benefit from programs that protect them from further harm and improve their physical, emotional and mental health” says Jonathan Beger, World Vision Brussels’ Director of EU Advocacy. “The Brussels donor meeting has to rapidly increase funding and focus aid on children and their communities to prevent a resurgence of ethnic and tribal violence, or we lose yet another Congolese generation.”",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2345514,"The Business Case: A study of private sector engagement in humanitarian action **Executive Summary**

The private sector is a fundamental component of local communities affected by humanitarian crises, and it has long been engaged in humanitarian emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Private sector actors are present before humanitarian crises occur and as crises unfold, and they are among the first part of society to respond. Private sector actors, whether small or large, operating directly in humanitarian contexts or indirectly through supply chains, can leverage their own expertise, resources, channels and influence to address humanitarian needs and make positive contributions to long-term sustainable peace and development. 

They can do so independently by working directly with people affected by humanitarian crises, as well as by collaborating with humanitarian organizations at the local, regional and international levels.  
Much has been written on how humanitarian organizations see private sector engagement, on the value of private sector engagement to humanitarian action, and on the need for companies to comply with international humanitarian principles and human rights standards. However, little has been said on how private sector actors perceive their own engagement in humanitarian action. 

This study was motivated by an increasing public recognition that while Governments have the primary responsibility for humanitarian assistance and planning, the changing humanitarian landscape and needs can no longer be addressed effectively by humanitarian actors alone. The study is aimed at three key audiences: private sector actors, the humanitarian community and Governments. 

This study focuses on the perspectives of private sector actors regarding their engagement in humanitarian action, collated from a review of existing published material, 51 interviews, and a survey of 36 representatives of businesses and business foundations. Through these perceptions, this study attempts to promote a better understanding of private sector humanitarian engagement, and to encourage principled, timely and effective humanitarian action through collaboration. The results were collated and used to identify four key rationales/motivations identified by the private sector, recognizing that any specific engagement may simultaneously incorporate one or more rationales. 

In addition to grouping the responses into different rationales and models, the paper captures the diverse and individual voices of different company representatives, providing vivid examples of what motivates their companies, employees, shareholders and customers to engage in humanitarian action.  
The study notes that companies take partnerships with humanitarian organizations seriously, and that 70 per cent of respondents said that the expected value or return on investment was very important in deciding whether to pursue a partnership. However only 37 per cent said that they formally measure the value of the engagement. Many noted the importance of goals in partnerships and the need to avoid a loss in value. Others noted that projects are expected to provide a credibly attributable return on investment within defined time frames. 

The study provides recommendations from private sector actors for other businesses, Governments and humanitarian organizations. The recommendations are intended to improve engagement strategies for businesses, and to identify opportunities for Governments and the humanitarian community to further their goals in shaping partnerships and other informal methods of engagement. 

The study stresses that in order to achieve positive and effective humanitarian impact, adherence to humanitarian principles and human rights standards should be as important for businesses as it is for humanitarian and other actors. More tools to support private sector engagement in humanitarian engagement are also needed.  

The study concludes by noting that additional work is required for a fully comprehensive and more rigorous study on the motivations for businesses to engage in humanitarian action in a variety of different geopolitical contexts. More research is also required that comprehensively includes small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to understand the return on investment and opportunities for companies to play a positive role in raising public awareness on issues that may be relevant to humanitarian action.

- Collaborative preparedness tools and resources

- Access to global innovations

- A model for NGO-led, principles-based decision making

- Collaborative platform for new ways of working

But as a network we can go even further and catalyse greater change to help people affected by disasters.

The world is facing fundamental changes. Climate change, population growth, depleting natural resources, systemic interdependence and geopolitical fragmentation and division - which are combining to alter the scale and dynamics of humanitarian crises. The UN Secretary General’s Final Report to the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 concluded that the international humanitarian system must change to meet this growing demand.

Members join the Start Network to be a part of a global effort to change the humanitarian system. And together we have achieved a great deal in our first eight years in terms of creating financial mechanisms that respond earlier and faster, investing in new innovations, and modelling collaborative ways of working. To prepare for the change needed in the future, the Start Network’s 42 members came together over the last six months, to co-create a vision based on our 8-year experience. This is a summary of this vision. There is a longer internal document which also includes detail on governance, membership and the business model. This full document is to be ratified by the Start Network Assembly in November.

• Localisation: Responses to crises will be defined by those closest to them and based on humanitarian need 

• Risk financing: Early and predictable funding will reduce the impact of crises and the cost of responses

• Collective innovation: A diverse group of organisations will work together to adapt to the needs of people affected by crises",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2343934,"Building a More Climate-Resilient Community **Statement at CARICOM-UN High Level Pledging Conference on Building a More Climate-Resilient Community; Segment: Response from Partners Including Perspectives on Financing Reconstruction and Resilience. UN Headquarters, New York**


*As prepared for delivery*

It is a pleasure to be at this CARICOM-UN High Level Pledging Conference on Building a More Climate-resilient Community precipitated by the disasters unleashed on the Caribbean following Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We have heard about the staggering impact of these hurricanes on the affected countries and territories in the presentations made so far, and the huge financial cost that it will take to build back better and to build a climate-resilient Caribbean.

It is in this context that I am honored to have the opportunity to make some remarks and to call for a new financing architecture to build resilience as articulated by the CARICOM Secretary General this morning. This event provides an invaluable opportunity to discuss how the international community can improve international financing arrangements for the Caribbean – and all climate-vulnerable states – as well as scale-up innovations in lending and insurance for the region. We in UNDP are happy to be supporting this event. There are many good proposals on the table as discussed yesterday. Going forward, we need to translate them into action recognizing that we are dealing with a “new normal” and we cannot wait even for a moment to build climate resilience. At the outset, let me say that UNDP is fully committed to playing its part to support you. 

The recent disasters in the Caribbean have laid bare the deficiencies of the international development finance architecture for countries like those in the Caribbean. As stated at yesterday’s technical consultations and repeated today, some of the most severely affected countries are ineligible for concessional finance or ODA. It is inconceivable to expect small vulnerable countries that have been almost entirely destroyed to rebuild on the back of non-concessional finance in a region already challenged by the loss of correspondent banking relationships due to de-risking.

Simultaneously, we need a facility to support middle-income and high-income SIDS vulnerable to both climate-related and economic shocks with access to concessional finance. Recent efforts to enable Jordan and Lebanon to access concessional finance from multilateral lenders show this can be achieved. These efforts must be expanded to include highly vulnerable countries not on an exceptional basis, but as the established way of doing business as articulated by the CARICOM Secretary General this morning. 

We need to expand the delivery of ‘risk-informed’ finance through innovations in lending, such as hurricane clauses and countercyclical loans.  Indeed, there is much we can learn from Grenada in terms of using these countercyclical instruments. Prime Minister Mitchell, I am sure you will be speaking to the experience of Grenada in using this innovative instrument.

Many Caribbean countries are severely indebted. High debt can be made worse through heavy reconstruction costs. Innovative solutions such as a multi-creditor debt-for-resilience swap could be considered. UNDP and UNECLAC are exploring this and we invite others to be part of this effort so we can have a win-win situation of debt swaps for climate action. 

We support the CARICOM Chair’s proposal to establish a “Fund of Funds” for SIDS that will help pool and blend finance from multiple sources for transformative programs. While we look to the future, we need to ensure that we focus now on the adequate and effective financing of reconstruction and recovery that does not further indebt Caribbean countries and territories. UNDP supports solutions that, where appropriate, mix national and international financing, public and private.

At the same time, the private sector has an important leadership role in helping to provide the much needed financing for the region for reconstruction and to help build resilience across the Caribbean, and in other climate-vulnerable countries like those in the Pacific. For example, the insurance industry must play a critical role. From UNDP’s perspective we see three critical areas for the industry, including: (i) the need to widen risk knowledge; (ii) review existing insurance mechanisms and coverage, including expanding innovative insurance mechanisms; and (iii) risk-informed reconstruction. UNDP is already innovating in the area of insurance and resilience of public natural goods with partners.

I know the challenges you face in picking up the pieces after these unprecedented disasters and I want to assure you that we are with you every step of the way. I also believe that it is a time of opportunity and I am also inspired by your cogent and compelling vision to become the world’s first climate-resilient region.

2335729,"Finance for resilience building and ecosystem-based adaptation in Kenya: A comparative study of local and national managed funds **Summary** 

Since the establishment of the Green Climate Fund, research interest on funding modalities to deliver adaptation and development benefits to the local level has grown exponentially. A key question is how climate change funding can be effectively channelled to support adaptation, including ecosystem-based adaptation initiatives, in natural resource dependent dryland environments. This paper compares the strengths and weaknesses between a locally and a nationally managed fund to supporting development and climate change initiatives in Isiolo County, Kenya. Using two case studies of the Isiolo County Climate Change Fund (ICCCF) and the Community Development Trust Fund (CDTF), this working paper compares their degree of alignment to development strategies, access to funds by beneficiaries, accountability and transparency measures, the benefits of financial investments, opportunities and challenges.

The research described here forms part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI) project ‘Ecosystembased approaches to adaptation (EbA): strengthening the evidence and informing policy’. Globally, EbA initiatives to date have consisted largely of standalone projects, but they need to be implemented at scale in order to reap the social and environmental benefits needed in a changing climate. The two funding models described show how EbA is or could be mainstreamed into national and county level government planning in Kenya, with finances made available accordingly. It thus provides key lessons on how EbA can be implemented and funded at scale, whilst retaining community knowledge and adaptation needs at its core. Such lessons are relevant for decision makers and planners who would like to know how to implement and fund EbA at scale.  

The paper is based on data collected from seven beneficiary projects in Garba Tulla and Kinna Wards, using focus group discussion and key informant interviews. The results show that although the projects are overly sectoral in their planning, both funding approaches strive to support local development and adaptation priorities as set out in the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) through greater involvement of local communities. Both funding approaches have significant potential in terms of scaling up support for adaptation, because they are participatory, cross-sectoral (especially the nationally managed fund), compatible with the governance and institutional structures that manage dryland ecosystems, and can operate at scale. The locally managed fund (i.e. ICCCF) responded better to community needs and had a shorter time period between proposal development and fund disbursement compared to the CDTF. Both funding approaches are implemented through informal governance structures parallel to but complementing the devolved county administration. Clear accountability and transparency measures existed in both approaches. Overall, ICCCF had enhanced targeting of community needs through resilience assessment studies, and shorter turn-around time between proposal development and fund disbursement compared to CDTF. In addition, the results indicate that project monitoring and supervision is more effective when funds are managed locally. CDTF had higher capitalization with average project budgets of more than tenfold that of ICCCF. It emerged that CDTF would potentially benefit from a pool of skills available at national level and was better placed to support initiatives stretching beyond a County boundary, which may work better in the context of management at the broader ecosystem level.  

Within the nature of Kenya’s devolved system, current funding approaches create parallel processes and potential sources of conflicts/duplication of functions. However, these challenges are being addressed under ICCCF thanks to the Climate Change Bill and the Natural Resources Management Bill that are currently before the county assembly. For local adaptation and development benefits to be realized, it is recommended that funding for public goods should embrace ecosystem-based planning and management, be more flexible in supporting community development priorities, strengthen sustainability criteria, be integrated into county planning and budgeting process, and build the capacity of those involved in the entire project cycle. This paper shows that in order for the local communities to benefit from resilience-building interventions; it is not only the amount of funding that matters but also the approach used to deliver them.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

**Families facing harsh winter temperatures**

“Winter is coming, it is getting cold and I do not know how to pay for firewood,” says Bibi Hawa, a returnee who left Pakistan four years ago and has since lived in one of Kabul’s informal settlements. She recently received US$33 to buy food from the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of winter assistance.

She and her six children survive on such humanitarian handouts and the little money she makes from selling the trash that her children collect in the streets. Bibi and her family are one of an estimated 78,000 families - more than half a million people - in need of humanitarian assistance to get through winter. 

**Families lack heaters, fuel, clothing and food.**

While temperatures have recently started to drop across the country, planning for winterisation started already as far back as June. As part of a coordinated approach led by the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations (MoRR), the humanitarian community developed a strategy to deliver winter support to people most in need. 

More than 3,000 internally displaced families have found shelter in districts classified as extreme winter areas based on the elevation and more than 15,000 displaced families are facing severe winter conditions. The highest number of families in need are estimated to be in Badakhshan, Bamyan, Daykundi and Kabul.

Based on humanitarian assessments, families selected for assistance all have low income, lack adequate clothing, many have no heater or fuel and nearly half of them say they plan to sleep in overcrowded rooms to survive the cold. As many expect to be forced to reduce the number of meals they eat per day. 

**Heating fuel for three months at the centre of assistance plan**

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as cluster lead of the Emergency Shelter/Non-Food Items Cluster (ES/NFI) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as co-chair, coordinate winterisation assistance with the authorities across the country.

At the centre of the joint winterisation plan is cash assistance of $200 per family to buy fuel to provide warmth during the three coldest months of the year. Cluster members who are part of the joint plan include the NGOs Adventist Development Relief Agency, CARE International, Islamic Relief, Save the Children, Welthungerhilfe and Mission East. IOM has also secured just over $188,000 towards the winterisation response.

UNHCR has committed to assisting 40,000 displaced, returnee and host community families with $9.5 million funding, working across the country with its partners. With separate funds, UNHCR and partners will support more than 13,000 refugee families from Pakistan and host communities with cash for heating fuel, blankets tarps and tents.

“For over a decade, UNHCR has coordinated and provided live-saving winter assistance to vulnerable Afghans,” said Fathiaa Abdalla, UNHCR Representative in Afghanistan. “Thanks to the continued donors’ support, nearly 300,000 people or 40,000 families will receive winter assistance under UNHCR’s winterisation efforts this year, however needs remain far greater.”

The Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Afghanistan, Toby Lanzer, is working with senior Afghan leadership in key line ministries, the European Union and other donors on securing the funding to cover the remaining gap of $7.6 million to reach all 78,000 families.

**Winter clothing, plastic sheeting, blankets, pneumonia kits and food**

In addition to the official joint winterization plan, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is planning to support 26,300 families with winter clothing, blankets and plastic sheeting with a grant of $3 million. The Health Cluster via the World Health Organization (WHO) is prepositioning pneumonia kits across the country so that hospitals can deal with the expected increase of pneumonia and respiratory diseases, often affecting children.  

WFP plans to support 9,500 households like Bibi Hawa’s in informal settlements in Kabul City with cash to buy food for three months and will provide food ration or cash to more than 57,000 families in other areas of the country.

2327719,"Why learning from failure is key to anticipating humanitarian crises **We failed this summer - let’s embrace it**

by Sarah Klassen

For the nervous flyers out there, it’s comforting to know that flying has become the safest form of travel. It’s safe because we’ve recorded and learned from past failures - all captured in black boxes which are a compulsory part of all commercial aircrafts. Matthew Syed writes about this in his book ‘Black Box Thinking’. Syed reminds us that breakthroughs always begin with multiple failures and that true success lies in capturing, understanding and overcoming these failures. I think he’s onto something.

The Start Network launched the [Crisis Anticipation Window](https://startnetwork.org/start-fund/crisis-anticipation-window) in November 2016. For the first time, the 42 humanitarian charities that make up this network can apply for funding - ahead of a potential crisis. Start members can use forecasting information to raise an alert to the network about an escalating risk of a crisis. This alert can trigger Start Funds which support projects to mitigate potential damage. This approach is pretty intuitive and so far we’ve seen a lot of [promising proactive aid interventions](https://startnetwork.org/news-and-blogs/crisis-anticipation-how-working-together-understand-risk-will-give-us-confidence-act). We are no longer just waiting and reacting to chaos after it unfolds -humanitarians are on the offensive.

But right now, I don’t want to focus on our successes. I want to look inside the black boxes that emerged over the summer, because there’s so much in them that’s key to breakthrough for our network moving forward. And there’s too much at stake to not learn from our past.

**NIGER**

On 13 July, Start members raised concerns about potential flooding in Niger and submitted an anticipation alert to the network. When decision makers were considering the alert, they knew that there was a real risk of flooding in the country and they knew that communities were vulnerable. But they were also (rightly) concerned that the alert only focused on one area in the country that already had a relatively high NGO and UN presence and funding. Although they could have expanded the geographic scope of the alert to focus on the most vulnerable areas, they felt that not enough information was provided about the needs and risks in other areas and so the alert wasn’t activated.

On the 26 of August, torrential rains arrived in Niger - as expected. Within a week, the rain had destroyed hundreds of homes in the capital, Niamey. Niamey lies along the Niger River, so it’s particularly vulnerable to flooding. Thousands of people were forced from their homes. According to Niger’s government, flooding killed at least 44 people in Niamey and other parts of the country. Frustratingly, one of the main causes of flooding was simply the obstruction of drainage canals. Clearing drainage canals is one of the projects that could have been funded if the alert was activated.

What’s in the black box: There’s a lot to learn from this experience. Uncertainty was the ultimate stumbling block here. As a network, if we’re going to be proactive, we need a greater appetite for risk. Anticipating crises always involves a greater level of uncertainty than responding to something in front of you. If there is a clear risk, decision-makers should be empowered to broaden the scope of alerts to the most vulnerable areas - even when faced with uncertainty. The ECHO funded Crisis Anticipation window is a welcomed opportunity for humanitarians to experiment with proactive responses and to learn from these experiences along the way.  

**SIERRA LEONE**

On 14 August, a mudslide linked to flooding killed more than 1000 people in Sierra Leone in a town called Regent on the outskirts of Freetown. The government initially pegged the death toll at 450, while rescuers warned that many of the more than 600 people still missing would likely not survive. It was a devastating and traumatic experience for the town’s residents. As funding often takes a while to arrive, the Start Network began responding rapidly to fill the critical gap immediately following the mudslide.

Storms and torrential downpours are common in Sierra Leone in August and September. Back in July, Start Members began talking about the escalating risk of flooding and landslides in the country. We knew that the risks were increasing. [Sierra Leone had seen 104cm of rain since 1 July](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Global%20Weather%20Hazard-17.07.27.pdf), which was three times more than expected during the rainy season according to the US National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center. We then discussed the potential flooding and landslides in Sierra Leone for two weeks. Many people in Regent live in informal settlements on steep hillsides. The country’s officials had warned against widespread unregulated construction on the hillsides. The uprooting of trees for construction on the hillside is also known to have made the soil particularly unstable and more vulnerable to collapse. The Sierra Leone metrological department didn’t issue a warning to hasten evacuations from the danger zones. As we were discussing and drafting the alert note, hundreds of people were killed.

What’s in the black box: It’s important to take a step back and reflect on this experience: How can we learn from this moving forward? When we know a risk is escalating, humanitarians need to act- and we need to act quickly. Natural disasters don’t work according to our timelines. When multiple agencies are concerned about an escalating risk, we need to make sure that this quickly translates into action.  If we’re uncertain about a risk- we can analyse it. The Start Network provides [a small grant for inter-agency risk analysis. It’s called the ‘Analysis for Action Grant](https://start-network.box.com/s/kt16gs5c8l1rj9stp4rz4eebfz2yb2dp)’ because when people come together to collectively analyse risk, they’re more likely to do something about it.

**HURRICANE IRMA**

You’ll have seen in the headlines that Irma was the most intense hurricane in the Atlantic since 2007. The category 5 storm caused widespread and catastrophic damage, particularly in parts of the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys. Irma developed on 30 August near the Cape Verde Islands. Shortly after, Start Network members who were actively monitoring the hurricane raised it to the network. Still facing uncertainly about the possible impacts and final path of the hurricane, members raised an anticipation alert to respond to the approaching hurricane on 6 September. It made landfall on the coast of Barbuda later that day, and continued along its path of destruction until the 11 September.

Discussions around the alert on 6 September were complex and difficult, but ultimately, the alert wasn’t activated. Decision makers felt that it was raised too late to implement activities that could mitigate harm and loss related to the hurricane and that the scale of the crisis was seen to be beyond the scope of the Start Fund. It was also rightly pointed out that other sources of funding would be made available. Agencies involved in the alert likely walked away from the experience discouraged. Anticipating hurricanes is a very tricky business.

What’s in the black box: Although the alert wasn’t activated, this experience was a huge step forward for the network. The Start Fund seeks to enable quick and proactive aid interventions. It’s important to remember that in 2015 and 2016, for a variety of different reasons, our members in the region have only been able to raise alerts for hurricanes no sooner than 9 days after the storm has hit landfall. This time they raised the alert in advance. We’re moving in the right direction. Earlier alert activations- even very close to storm landfall, will allow our members to begin their project proposals sooner. This means we reach impacted people sooner.

I share these black box reflections because I believe they capture the journey that we’re on as a network. Working to shift the humanitarian sector from a reactive to a proactive way of working happens in small, sometimes painful, steps. We need to recognise this journey and we’ve got to keep embracing and learning from our ‘failures’ in order to move forward.

Acting in anticipation of humanitarian crises is new for many agencies. It can be difficult to know when to trigger an alert and what projects can be the most effective. We have created guidance notes to help our members anticipate various hazards. This month we are releasing two new guidance notes: anticipating [disease outbreaks](https://startnetwork.org/resource/pre-alert-guidance-note-disease-outbreaks) and [tropical storms](https://startnetwork.org/resource/pre-alert-guidance-note-cyclones-hurricanes-typhoons).

2326904,"Member States briefing on the use and achievements of CERF in 2017 On 14 November 2017, Ms. Ursula Mueller the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator and Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), delivered a briefing to the United Nations Member States on the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).  His Excellency Mr. Negash Botora, Ambassador and the Permanent Representative of Ethiopia, and His Excellency Mr. Hans Brattskar, Ambassador and the Permanent Representative of Norway also took the floor to provide their perspectives on the fund, as a recipient of CERF funding and as donor to CERF, respectively.. The meeting was chaired by Rudi Mueller, the Head of OCHA in Geneva, and Ms. Lisa Doughten, Chief of the CERF Secretariat, provided insightful answers to the participants of the briefing. More than fifty participants including representatives from Member States, UN agencies and NGOs attended the briefing.  

Mr. Mueller welcomed the guests and participants to the event and opened with a video message from the Secretary-General, emphasizing the success of CERF and the importance of enhancing financial and political support to CERF, because “a strong United Nations needs a strong CERF”. Noting the role of CERF at the forefront of humanitarian action, Mr. Mueller highlighted that CERF has disbursed $5 billion since inception in 2006, and is renowned as one of the most effective ways to address the humanitarian challenges the world faces.

DERC Mueller provided an update on the use and management of the fund in 2017. As a fund ‘by all, for all’ with the support of 126 Member States and observers, she reiterated the SG’s message, highlighting CERF as a success for which all partners can take credit. The DERC focused on key CERF allocations such as the Rohingya crisis, which is currently the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis, Yemen, which has the largest number of people in need of urgent aid, the Caribbean islands, battered by successive hurricanes, among others to highlight the indispensable role of CERF in kickstarting urgent humanitarian response.  ‘An investment in CERF is an investment in the world’s most vulnerable people’, she said including CERF focus on people trapped in underfunded and protracted crisis. Reiterating the core features of CERF – global, fast, cost-effective, neutral and impartial – the DERC thanked Member States for their commitment to doubling CERF to $1 billion by 2018 and for their continued investments in the fund.

Ambassador Botora emphasized the importance of CERF to Ethiopia, which has benefited significantly from allocations through both the rapid response and underfunded windows, totaling about $280 million. He highlighted the timely disbursement and transparent allocation process of CERF in the successive drought responses. ‘Additional funding to bolster CERF is vital in light of the difference that CERF made to enable response to the effects of El Nino and other crises’, he said. While the government also allocated significant resources, the combined efforts of government and partners helped to avert a catastrophe. While still recovering from El Niño, the Horn of Africa was subsequently hit by climate change related drought and high food insecurity. Drought did not deteriorate to famine due to significant resources by the government at the cost of investing in development programmes. In addition, Ethiopia hosts one million refugees which further emphasizes the importance of increased support from CERF. He reinforced the endorsement of the United Nations General Assembly to expand CERF to $1 billion. To that end, he called upon all donors to help meet this target.

Ambassador Brattskar highlighted the key features of CERF – fast, global, flexible, neutral and impartial –and expressed Norway’s strong support to CERF. ‘CERF is one of the fastest and most efficient ways to deliver aid to millions of people in need’, he said, citing the success of famine prevention where CERF was among the first responders to the warning signs of potential famine. He also emphasized the role of CERF in promoting response based on shared prioritization by country teams on the ground. “The increasing scale and intensity of emergencies requires a larger, more robust CERF, fully-backed by its stakeholders”, he said and expressed Norway’s full support to the increase of CERF to $1 billion. He called on all Member States to join in providing strong financial support to CERF and to advocate with others for funding to CERF, especially in the lead up to the CERF High-Level Pledging Conference on 8 December 2017.

After the remarks, the floor was opened for discussion. Many participants thanked OCHA for the timely briefing and reiterated the need for more regular updates on CERF, including representatives from CERF recipient countries like Nigeria, Peru and Yemen. Yemen thanked for the support received from CERF and country-based pooled funds, and emphasized the importance of cash-based intervention. He pointed to cash-based programming as highly efficient, noting however that it was undermined with the collapse of the banking system, which restricted the transfer of funds to people in need.

Citing the donor results overview, Australia, Norway and Sweden thanked CERF for efforts to promote donor visibility, considered vital for donors’ advocacy with their parliaments and public. Peru emphasized CERF’s creative communication products, including the website to present data and information. In addition to CERF’s role as a global, flexible fund, enabling principled humanitarian aid, participants also emphasized the importance of CERF’s focus on underfunded crises and the importance of prioritization of needs. Switzerland expressed interest in exploring insurance and private sector investment. Other issues included the complementarity with country-based pooled funds as seen in the famine prevention response. Many representatives reiterated the need for enhance donor commitment to help meet the target of $1 billion.

The meeting ended with a call by Mr. Mueller reinforcing the value of CERF and encouraging Member States and other partners to ensure that the upcoming High-Level Pledging Conference is successful.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2323494,"EIB and CDB commit USD 24 million to post-disaster reconstruction in the Caribbean The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) have set up an emergency post-disaster reconstruction financing initiative to help the Region recover from recent hurricane events.

The arrangement will support investments for infrastructure reconstruction projects in the Caribbean in the wake of the recent hurricanes. The new USD 24 million financing package is an addition to the USD 120 million Climate Action Framework Loan II [signed](https://reliefweb.int/node/2045419) in May this year, and which remains the EIB’s biggest loan to the Caribbean.

Eligible investments under the new loan will include infrastructure reconstruction, with a focus on “building back better” and integrating climate risk and vulnerability assessments into the projects. This will help reduce the Bank’s Borrowing Member Countries’ vulnerability to future natural disasters and worsening climate change impacts. As well as infrastructure, financing to communities for low-carbon and climate-resilience measures such as improved water resource management are also foreseen.

CDB President Wm. Warren Smith and EIB Vice President responsible for Climate Action, Jonathan Taylor, signed the new agreement during the [UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23)](https://cop23.com.fj/) in Bonn, Germany. Small Island Developing States is a key theme for the event this year under the Fijian Presidency. Against this backdrop, CDB and EIB presented innovative solutions to climate challenges during an event focusing on climate action in the Caribbean, attended by the Prime Minister of Grenada, Dr. the Rt. Hon. Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, Hon. Allen Chastanet and other stakeholders.

Jonathan Taylor, EIB Vice President said: “In response to the devastation caused by hurricanes in the region in recent weeks, the EIB and CDB rapidly agreed to commit additional resources to support reconstruction investment projects in the Caribbean. The USD 24 million post-hurricane reconstruction initiative comes in addition to the USD 120 million loan to CDB for financing climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience projects which we signed earlier this year. We stand committed to developing our fruitful 40 year partnership with CDB, to support climate-resilient projects in the Caribbean and to help to adequately tackle the challenges related to climate change. 

CDB President Wm. Warren Smith said: “The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most devastating the Caribbean has ever experienced, and underscored the urgent need for investment in climate-resilient infrastructure in our region. The signing of this agreement is another milestone in our longstanding partnership with EIB, and will facilitate CDB’s increased support for resilient reconstruction in the Caribbean. We remain committed to work with our partners to mobilise resources needed to ‘build back better’ and, despite the recent setbacks, help the most vulnerable countries of our region to remain focused on meeting their goals for sustainable development.”

To date, CDB has committed all of the resources under the first Climate Action Line of Credit – USD 65.6 million – for seven projects. This co-financing is associated with total project financing of USD 191 million.

Since CDB’s Climate Resilience Strategy was approved in 2012, 58% of projects financed have included climate change adaptation and/or mitigation elements in the climate-sensitive sectors of water, education, agriculture, and physical infrastructure such as sea defences, drainage, and roads. Using the Joint Multilateral Development Bank Methodology, climate financing represented 13% of total CDB project financing in 2015. In 2016, CDB approved USD 50 million for projects with explicit climate resilience and sustainable energy actions.

A pipeline of climate action projects amounting to over USD 300 million and which may be eligible for funding from this new loan has been developed with financing of an EIB-funded technical assistance programme.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

2319274,"Living up to the promise of multi-year humanitarian financing **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Multi-year humanitarian financing (MYHF) is widely assumed to bring with it a variety of benefits.  
However, such benefits have rarely been tested beyond theoretical conjecture. This study explores when and where MYHF can have the greatest effect, as well as identifying the investments and enabling conditions required at the organisational and systemic levels for it to live up to its potential. The research also points towards the challenges that humanitarian actors now face in building a more predictable and responsive humanitarian system, as well as identifying a set of new and emerging challenges related to the Agenda 2030 commitments.

**The longstanding demand from humanitarian organisations for MYHF has been endorsed in the Grand Bargain, but a new set of practical challenges must now be tackled.** More progress has been made against the commitment to increase MYHF than on many other commitments included in the Grand Bargain (GPPI, 2017). However, having finally made the case for MYHF, donors and responding organisations are now beginning to grapple with a second generation of challenges. These centre on how MYHF can truly enable greater efficiency and effectiveness, and what investments and upgrades are needed for it to realise its full potential. Multi-year financing in its current form is necessary, but is not sufficient to secure the potential gains of longer-term approaches. And while it offers many potential benefits at the project and programme levels, a far more radical approach to financing is needed to drive substantial efficiency and effectiveness gains at the system level.

**A further set of challenges for MYHF is emerging, posed by new global policy commitments and paradigms.** The UN Secretary-General’s 2015 Agenda for Humanity identifies multi-year planning and financing as an enabling condition to work towards “collective outcomes” designed to “end needs”.  
Multi-year approaches have consequently been framed not simply as a means of making humanitarian response more efficient and more effective, but as a tool to help bring together actors across the humanitarian–development–peacebuilding nexus (HDPN) to work towards longer-term transformative change. 

This new agenda poses a range of challenges above and beyond improving the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian response. In many cases the way forward is not yet clear, and it will require investments in evidence and dialogue to chart a path that protects and supports the comparative advantages of principled humanitarian action.

Key lessons emerging from this study include the following.

LESSON 1:

**Predictable and flexible humanitarian financing enables early and rapid response, which delivers significant efficiency and effectiveness gains.**

There is significant evidence confirming MYHF contributes to efficiency and effectiveness gains for early and rapid response, including in slow-onset crises where mobilising financing is otherwise notoriously difficult. Providing predictable and flexible financing to improve preparedness, along with early and rapid response, is an important and well-evidenced end in itself.

 LESSON 2:

**Cost-efficiency savings and value-for-money gains are not automatic: they need to be targeted with precision, designed, and managed for.**

With the notable exception of reduced proposal development and administrative transaction costs, there is little evidence to indicate that MYHF alone has delivered significant cost savings, and cost inefficiencies are often in reality driven by multiple factors. Cost-efficiency savings are unlikely to happen by chance: inefficiencies should be clearly diagnosed and strategies developed to address them. Longerterm approaches can enable longer-term returns on investment, but identifying and targeting investments requires new approaches to assessing the returns on investment and a new level of discipline in response design. 

 LESSON 3:

**Flexibility is key to reinforcing the gains of increased financing predictability, but balancing predictability and flexibility is a delicate art.**

Managing multi-year financing in a way that allows flexibility is a clear and consistent priority for responding organisations. Humanitarian organisations and donors are only just beginning to get to grips with the need for a new and different approach to programme management to handle this. Meanwhile, donors face contradictory pressures in balancing predictability and flexibility at the global portfolio level. 

LESSON 4:

**Responding organisations and system-level tools are not yet engineered to deliver multiyear approaches.**

Building a humanitarian system that can analyse, plan, respond and learn with a view to longer-term outcomes will require investments in skills, culture and institutional incentives as well as tools and systems. Organisations that already have development programmes and larger, better-resourced agencies in general are better equipped and able to invest. Smaller organisations and those with limited access to flexible and longer-term funding may need additional support from donors to invest in system upgrades. 

LESSON 5:

**MYHF has not yet reached the critical mass necessary to drive transformative systemlevel change, and the benefits are spread unevenly.**

MYHF still represents a relatively small proportion of total humanitarian funding and has not yet reached the critical mass necessary to shift incentives and drive transformative change. The benefits of such funding also accrue unevenly across the humanitarian response system. In particular, recipients of MYHF are not routinely transferring the benefits of such funding negotiated at the global level to country programmes, and they rarely provide MYHF to their own implementing partners.

LESSON 6:

**MYHF is an important step forward, but it does not address deeper structural financing challenges.**

MYHF provides greater predictability primarily at the project and programme levels; it does not address challenges of system-level liquidity or business continuity. Creative approaches to analysing financing needs and designing financing instruments, including market-based instruments to mobilise private capital, could help to drive major transformative changes in business models and programming approaches, and bring substantial efficiency and effectiveness benefits. These approaches have yet to be seriously considered or tested at scale.

LESSON 7:

**MYHF supports and enables a range of longer-term approaches, but evidence confirming the case for transformative outcomes is sparse.**

A broad range of programming activities would benefit in principle from greater predictability and longer planning horizons – for example, strengthening systems and capacities or influencing behaviour change, and activities which span calendar years, such as seasonally sensitive programming. But while there are some promising indications, there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm that transformative outcomes are being achieved. There are clear indications that in the absence of additional supporting investments to address structural risk and vulnerability, and given the scale of the challenges, the impact of humanitarian investments on transforming underlying vulnerability is modest at best. In addition, measuring change in complex problems and attributing the contribution of international investments in low-resource, crisis-affected or insecure settings is immensely challenging and may require new approaches to measurement and the acceptance of new types of evidence.

 LESSON 8:

**In protracted and recurrent crises, planning for “collective outcomes” may offer new opportunities in longer-term planning, but it may also pose a range of challenges for existing humanitarian tools and approaches.**

Experiments in collective multi-year planning have encountered a range of practical challenges, and on balance initiatives have yet to meet the expectations, or the information and coordination needs, of their primary users. Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs) are constrained by legacy structures and tools, which act as a brake on their ability to work for longer-term outcomes. For instance, humanitarian response has been predicated on assessment, analysis and prioritisation of needs, whereas longer-term approaches also require an understanding of the root causes of vulnerability and risk. Working towards collective outcomes offers the promise of a clear conceptual framework and division of labour across the HDPN on a limited set of priority issues, but it will also further challenge existing planning, budgeting and fundraising approaches.

LESSON 9:

**Financing tools and the financing architecture at the country level do not yet match aspirations to work towards collective outcomes across the HDPN.**

Most MYHF is provided though bilateral agreements with UN and INGO partners, which are often negotiated at the headquarters level. Existing country-level humanitarian financing instruments, designed to incentivise a coordinated approach and rational coverage of financing needs, are not designed to accommodate multi-year approaches. Some hybrid instruments are emerging, but there is no clear strategy and no tools to focus MYHF towards priority financing needs as part of a coherent financing response at the crisis level.

 LESSON 10:

**Extending humanitarian action into the HDPN without commensurate effort from development financing actors risks creating a moral hazard and putting further pressure on scarce humanitarian resources.**

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are driving a substantial scale-up in engagement of development financing actors in at-risk and crisis-affected settings. However, funding flows have yet to catch up with policy commitments and aspirations, and in many settings there is still a chronic lack of flexible and risk-tolerant development financing.  
Humanitarian actors have a critical role to play in advocating for and influencing the prioritisation and targeting of development financing, to ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind and to protect scarce humanitarian resources from being stretched beyond the scope of their competence and remit.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

The following is a summary of recommendations intended to address key emerging gaps and challenges. Expanded discussion of the recommendations is included in the main part of the report. Many more challenges and opportunities are yet to emerge, however, and thus the humanitarian and development community is likely to be on the brink of a dynamic and creative period of significant learning and innovation.

* Recommendation 1: Treat MYHF as an investment that is targeted, designed and managed to deliver the greatest returns.

* Recommendation 2: Invest in learning what works and in ways to loop this back into adaptive programming and building the case for MYHF.

* Recommendation 3: Invest in institutional capacities to analyse, plan, design and monitor on a multi-year basis and to manage activities flexibly.

* Recommendation 4: Apply greater scrutiny to current practices, issues and disincentives to conferring the benefits of MYHF through all levels of the response system.

* Recommendation 5: Design for and invest in building financing predictability at the system level.

* Recommendation 6: Design new financing tools and architecture at the country level which incentivise and enable layered, sequenced collaborative financing support across the HDPN in support of collective outcomes.

* Recommendation 7: Engage with other change processes across the HDPN to ensure a coherent financing response, while clearly articulating the comparative advantages and limits of action financed from humanitarian budgets.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

**Empowering communities to help themselves**

In May 2017 UNFPA with the Pakistan Humanitarian Pooled Fund (PHPF) began supporting the FATA Health Department and its field units in Kurram Agency, helping two overburdened health facilities in Sadda and Alizai lower Kurram to provide female health workers with reproductive health supplies, safe delivery kits and new-born baby kits.

The goal of the project is to increase the access of women and girl returnees to critical time sensitive reproductive health services and information. This includes services such as skilled deployment and training of skilled birth attendants, basic emergency obstetric care, birth spacing, psychosocial support services and medical referrals. Women with complicated obstetric cases were referred to the Government and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) health facilities.

During the emergency situation in Kurram Agency, the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital and many basic health units were partially or completely destroyed.  Some 41,000 families have returned to hilly areas with little or no transport facilities nor access to healthcare services.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

The appeals are funded at $11.8 billion, leaving a shortfall of $12.3 billion. This is $1.5 billion less than the gap reported at the end of September 2017.  

The current humanitarian situation in **DRC** far exceeds planning scenarios for 2017, with huge additional needs in areas with limited pre-existing response capacity, most notably in the Kasai region. The overall number of people in need in DRC has increased from 7.3 million to more than 8.5 million since the beginning of the year, and there are currently 3.9 million internally displaced people in the country, as well as half a million refugees. Food insecurity is a critical concern, with 1.5 million people in IPC Phase 4. Current estimates may even understate the level of need, while HRP funding is at its lowest level in ten years.  

Over 815,000 **Rohingya refugees**, including more than 600,000 who have arrived over the last two months, are sheltering in **Bangladesh**, making this the world’s fastest-growing refugee crisis. In October, partners released a $434 million response plan targeting 1.2 million people through February 2018. At a pledging conference on 23 October co-hosted by the State of Kuwait and the European Union and organized by IOM, UNHCR and OCHA, donors pledged $360 million for response to the Rohingya crisis. Partners are working to ensure that disbursements are fast-tracked. 

**Chad** hosts over 400,000 refugees and 100,000 internally displaced people in need of immediate assistance. The country suffers from massive food insecurity, with close to 1 million people severely food-insecure during the ongoing lean season. Additional funding is urgently required to save the lives and livelihoods of 2.6 million people in Chad by providing food, basic health, and safe water and sanitation as well as strengthening the protection of displaced women and children.
  
As of 27 October, the **Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)** has approved $414 million in grants for 35 countries. In October, the fund allocated $64 million to 8 countries, four of which were funded through the CERF’s underfunded emergencies window. Amongst the allocations was $12 million to cover the protection, WASH and health needs of 196,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and $13 million to support the response to the hurricanes in the **Caribbean**. For 2017, 45 donors have contributed a total of $447.1 million to CERF, and 5 other donors have pledged an additional $8.7 million; CERF is therefore projecting an income of $456.3 million for 2017.  

As of end October, 26 donors have contributed $599 million (including $16.8 million in pledges) to the 18 **country-based pooled funds (CBPFs)** active in 2017. The CBPFs in turn have channelled a combined $474 million to over 500 humanitarian partners, and proposals for a further $126 million are under review.

2317254,"Operational Handbook for Country-based Pooled Funds (Version 1.2), October 2017 **1. Introduction**

*1.1 Introduction*

1\. Country-based Pooled Funds (CBPFs) are multi-donor humanitarian financing instruments established by the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) and managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) at the country level under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator (HC). While OCHA has managed humanitarian pooled funds at the country level since 1995, CBPFs are rooted in the 2005 Humanitarian Reform and the Secretary-General’s report “In larger freedom”, which calls for predictable and flexible humanitarian funding to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.

2\. CBPFs are critical tools to support the delivery of the OCHA’s humanitarian coordination mandate. They receive un-earmarked funding from donors and allocate it in response to priority humanitarian needs through joint planning and an inclusive and field-driven decision-making process. OCHA’s approach to the management of CBPFs is anchored in the principles of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Transformative Agenda, which stresses the importance of providing predictable, timely and consistent resources towards principled humanitarian action. This approach is reinforced in the 2014-17 OCHA Strategic Framework, which highlights the role of CBPFs in promoting timely and un-earmarked funding allocated based on priority needs. The Strategic Framework calls for the use of CBPFs to enhance coordination and complementarity among humanitarian financing mechanisms. CBPFs promote diversity and partnership by supporting a variety of humanitarian actors, including national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with the resources they need to contribute to humanitarian response operations, and by engaging them in the governance and management of CBPFs.

3\. CBPFs promote coordinated humanitarian response through their close alignment to the Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC) . Harmonized CBPF processes and tools aim at making the mechanisms more effective and efficient in supporting the implementation of the Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs).

4\. CBPFs also enhance resource mobilization efforts and make more resources available for humanitarian response activities prioritized under the HRP.

5\. The CBPF Operational Handbook (hereinafter referred to as the Handbook) sets the minimum global standards for effective and efficient management of CBPFs. The Handbook responds to the need for standardized management arrangements and builds upon the vast experience gained by OCHA over the years in managing CBPFs in different country contexts.

*1.2 Purpose and scope of the Handbook*

6\. The purpose of the Handbook is to ensure a coherent approach to the strategic and operational management of all CBPFs. The Handbook defines management arrangements that enhance quality and accountability to UN Member States, donors, beneficiaries, and humanitarian partners, including those receiving CBPF grants.

7\. The Handbook elaborates the OCHA Policy Instruction on CBPFs, which describes the objectives, management and governance arrangements for all OCHA-managed CBPFs. The Handbook contains a set of annexes developed to guide and support OCHA Country Offices in the management of CBPFs.

8\. The primary audience for this Handbook are OCHA Country Offices and, in particular, the Humanitarian Financing Units (HFUs) that support and administer the CBPFs. The Handbook provides a set of processes and tools to provide guidance in the management of CBPFs and serve as minimum standards.  
OCHA Country Offices should build upon these minimum standards to ensure that the use and management of each fund meet the requirements of their context in which they are used.

9\. The Handbook describes the roles and responsibilities of HCs, OCHA, UN agencies, NGOs5 , clusters and other stakeholders when engaging in the operation of CBPFs.

10\. CBPFs are humanitarian financing instruments managed at the country level. They operate in different contexts and respond to a broad range of crises. CBPFs should be therefore flexible and adapted to local contexts.

11\. This Handbook presents additional technical guidance, processes and tools that must be adopted by each CBPF as minimum standards. While funds are required to comply with this Handbook, they retain the flexibility to build upon the requirements and adopt additional mechanisms that allow better responsiveness to each country context. 

12\. The processes and procedures described in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 should be further spelled out in a country specific “Operational Manual” (Annex 1, CBPF Operational Manual Template) prepared for each CBPF.  While the minimum parameters described in this Handbook must be adhered to, each CBPF has to define the specific arrangements necessary to work in a given country context. This includes membership of governance bodies; specific steps in the allocation process; and the accountability framework, including procedures for capacity assessment, risk management and monitoring.

13\. This Handbook is subject to periodic reviews. An assessment of the implementation of the Handbook will be carried out in 2021. In order to allow for flexibility and efficiency in the management of CBPFs, the annexed templates can be modified more frequently should this be deemed necessary",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

2312394,"‘Epic’ Humanitarian Crisis Looms Should Palestine Refugee Agency Be Compelled to Scale Back Services, Delegates Warn as Fourth Committee Debate Continues GA/SPD/654

General Assembly   
Fourth Committee   
Seventy-second Session, 25th Meeting (AM)

Urging broader support for new financing mechanisms, delegates warned today of a humanitarian crisis should the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) be forced to scale back services because of a financing deficit, as the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) concluded its general debate on that Agency’s work.

Turkey’s representative recalled the broad consultation process that had animated discussions on ensuring predictable, sufficient and sustainable funding for the Agency.  If implemented by each relevant stakeholder, the recommendations could ensure continuity for UNRWA’s services and end its recurrent and severe financing shortfalls.  Welcoming the establishment of new funding mechanisms in partnership with international financial institutions, he said Turkey had dedicated $100,000 towards efforts to materialize those new streams.  While other members of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) had also taken steps in that regard, support from the broader United Nations membership would be vital to realizing concrete results on that track, he added.

Echoing the concerns about UNRWA’S financing, Sri Lanka’s representative cautioned that, if underfunded or without reserves, the Agency would be overtaken by a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions that would threaten its good works and services.  Moreover, the ongoing violence in Syria had created large-scale movements of people, further complicating the Agency’s work and placing an added burden on its depleted finances.

Syria’s representative stressed that no effort would be spared to protect Palestine refugees within his country’s territory, despite attacks committed by armed terrorist groups against them and against Syrians.  Recalling that UNRWA had repeatedly stated its inability to provide assistance to the Yarmouk refugee camp due to the actions of armed terrorists, he stressed that those committing them were the same groups targeting Palestinians with a view to eliminating their right to return to their homeland.  He rejected the option of cancelling UNRWA services despite the unique pressures exerted on the countries hosting the Agency’s operations.

Lebanon’s representative said his country hosted more than 400,000 Palestinian refugees, many of whom faced economic, social, environmental and security challenges.  However, the Agency’s role had been jeopardized in recent years by its recurring financial deficit, coupled with the growing Palestine refugee population.  Israel’s actions in the occupied territories had exacerbated the situation, negatively affecting the quality of UNRWA’s services to hundreds of thousands of Palestine refugees, he noted.

Israel’s representative emphasized that it was unacceptable for a United Nations agency actively to support the agenda of one side of a conflict, saying UNRWA had again failed to uphold the standard of balanced reporting and neutrality during the current reporting period.  Although Hamas played a destructive role in the Gaza Strip, the Agency’s latest report hardly mentioned the group, he noted.  As for the refugee question, he said it had not yet been agreed, stressing that it could only be resolved as part of a bilateral negotiation between the Israeli and Palestinian sides.

In that context, the Permanent Observer for the Holy See expressed grave concern over recent attempts to move away from a two‑State solution, cautioning that inflammatory rhetoric and straying from the Madrid and Oslo Accords had increased the Palestinian people’s desperation.  Resolving the Palestinian question would have a beneficial cascading effect on other crises in the region, thus allowing UNRWA to enjoy a well-deserved retirement, he said.

Cuba’s representative emphasized that UNRWA must be funded from the regular United Nations budget, rejecting the actions of certain States that had threatened to withdraw their support for purely political reasons.  The Agency’s basic programmes must be protected until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was resolved, he stressed, saying Cuba would continue to support a comprehensive settlement based on a two‑State solution.

Other speakers today included representatives of Namibia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, Maldives, Norway, South Africa, Venezuela, Iraq, Brazil, Malaysia, Kuwait, Algeria, Ecuador, Tunisia, Russian Federation, United Arab Emirates, China and Indonesia.

The Commissioner-General of UNRWA delivered concluding remarks.

The Fourth Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 7 November, to begin its general debate on Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories.

**General Debate**

NEVILLE MELVIN GERTZE (Namibia) said his country recognized the significant steps taken by the Commissioner-General and United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to strengthen financial control and budgetary regulation.  However, the Agency’s programme budget still had a $126.5 million shortfall amounting to two months of operational costs.  Over the past two years, funding had not kept pace with the number of refugees, he noted, stressing that Palestine refugees were expected to number 6.4 million by 2020.  Today, 5.3 million Palestinians comprised one quarter of refugees around the world, he said, calling upon Israel to cease all settlement construction in the occupied territories and to stop destroying Palestinian homes and infrastructure.

MOUNZER MOUNZER (Syria), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, said more than 5 million Palestine refugees had been forcibly displaced from their homeland by the racist, settler Israeli occupation, in violation of their most basic rights.  In spite of the targeting of its workers and facilities, however, UNRWA continued to play an important role, adding that the countries hosting it were also donors assisting the Agency and thereby enduring unique pressures.  As such, Syria provided assistance to the refugees, treating them like Syrians without any distinction, he said, recalling that the Commissioner-General had been informed of that during his visit to Damascus.  No effort would be spared to protect Palestine refugees on Syrian territory, despite the attacks committed by armed terrorist groups against them and against Syrians, he emphasized.

He went on to recall that the Yarmouk refugee camp, invaded by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) and others, had been besieged, with its inhabitants used as human shields and denied humanitarian aid.  On 26 August, terrorists had prevented secondary school students from travelling to Damascus to write exams, he said, adding that they had continued to prevent all students from attending school since September.  UNRWA had repeatedly stated its inability to provide Yarmouk with assistance due to the actions of armed terrorists, he said, stressing that those committing them were the same groups targeting Palestinians with a view to eliminating their right to return to their homeland.  He underlined the importance of donors providing assistance to UNRWA in a predictable manner, rejecting the option of cancelling services to Palestine refugees, which would constitute a violation of international law.

AHMED ELSHANDAWILY (Egypt) stressed the importance of UNRWA’s education services for Palestine refugees, emphasizing that it was free from radical ideologies seeking to poison young minds.  He also pointed to the Agency’s continuing financial crisis, saying it warranted the international community’s full attention, as funding challenges continued to impede its ability to discharge its mandate and responsibilities towards refugees.  That obstacle had been exacerbated by severe conditions in the Middle East.  As hosting States struggled with burdens exceeding the Agency’s budget several times over, it was impossible to expect them to incur additional responsibilities, he said.

HUMBERTO RIVERO ROSARIO (Cuba), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, noted that UNRWA had been able to provide human development services and humanitarian relief with speed and efficiency despite the operational shortfall.  However, Cuba was concerned about the Agency’s critical financial situation, he said, emphasizing that it must be able to maintain its financial allocation.  UNRWA must be funded from the regular United Nations budget, he said, rejecting the actions of certain States that did not support the funding allocation and had threatened to withdraw their support for purely political reasons.  The Agency’s basic needs programmes must be protected until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was resolved, he stressed, saying Cuba would continue to support a comprehensive settlement on the basis of a two‑State solution.

TAREQ MD ARIFUL ISLAM (Bangladesh), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, emphasized the importance of strengthening the Agency’s capacity to fulfil its humanitarian and human development mandates.  Expressing concern about the safety of UNRWA’s staff, he noted that 30 personnel had been killed and 26 were missing.  There could be no justification for the killing and abduction of United Nations staff, or for the wanton destruction of emergency shelters, homes, schools and civilian infrastructure, he stressed.  Noting that the shortfall in UNRWA’s regular programme budget had risen to $126 million, he said the dire situation had forced the Agency to take a loan for the first time in its history.  Recalling the influx of hundreds of thousands of forcibly displaced Rohingya from Myanmar into Bangladesh, he reaffirmed his country’s solidarity with Palestine refugees around the world.

OLIVIER MARC ZEHNDER (Switzerland) expressed concern about the Palestine refugees who continued to face a protection crisis.  UNRWA provided 5.3 million Palestine refugees with services and protection, but the Agency continued to face a significant funding shortfall.  Thus, he called for the swift implementation of the Secretary-General’s recommendations to ensure a stable funding base for the duration of its mandate.  For its part, Switzerland would help to fund the Agency’s resource mobilization strategy and programme budget.  Switzerland would also undertake a multiyear contribution to ensure the Agency would have greater flexibility to carry out its mandate.

SHAHIR ALKHANINY (Saudi Arabia) said his country was one of UNRWA’s main donors, having provided more than $51 million in 2017 towards a number of projects in health, education and other sectors.  It had also pledged $37 million towards projects planned for 2018 and had been an active member of the Agency’s Advisory Commission since 2005.  However, UNRWA was still facing a financial shortfall, he said, noting that it faced an even graver situation than that of 2016.  In that regard, Saudi Arabia welcomed the recommendations emanating from the Advisory Commission’s consultations, he said, adding that he looked forward to the adoption of a General Assembly resolution on predictable and sustained financing for UNRWA from the regular United Nations budget.  There had been wide support for that text, exemplifying the commitment of Member States to relieving the plight of Palestine refugees, he said.  Saudi Arabia renewed its call for the international community to provide UNRWA with support, and for donors to redouble their efforts so the Agency could finance its programmes and the influx of Palestine refugees, he said.  Moreover, the root causes of the crisis must be addressed and the Israeli occupation of Palestinian and all other occupied Arab territories ended.

HASSAN ABBAS (Lebanon) said UNRWA had played a stabilizing role for more than 5.3 million Palestine refugees by providing education and health-care services.  Nevertheless, the Agency’s role had been jeopardized in recent years by its recurring financial deficit, coupled with the growing Palestine refugee population.  The situation had been exacerbated by Israel’s actions in the occupied territories, which had negatively impacted the quality of UNRWA’s services to hundreds of thousands of Palestine refugees, he noted.

He went on to note that Lebanon was the host to more than 400,000 Palestine refugees, many of whom faced economic, social, environmental and security challenges.  Despite its limited capabilities, the country had taken measures to alleviate some of those challenges, he said, recalling that in June 2005, the Ministry of Labour had granted Palestine refugees access to some 70 professions previously reserved for Lebanese nationals.  Furthermore, Parliament had adopted a law granting additional rights to Palestinian workers in the country, he added.

SONALI SAMARASINGHE (Sri Lanka), associating herself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, emphasized that UNRWA’s maintenance of schools and education infrastructure in the occupied territories was crucial in ensuring that children and youth turned away from violence and in inspiring them to hope for the future.  Half a million students were enrolled in the Agency’s 702 schools, which had achieved full gender balance as well as one of the highest literacy rates in the Middle East.  The ongoing violence in Syria had created large-scale movements of people, further complicating the Agency’s work, she said, adding that it had placed an added burden on UNRWA’s depleted finances.  As such, the principle of non‑refoulement must be honoured in relation to Palestine refugees fleeing the conflict, she said, emphasizing that, in accordance with international law, there must be no discrimination against them.  Sri Lanka was deeply concerned about UNRWA’s precarious financial situation, she said, cautioning that the Agency, if underfunded or without reserves, would be overtaken by a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions that would threaten its good works and services.  The lack of funding and consequent drawing down or hindrance of UNRWA’s work would pose a serious threat to international peace and security in an area of volatility and conflict, she warned.

KAZUFUMI AOKI (Japan) stressed that the financial crisis affecting Palestine refugees must not be forgotten, although conflicts and humanitarian needs in the Middle East had grown.  Japan was a staunch supporter of UNRWA’s efforts and recognized the difficulties of its unpredictable funding.  However, he urged the Agency to operate within the boundaries of voluntary contributions by United Nations donors, emphasizing that UNRWA must continue its outreach work to potential donors, including private ones like the Palestinian diaspora, for example.

DAVID YARDLEY (Australia) said his country supported continued efforts to pursue alternative funding and broaden UNRWA’s donor base.  Noting that the draft resolution on a potential future funding model had been withdrawn in July, he said he did not believe that seeking assessed contributions from the regular United Nations budget was a sustainable funding option for the Agency.  Emphasizing the critical importance of neutrality to UNRWA’s operations, he said the discovery of tunnels under its schools illustrated the need for continued vigilance on the Agency’s part.  Australia was committed to a lasting political settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two‑State solution within internationally recognized borders, he reiterated.

BENJAMIN KRASNA (Israel) said UNRWA often chose to promote a controversial political agenda instead of focusing on relief and humanitarian assistance.  That was the case with its proactive campaigns in support of the so‑called right of return for millions of Palestinians.  Noting that the refugee question had not yet been agreed, he emphasized that it could only be resolved as part of a bilateral negotiation between the parties.  It was unacceptable for a United Nations agency to actively support the agenda of one side of a conflict, he emphasized, noting that UNRWA had again failed to uphold the standard of balanced reporting and neutrality during the current reporting period.  Israel demanded impartial, frequent and thorough reporting of realities on the ground, he stressed.

He went on to point out that although Hamas played a destructive role in Gaza, it was barely mentioned in the Agency’s report.  He recalled the recent discovery of a tunnel beneath an UNRWA school, warning that such activities placed the school, Agency workers as well as children in great danger.  He asked UNRWA what steps were being taken proactively to ensure that tunnels were not dug under other Agency facilities in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere.  Also, UNRWA’s employment of active Hamas members must be condemned, he said, adding that the group continued to arm itself and to call for Israel’s destruction.

While Hamas was doing everything to hinder reconstruction, Israel was working with UNRWA and the international community to support rebuilding efforts in Gaza, he said.  Too often, humanitarian shipments had been used in the smuggling of illicit materials for Hamas and other terror groups.  Despite such challenges, however, Israel had been facilitating the enclave’s reconstruction, including through the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, thereby enabling the shipment of more than 8 million tons of building materials, he said, voicing dismay that the latest report scarcely mentioned the extensive cooperation between UNRWA and the Government of Israel.

ALI NASEER MOHAMED (Maldives) said UNRWA had become indispensable in protecting the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people by providing them with humanitarian assistance.  Because financing uncertainty challenged the Agency’s ability to deliver to people in need, it was crucial to ensure predictable, sustainable and sufficient funding.  In violation of the Geneva Conventions, the occupying Power had hindered the Agency’s efforts to deliver emergency humanitarian aid, he noted, raising concern about the increase in forced displacement in the West Bank.  Israel should end its unlawful settlement activities and the illegal occupation, he said.

TORE HATTREM (Norway), urging Israelis and Palestinians to resume credible negotiations towards peace, affirmed that protecting the rights of Palestine refugees was crucial to that effort.  Commending UNRWA’s work in that regard, he also recognized the key support role played by host countries.  He expressed concern, however, over the Agency’s financial situation and hope that the Secretary-General’s follow-up report would help remediate the problem.  Endorsing the recommendation to increase assessed contributions, he called for exploring ways to provide more support from the regular United Nations budget for costs beyond international staffing.  Acknowledging UNRWA’s need to constantly adapt to the region’s changing reality, he welcomed the priority of supporting the most vulnerable refugees.  He also recognized efforts to expand the donor base, reaffirming Norway’s commitment to support UNRWA in delivering core services in all five fields of operations.

WOUTER HOFMEYR ZAAYMAN (South Africa), paying tribute to UNRWA, said the continued poverty and suppression of Palestine refugees with no end in sight made its work even more urgent.  There was an obligation for Member States to ensure that the humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees were met.  Affirming the need for a just political settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he called for an end to Israel’s settlement activity — saying it obstructed the peace process — the lifting of the Gaza blockade, and the bridging of UNRWA’s financial gap.  South Africa would continue to support the Agency, in addition to supporting Palestinians through other mechanisms, he confirmed, while endorsing the Secretary-General’s recommendations to ensure sufficient, sustainable and predictable funding.  South Africa would also work through the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) to ensure a larger allocation from the regular United Nations budget, and seek additional funding through financial institutions, he pledged.

DOUGLAS NICOMEDES ARCIA VIVAS (Venezuela), said it was vital that UNRWA received the support it needed to deal with the deteriorating situation of Palestine refugees.  The Israeli occupation had exacerbated their living conditions, thereby increasing their need for basic services provided by the Agency.  The occupying Power had also prevented development on Palestinian land, further condemning the Palestinian population to poverty and reliance on outside support, he noted.  Those humanitarian problems were inevitably linked to the outstanding need for a political solution, he said, emphasizing that without a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, everything else, including UNRWA’s efforts, was just a palliative.  Venezuela rejected the construction of Israeli settlements, including in East Jerusalem, which only contributed to growing refugee numbers, he said, adding that the blockade constituted a clear violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.  Despite the situation, UNRWA had adopted financial reforms and continued to provide efficient service, he said, expressing indignation over its continuing budget problems.  How could the occupying Power ask the Agency for neutrality when its own actions were in violation of international law?  He called upon the international community to support, without conditions, the draft resolution on guaranteeing a budget for the functioning of UNRWA.

AHMED N. AL-SAHHAF (Iraq), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, expressed his delegation’s strong support for predictable UNRWA funding.  At a time of unprecedented violence and suffering in the region, Iraq commended the Commissioner-General’s tireless efforts to focus on developing the local economy and the means for Palestine refugees to enjoy a dignified life through partnership with other organizations.  As for the Agency’s ongoing financial crisis, he said it would threaten UNRWA’s ability to provide services to refugees, thus increasing the level of insecurity experienced by an already fragile population.  Member States must take the necessary measures to bring stability to UNRWA through voluntary financing, expansion of the donor base, and allocations from the regular United Nations budget, he said.  In closing, he emphasized the importance of a just and lasting political solution to the question of Palestine, saying his country was ready to participate constructively in efforts to support the Agency and the vulnerable population it served.

MAURO VIEIRA (Brazil) said that, as a member of UNRWA’s Advisory Committee, his country fully supported its activities.  Besides providing basic services, the Agency generated employment and offered microfinance to refugee communities, thereby fostering local economic development and promoting stability in a volatile region.  Regarding the Agency’s budgetary crisis, he reiterated Brazil’s proposal to have UNRWA’s budget absorbed by the regular United Nations budget, emphasizing the need for frequent, predictable and non‑earmarked financing for the Agency.  To that end, Brazil had increased its voluntary financial contributions and regular food assistance to UNRWA, he said, emphasizing that, without progress towards a just and lasting resolution of the question of Palestine, the crisis would continue.

NUR ASHIKIN MOHD TAIB (Malaysia) said the flagrant violations committed by Israel in the West Bank and Gaza had made it challenging for UNRWA to fulfil its duties.  Moreover, the restrictions imposed by Israel were inconsistent with the United Nations Charter and the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and relevant resolutions, she said, calling for the removal of restrictions placed on the movement of UNRWA staff and goods.  Malaysia hoped the Secretary-General would ensure that the Agency enjoyed predictable and sustained funding, he said, adding that, for its own part, his country had just disbursed a contribution of $120,000 to the Agency.

Mr. AL SABAH (Kuwait), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, recognized UNRWA’s support for more than 5.3 million Palestine refugees while noting the primary responsibility of Israel, the occupying Power, for that situation.  Kuwait had always supported the Agency’s activities and had made contributions in excess of $162 million, he noted, recalling that during the 2016 Pledging Conference, his country had pledged $5 million, in addition to making an emergency contribution of $15 million to enable 500,000 Palestinian students to continue their studies.  Moreover, Kuwait had dedicated $50 million to support Palestine refugees in Syria through pledging conferences held inside the country over the years.  The country had also provided $34 million to support Palestinians in Gaza after the occupying Power had destroyed schools in the enclave.  Emphasizing the right of Palestine refugees to return, and their right to regain their dignity, he expressed his delegation’s solidarity with the Palestinian people.

YIĞIT CANAY (Turkey) recalled that 2017 had been an important year in terms of mobilizing diplomatic and political support for UNRWA.  The broad consultation process, mandated by the General Assembly and carried out by Switzerland and Turkey, had animated discussions on ensuring predictable, sufficient and sustainable financing for the Agency.  If implemented by each relevant stakeholder, the recommendations could ensure the continuity of UNRWA’s services and end its recurrent and severe financial shortfalls, which continued to affect its programmes.  However, “the decades-old despair, uncertainty and anxiety in the Palestine refugee community are not easy to overcome,” he cautioned.  As such, Palestinian reconciliation was an important element of a lasting peace, he said, calling upon the international community to respond to that step.

He went on to state that the Palestinian people deserved a strong confirmation of the two‑State vision as well as genuine efforts to end the protracted humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  In terms of stabilizing UNRWA’s financial situation, he acknowledged the establishment of new funding mechanisms with international financial institutions including the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank.  Turkey, for its part, in addition to its increased support for the Agency, had dedicated $100,000 solely towards efforts to materialize those new streams.  While other members of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) had also taken steps in accordance with commitments made in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, in July, support from the broader membership would be vital to realizing concrete results on that track, he said.

IDRISS BOUASSILA (Algeria), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, said UNRWA’s role in helping to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people made it incumbent upon the international community to fulfil its responsibility to provide a solution to the Agency’s critical funding issues, especially in the face of the deteriorating circumstances of the Palestine refugee population.  Denouncing Israel’s restrictions on the movement of UNRWA staff, especially in East Jerusalem, he said they compounded the difficulties for Palestine refugees.  A lasting solution to the situation must be a political one, he said, emphasizing that the international community must help to find a solution to the protracted humanitarian crisis.

MARIO A. ZAMBRANO ORTIZ (Ecuador), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, said that, on the eve of the anniversary of the United Nations mandate for Palestine, it was important to consider the Organization’s role in conflicts like the one in that territory.  In a complex situation, Ecuador recognized the importance of the services provided by UNRWA, he said, appealing to States that were financially able to increase their voluntary contributions to do so.

MOHAMED KHALED KHIARI (Tunisia), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, expressed concern over the recurring funding shortfalls which undermined UNRWA’s efforts to promote human development and meet the basic needs of Palestine refugees.  Tunisia welcomed collective efforts, as well as the Secretary-General’s call to explore all potential means to ensure sufficient, predictable and sustained funding for the Agency, he said, also commending efforts by the OIC, World Bank, Islamic Development Bank and other stakeholders.  He reiterated his delegation’s call for the international community to urge Israel to take the necessary steps to build confidence with the Palestinians through, among other actions, the immediate and complete cessation of all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, in accordance with international law and relevant resolutions.

ANDREY A. LISTOV (Russian Federation) said his country had contributed $10 million to UNRWA’s budget for the period 2016‑2021, which would help to provide predictable financing in accordance with the Secretary-General’s call upon Member States.  The Russian Federation supported increasing the predictability of the Agency’s financing and, as such, had been prepared to consider assistance for UNRWA through the regular United Nations budget.  The Russian Federation was also providing direct humanitarian assistance to Palestine refugees, as well as grants for higher education, he said.  The conflict in Syria had led Palestine refugees to suffer “double deprivation” and it was difficult to imagine the fate of the Yarmouk camp residents without the Agency’s assistance.  In Lebanon, the refugee camps were often controlled by armed groups, a situation exacerbated by the fact that refugees in that country had been joined by refugees from Syria.  Rebuilding vital infrastructure in the Syrian territory liberated from terrorists would be important in that regard, he said.

MAISOON AL-DAH (United Arab Emirates), endorsing the statement by the Non‑Aligned Movement, said she was greatly concerned about the deteriorating conditions of Palestine refugees, as outlined in the Secretary-General’s report.  Israel’s continuing occupation, restriction of movement and demolition of Palestinian properties only increased UNRWA’s burden, she said, adding that its financial crisis would prevent it from providing basic services to 5 million refugees in the region.  In order to solve the financial gap, it would be necessary to implement the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s report, she said, emphasizing that, as one of the Agency’s main donors, her country was committed to continue its efforts to bridge UNWRA’s funding gap, which had grown after the United States had reduced its contribution.

CHENG LIE (China) said the crisis in Syria and other areas continued to spill over, exacerbating the humanitarian situation in Palestine.  Calling on all parties to alleviate pressures on host countries, he urged lifting of the continuing blockade of the Gaza Strip.  UNRWA had made vital contributions to the Palestine refugee population, and had advanced regional peace and stability by preventing the spread of terrorist ideology, he noted.  China had been making contributions to the Agency for more than 30 years, and would continue to support it, he emphasized.  However, only by realizing peace between Israel and Palestine could a lasting solution be found.

INA HAGNININGTYAS KRISNAMURTHI (Indonesia), associating herself with the Non‑Aligned Movement, said that, given the sad and desperate situation of the Palestine refugees, the critical lack of funding for UNRWA was of great concern.  Reiterating her delegation’s position that the United Nations must ensure predictable funding for the Agency, she deplored the failure to approve the proposals on UNRWA funding.  Indonesia supported progress on the establishment of a waqf under the management of the Islamic Development Bank, as well as a trust fund under the World Bank, she said, expressing appreciation for traditional and non-traditional donors as well as regional partners who supported UNRWA.

BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA, Permanent Observer for the Holy See, said his delegation was alarmed about the situation in Syria and the tremendous toll on both Palestine refugees and UNRWA staff.  The Holy See was also gravely concerned about the significant impact of that crisis on neighbouring countries.  Noting that UNRWA’s funding had not kept pace with the increased needs of Palestinian refugees, he declared: “Ultimately our goal is to render UNRWA irrelevant and useless, but the only way to do this is to deprive it of its reason for continued operations through the full implementation of United Nations General Assembly resolution 181 in 1947.”  Expressing grave concern over recent gradual attempts to move away from a two‑State solution, he said inflammatory rhetoric and the straying from the Madrid and Oslo Accords had increased the Palestinian people’s desperation.  Resolving the Palestinian question would have a beneficial cascading effect on other crises in the region, thus allowing UNRWA to enjoy a well-deserved retirement, he said, noting, however, that until that time, its work would remain invaluable to the Palestine refugee population.  The Holy See was convinced that a two‑State solution was the only option that would allow Israel and Palestine to coexist peacefully.

**Closing Remarks**

PIERRE KRÄHENBÜHL, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, thanked delegates for their recognition of the Agency’s role in providing an urgent humanitarian service response, as a contribution to regional stability.  He also expressed gratitude to donor Member States that had reiterated the Agency’s need for continuing support, the host countries for their commitment to the refugees, as well as Turkey and Switzerland for having led the consultations.

Concerning the funding crisis, he said the $77.5 million shortfall represented a very critical situation, and in a week, he would have to make difficult decisions, such as suspending a whole range of UNRWA operations if additional funding was not secured.  As such, he called upon all Member States to come forward, saying it was regrettable that there had been no support for going forward on a fully assessed regular budget option.

Emphasizing the importance of neutrality, he said UNRWA did not sweep such issues under the carpet.  The Agency had been asked about the risk of creating dependency through its activities, he said, emphasizing that every humanitarian organization must look carefully at its operations to ensure that such risks were limited.  The one difference between Palestine refugees and others was that the others could make a choice to return to an independent State, he said.  That was not an option for Palestine refugees in the absence of a political solution, he said.  That fundamental element kept them “in a state of refugeehood”.  There was, therefore, a need to create a political horizon for them.  “Formidable political support must be translated into sustainable funding,” he stressed.

It’s been a year of catastrophic climate events. Rains of biblical proportions across South Asia brought [floods that affected more than 41 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_South_Asian_floods) and killed at least 1,200. Record-breaking hurricanes claimed lives and destroyed infrastructure across several island states in the Caribbean and in towns and major cities in the southern United States. Drought gripping Africa put 20 million people in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen at risk of starvation. And for the third year in a row, countries with coral reefs - from East Asia and the Pacific to northern Africa – [have seen massive sections of their reef systems die](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/analyses_guidance/global_coral_bleaching_2014-17_status.php) due to heat stress from unsustainably high ocean temperatures.

All these events across the globe shout the same warning: [we must accelerate climate action ](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/11/06/a-small-island-country-steps-forward-to-unite-the-world-behind-climate-action#)and deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. At this year’s UN Climate COP in Bonn, Germany, the call to action has found an ideal champion in the [Fiji Government](https://cop23.com.fj/), making history as the first-ever small island state to hold the Presidency and organize the negotiations.

Since the signing of the [Paris Agreement](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/12/12/paris-agreement-paves-way-for-world-bank-group-helping-countries-deliver-on-climate-commitments) in 2015, many positive steps have been made to accelerate climate action on a global scale. [According to the International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2017/march/iea-finds-co2-emissions-flat-for-third-straight-year-even-as-global-economy-grew.html), global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were flat for the third straight year in 2016 even as the global economy grew - evidence of a continuing decoupling of emissions from economic activity. Global markets are undergoing a significant transformation led by renewables, thanks to [rapidly falling costs for solar and wind power](https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook/), with batteries taking on a growing role in balancing supply and demand. And carbon pricing [is gaining global momentum](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/05/23/number-of-carbon-pricing-initiatives-nearly-doubled-over-past-five-years-says-new-report), with over 40 national and 25 subnational jurisdictions now putting a price on carbon pollution.

A Focus on Mobilizing Finance for Climate Action

Meeting the Paris Agreement’s climate commitments will require [investments at an unprecedented speed and scale.](http://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/climate-change-negotiations-action) That is why [mobilizing finance for climate action will be one of the key focus areas for the World Bank Group at COP23.](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/11/06/a-small-island-country-steps-forward-to-unite-the-world-behind-climate-action#) The fact is, there is abundant private financial capital available but much of it is earning low or even negative returns. For many reasons, including weak policy environments and a lack of risk-reducing instruments like guarantees, this capital is not necessarily flowing to where it’s needed most for climate action.

An approach to help unlock this capital is the recently launched [Invest4Climate initiative:](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/brief/mobilizing-finance-for-climate-action-through-the-invest4climate-platform)a new platform convened by the World Bank and the UN, designed to bring together national governments, financial institutions, investors, philanthropists, and multilateral banks to find ways to support transformational climate investments in developing countries.  

Green Bonds are also part of the finance solution by raising funds from the capital markets for climate investments in developing countries. The World Bank Group, through the World Bank and IFC, has played a leading role in developing the green bond market by raising over $15 billion in green bonds since 2008 for investments in climate action around the world, and by helping develop market best practice for standards and reporting. The World Bank and IFC are working with countries to put in place frameworks for sovereign and private sector green bond issuances. Last month, with assistance from the Australian Government and the World Bank Group, [Fiji became the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green bond,](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/10/17/fiji-issues-first-developing-country-green-bond-raising-50-million-for-climate-resilience) raising 100 million Fijian dollars, or US$50 million, to support climate change mitigation and adaption.

A key element of the Paris Agreement was the country-level commitments to action, known as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs. Each NDC commits countries to a range of actions aimed at reducing their emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts. For its part, the World Bank Group is supporting around 300 initiatives across 77 countries related to NDC implementation through investments in areas including energy, agriculture, and transport. And through the [NDC Partnership](http://ndcpartnership.org/) Support Facility launched at COP22 in Morocco in 2016, over $8 million in grants is now flowing to a first set of 23 countries for NDC-related technical assistance, capacity building and project action.

And through the [Climate Action Peer Exchange or CAPE –](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/brief/cape) developing country finance ministries are sharing knowledge with each other on meeting the fiscal challenges of implementing NDCs. A recent CAPE workshop in Shanghai brought together finance ministry staff from 13 countries to discuss approaches to carbon taxes, applying fiscal risk assessment models and establishing climate budgeting systems.

Protecting the Most Vulnerable

Ahead of its COP23 Presidency, Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama [underlined the importance of bringing the perspective of Pacific Islanders ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwWekfPQJLo)and other SIDS and low-lying areas to global attention given their vulnerability to sea level rise and more frequent violent weather. Following the two major hurricanes that hit the Caribbean in September, [ the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility](http://projects.worldbank.org/P108058/caribbean-catastrophe-risk-insurance-facility?lang=en), which was set up under technical leadership of the World Bank, made rapid payouts to 10 Caribbean countries totaling $55 million.

Securing access to financial resources before a disaster strikes is also important. This includes instruments such as emergency funds, insurance mechanisms and contingency lines of credit such as the [Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option](http://blogs.worldbank.org/sustainablecities/cat-ddos-more-emergency-lending-disaster-relief), or Cat DDO. In September, the World Bank board approved a US$150 million Cat DDO to the Dominican Republic to provide immediate financing for emergency relief in case of a natural disaster.

Disaster preparedness and building resilience to the impacts of climate change, especially in the most vulnerable countries, is a key part of the World Bank Group’s [Climate Change Action Plan](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24451). This includes ambitious resilience targets including: putting in place early warning systems and hydro-meteorological data for 100 million people; developing climate-smart agriculture investment plans for at least 40 countries; increasing adaptive social protection for an additional 50 million poor people by 2020; quadrupling funding for resilient transport; and piloting a new urban resilience development approaches in 15 cities.

A good example comes from Africa where a total investment of $600 million under the [Africa Hydromet Program](http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/brief/hydromet-in-africa), will deliver modern hydro-meteorological services and improved early warning and response systems in 15 countries. This multi-partner program is expected to assist 100 million people in an eight-year time frame.

And in coastal West Africa, which is under intense pressure from sea level rise and coastal erosion, the planned [West Africa Coastal Areas (WACA) Resilience Investment Project](http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/west-africa-coastal-areas-management-program), aims to give countries access to expertise and finance to sustainably manage their coastal areas. This responds to countries’ need for solutions and finance to help save the social and economic assets of their coastal areas.

In FY2017, the WBG provided over $12 billion in financing for climate-related projects.  

Some results from our work include:

Clean Energy:

- In India, [the World Bank has provided $1 billion in lending](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/06/30/statement-president-jim-yong-kim-end-his-visit-india-june-29-30-2016) for India’s solar projects, helping to support the national mission to increase solar generation to 100 GW by 2022 and bring climate-friendly electricity to millions in India.

- In Fiji, the [Sustainable Energy Finance Project](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/05/24/fiji-growing-a-renewable-energy-industry-while-expanding-electricity-access), a $5.2 million risk-sharing facility supported by the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility, has mobilized more than $40 million in renewable energy and energy efficiency investments in the Pacific island nation. The facility has allowed local financial institutions to extend loans for the supply and purchase of solar systems, small biofuel units, and other equipment to small businesses and low-income consumers who would otherwise not have access to financing.  In the process, the project has helped spread the use of these technologies in Fiji and demonstrated how government, local institutions and the private sector can combine to support commercial lending to borrowers perceived as less creditworthy and catalyze investments at low cost.  In all, 40,000 households have benefited from the project.  

Cities:

- In Vietnam, [the World Bank has assisted the city of Can Tho](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/20743) to become more climate resilient and promote sustainable urbanization and transport corridors. An investment of US$ 250 million from the Bank and US$ 10 million from the Swiss Development Agency (SECO) is implemented across six development sectors to increase the city’s physical, financial and social resilience to adverse events. One of the activities involves combining a transport link and an embankment, which has multiple benefits including reducing water displacement and flooding in the Mekong Delta.

Transport:

- In Tanzania, with World Bank support, Dar es Salaam [launched the Rapid Transit (DART) system](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/01/25/tanzania-city-residents-embrace-new-rapid-transit-service), the first true Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT) in East Africa. The removal of the informal Dala dala minibuses along the BRT corridor is significantly reducing emissions. In addition, the project includes high quality cycle tracks, footpaths, and pedestrian crossings, and will save the Tanzanian economy billions of shillings lost daily in the jams and provide relief to at least 300,000 commuters.

Water:

- In Morocco, [the Bank Group is supporting the government’s National Irrigation Savings Program,](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/07/08/improved-irrigation-services-for-farmers-in-morocco) with a new $150 million commitment, which builds on $500 million of prior commitments. It will help poor and vulnerable farmers with more efficient irrigation technologies so they can cope with variability in water supply.  
  

- In The Philippines, [the Bank Group is providing a $208 million commitment](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/09/28/philippines-wb-aiib-approve-funding-for-flood-management-in-metro-manila) to improve flood management in selected areas of Metro Manila through constructing new and modernizing existing pumping stations, and improving solid waste management.

Forests:

- In Mozambique, earlier this year, the [World Bank approved a $47-million project aimed in investing in the livelihoods](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/03/07/world-bank-injects-47-million-to-stem-deforestation-in-mozambique) of thousands of small and medium landholders, improving the sustainability of activities that can impact forests, including the production of timber, charcoal and agricultural crops.  
  
- In Ethiopia, the World Bank [recently approved $18 million grant to support a sustainable landscape program that spans Ethiopia’s Oromia region](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/03/23/world-bank-signs-18-million-grant-to-crowd-in-forest-action-in-ethiopia) with a population over 30 million people. This funding will go towards improving sustainable forestry and land use planning at the state and local levels, increased work on forest-smart policies, technical training and a state-wide information campaign on how land is used.

- In China, the [Shandong Ecological Afforestation Project](http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2017/07/26/china-afforestation-project-in-shandong-improves-environment-and-farmers-incomes) planted trees on 66,915 hectares of barren mountainous slopes and saline coastal areas, increasing forest cover, reducing soil erosion, and improving the environment and biodiversity. The project contributed to the sequestration of the equivalent of 12 million metric tons of CO² over the project’s six-year lifetime.

Climate-Smart Agriculture:

- In Uruguay, the [Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Climate Change](http://projects.worldbank.org/P124181/sustainable-management-natural-resources-climate-change?lang=en) (DACC) project is supporting sustainable intensification through a number of initiatives including the establishment of an Agricultural Information and Decision Support System (SNIA) and the preparation of soil management plans. Since 2014, climate-smart agriculture has been adopted on 2,946,000 hectares, providing for a carbon sequestration potential of up to 9 million tons CO2 annually.

- In Niger, [the Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) Support project](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/05/26/climate-smart-agriculture-project-to-improve-productivity-and-resilience-of-nigers-agriculture-sector) aims to benefit 500,000 farmers and agro pastoralists in 44 communes. It will increase distribution and use of improved, drought-tolerant seeds, and increase the number of farmers using irrigation.

Carbon Pricing:

- Convened by the [Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition](https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/) (CPLC) at COP 22 in Marrakesh and supported by the Government of France and the World Bank Group, the [High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices](https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/report-of-the-highlevel-commission-on-carbon-prices/) brought together 13 leading economists to identify the range of carbon prices which would help deliver on the core goal of the Paris Agreement: keeping the rise in global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius. The Commission, led by Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Lord Nicholas Stern concluded that a carbon price of $40-$80 per ton of CO2 equivalent by 2020, rising to $50-$100 per ton by 2030, when combined with supportive policies, would allow for achievement of the Paris goal.

- In Mexico, [the Partnership for Market Readiness (PRM](https://www.thepmr.org/)), which supports countries to assess, prepare, and implement carbon pricing instruments to scale up greenhouse gas mitigation, is helping the country to launch an emissions trading system (ETS) next year.  The PMR is supporting an ETS simulation with over 90 companies (94) are participating voluntarily, representing 67% of Mexico’s total emissions.

- Last October, Chile completed its PMR proposal which included activities that significantly contributed to the implementation of their carbon tax. Among other things, the program included analyzing the impact of the existing carbon tax scheme in the country's energy matrix; assessing how the current carbon tax scheme could evolve, be enhanced and complemented; training of more than 650 representatives from the public and private sectors in carbon pricing instruments and use of systems to monitor, report and verify (MRV).

- This year, the World Bank contributed to advancing carbon pricing intelligence by launching two interactive platforms: The [Carbon Pricing Dashboard](http://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/) an online tool with the latest data on carbon pricing; and the [Mitigation Action Assessment Protocol](https://maap.worldbank.org/#/homepage) (MAAP) online interface, a tool that establishes a transparent and independent framework to help governments, project developers, investors and other relevant stakeholders to design, assess and compare the relative risks and performance of mitigation efforts across the globe.

2303999,"CERF Advisory Group Comes Together in New York and Discusses Future of the Fund On 24 and 25 October 2017, the CERF Advisory Group held its annual meeting in New York to discuss the use and management of the fund and provide guidance on key policy issues.

Chair of the Advisory Group, Leni Stenseth and CERF Chief, Lisa Doughten welcomed the new members to the group: Jamie Isbister, Bruno van der Pluijm, Alexandra MacKenzie, Ricardo Toro Tassara, Rahel Asfaw, Claus Lindroos, Alison Milton, Mairo Mandara and Per Enarsson, and provided an introduction to CERF for new members, noting the essential role of the group in providing advice on the future of CERF.

Doughten then briefed the Advisory Group on the use and management of the fund during the period since its previous meeting in May 2017 and focused particularly on CERF’s response to the Rohingya refugee crises, emergencies related to the El Nino phenomenon, as well as CERF’s responses to Hurricane Irma and Maria in the Caribbean.

In his remarks, Assistant Secretary- General for Strategic Coordination in the Secretary-General’s Office, Fabrizio Hochschild, emphasized the essential role of CERF as a life-saving enabler in humanitarian emergency responses highlighted the importance of the Advisory Group appointed by the Secretary-General, articulating the Secretary-General’s support to CERF, especially the expanded target of $1 billion. _“CERF needs to grow because humanitarian needs are growing. It is one of the most effective tools to make a difference for people in need.”_ Hochschild concluded.

In a session with Resident Coordinator (RC) /Humanitarian Coordinators (HC) from Somalia and Barbados/OECS and members of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, the RC/HCs provided examples of the use and impact of CERF funds and results achieved with CERF funds in Somalia and Barbados. RC/HC from Somalia, Peter de Clercq expressed appreciation for the $92 million received over the past two years and emphasized the positive effects of the complementarity between the use of CERF funds and funding from the Somalia Country-Based Pooled Fund. Stephen O’Malley, HC in Barbados/OECS acknowledged CERF’s added value to coordination and noted that _“receiving funding from CERF allowed for better coordination with UN agencies who were located away from each other.”_

In a session headed by Assistant Secretary-General Ursula Mueller, the Advisory Group expressed appreciation for presentations on initial findings from reviews of the added value of the fund for the response to crises caused by the El Nino phenomena. The final session of the meeting on the future of CERF focused on resource mobilization for CERF towards the General Assembly mandated increase of the fund to $1 billion. Mueller closed the session by calling upon Advisory Group members’ advocacy for CERF targeting state leaders and UN principals.

Advisory Group

Established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2005, the CERF Advisory Group provides the Secretary-General with periodic policy guidance and expert advice on the use and impact of CERF.

Advisory Group members serve in their individual capacity, and not as representatives of their countries or Governments. They include Government officials from contributing and recipient countries, representatives of humanitarian non-governmental organizations and academic experts. Members have been carefully selected to reflect a geographical and gender balance.

2297239,"Infant and young child feeding in emergencies: Joint statement on action Institute of Public Health Nutrition (IPHN), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, UN Agencies (UNICEF, UNHCR, WHO and WFP) and Nutrition Sector Partners call for all involved in the response to the influx of Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh to provide appropriate, prompt support for the feeding and care of infants, young children and their mothers as a critical means of supporting child survival, growth and development and avoiding malnutrition, illness and death.

This can be achieved by protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding, identifying and targeting assistance to non-breastfed infants, enabling appropriate complementary feeding, and strongly discouraging the uncontrolled distribution and use of items that may be used as breast-milk substitutes (BMS), such as infant formula or other milk products.

Following the violence that broke out in Rakhine State of Myanmar on 25 August, over half a million people have crossed the borders into Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh. The influx of over 519,000 people exacerbates the fragile infant feeding practices and undernutrition among children and women living in the existing makeshift settlements and refugee camps. The recent flow of people is expected to continue, putting additional risks on families, including their ability to feed themselves and their children, and increased exposure to health risks. Under the current influx of Rohingyas in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, children from birth up to two years are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition, morbidity and mortality. Immediate action to protect recommended infant feeding practices is necessary, with targeted support to higher risk infants and children.

Stakeholders are reminded to take the needs of infants and young children, their caregivers and pregnant and lactating women into account during needs assessments. This should include consultation with the affected population during assessment, planning and implementation of a context-specific Infant and Young Child Feeding in Emergencies (IFE) response. It is essential to monitor the impact of humanitarian actions and inaction on IYCF practices, child nutrition and health.

The IFE response will be coordinated through the nutrition sector mechanism under the coordination authority of IPHN, Ministry of Health. Responders are urged to actively engage with coordination efforts and report on any violations observed. Interventions should meet the provisions of the Operational Guidance on IFE and be compliant with the International Code on the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (BMS) and WHO Guidance on Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children. Any violations should be reported to the Nutrition sector in Cox’s Bazar.

Globally recommended IYCF practices maximize the health and nutrition benefits and protection of children and are applicable in emergencies, as well as in normal times. Under normal circumstances, infants who are not breastfed are five times more likely to die from pneumonia and 14 times more likely to die from diarrhoea, than infants who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months. The valuable protection from infection and its consequences that breast milk confers is all the more important in environments without safe water supply and sanitation. Therefore, creation of a protective environment and provision of skilled IYCF support to mothers of children under two and breastfeeding women are essential and are priority interventions.

**Nutritionally vulnerable infants under 6 months**

It is important to address the nutritional needs of infants under 6 months who are small for their age or failing to thrive. Most nutritionally vulnerable infants can be managed in an outpatient setting through support for optimal breastfeeding practices, adequate maternal nutrition, maternal mental health services and addressing clinical illness of the infant and the mother, through an integrated package of care. Most nutritionally vulnerable infants can be managed in an outpatient setting, with only a small proportion classified as high risk requiring inpatient support. Stakeholders are called upon to identify and manage nutritionally vulnerable infants under 6 months of age, focusing on outpatient care for most infants and referring those classified as high risk to inpatient services.

**Meeting the needs of breastfed infants**

Optimal breastfeeding for the first 2 years of life is the single most effective intervention to prevent child deaths worldwide. Breastfeeding saves children’s lives, supports their growth and development, prevents malnutrition, ensures food security for infants, protects maternal and child health, reduces financial pressure on families, supports loving relationships and increases educational attainment. Breastfeeding is even more critical in the current situation as it provides a safe and sustained source of nutrition and critical protection against infection. Breastfeeding practices can be negatively impacted in emergencies such as this one as a result of donation of BMS and blanket BMS distributions, stress or trauma to mothers, loss of social support structures, and lack of privacy to continue breastfeeding. We call for unanimous support and encouragement from skilled breastfeeding counsellors, family members, community leaders, health care providers, policymakers and across all humanitarian sectors.

Multi-sectoral actions are necessary to minimise risks and support safe and appropriate feeding practices during emergencies. This requires cross-sectoral responsibility and engagement: Nutrition, Health, WASH, Food Security and Livelihood, Shelter, Child Protection, Logistics and Camp Management actors. Early assessment of needs; monitoring; timely, accurate and harmonised communication; and responsible, informed actions by all parties to the humanitarian effort, including press/media outlets, civil society, volunteer groups, and governments and the army is also needed.

The joint signatories of this statement urge all responders to protect, promote and support breastfeeding, including early initiation of breastfeeding (within 1 hour of birth), exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life (no food or liquid other than breastmilk, not even water) and continued breastfeeding for 2 years and beyond. Actions to take include:

1. Disseminate consistent and accurate information,  
2. Avoid separation of breastfeeding women and children,  
3. Provide the privacy and space required to comfortably breastfeed and prioritise pregnant and lactating women for services and commodities,  
4. Health actors are reminded that breastfeeding is an evidence-based, effective intervention and its promotion and support is a critical component of health programming.

**Meeting the needs of non-breastfed infants**

The joint signatories of this statement recognise that a small proportion of infants are not breastfed and need to be identified, protected and supported.

In line with National IYCF guidelines, and global guidance, appropriate BMS supplies and coordinated, targeted, skilled and consistent support should be provided to those infants who need it, based on agreed upon targeting criteria, and through mechanisms for identification and support, as determined in consultation with Nutrition Sector particularly IPHN, UNICEF, UNHCR and WHO.

BMS, milk products, bottles and teats should never be part of a general or blanket distribution. Stakeholders who are concerned about the needs of non-breastfed infants are encouraged to support responding agencies who are able to meet the provisions outlined in the Operational Guidance on Infant Feeding in Emergencies. It is important to consider prevalent practices, the infectious disease environment, cultural sensitivities and expressed needs and concerns of mothers/caregivers when determining interventions. The use of BMS (such as infant formula) increases vulnerability to illness and malnutrition, creates dependence, is costly and requires considerable resources, including safe water.

**Donations**

Donations of infant formula and other breastmilk substitutes (BMS) are often made during humanitarian crises. This is dangerous and unnecessary. In accordance with internationally accepted guidelines and the Bangladesh BMS Act 2013, all stakeholders are urged NOT to call for, support, accept or distribute donations of BMS (including infant formula), other milk products (such as milk powder), complementary foods, and feeding equipment (including bottles and teats). For donated foods that are not designed as complementary foods but can be used to feed young children, it is important that they are culturally appropriate and meet quality and safety standards.

Stakeholders are requested to report any donations to the Institute of Public Health, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (IPHN, MoHFW) and the Nutrition sector in Cox’s Bazar. Do not send donations of donor human milk to emergencies; consult with IPHN, MoHFW, UNICEF and the nutrition sector for context-specific guidance on donor human milk use in this emergency.

**Meeting the needs of children 6 months – 2 years of age**

The joint signatories of this statement call for prompt, collective action to ensure access to adequate amounts of appropriate, safe, complementary foods and associated support. In this emergency, challenges include provision of appropriate complementary feeding among infants and young children aged 6-23 months. Caregivers are likely to face difficulties in feeding their children due to unavailability of cooking utensils, food unavailability, poor sanitation and lack of safe cooking spaces etc. Consult IPHN or UNICEF and the nutrition sector for guidance on appropriate complementary food provisions and essential interventions, including WASH, FSL and health sector support, and on indications for micronutrient supplementation.

**Maternal wellbeing**

The joint signatories of this statement recognise that women have a right to nutrition and health as well as that a caregiver’s physical and mental wellbeing is an important determinant in her ability to feed and care for her children. Physical and emotional stress can reduce women’s confidence in their ability to breastfeed and diminish the capacity of other family members to support them. Responses should be sensitive to psychosocial needs.

Breastfeeding women need adequate amounts of fluids to support breastmilk production. Undernourished breastfeeding mothers need skilled breastfeeding support and adequate nutrition support to protect their own nutritional status while continuing to breastfeed. Stakeholders are called upon to be sensitive to the increased nutritional needs of pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and to prioritize PLWs for access to food, safe water, shelter, health care, protection and other interventions to meet essential needs. Consult IPHN and UNICEF or WFP and the nutrition sector for guidance on appropriate interventions to ensure nutritional adequacy for pregnant and lactating women.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2295254,"ACT Alliance Fundraising Strategy 2017 - 2018 **I. Background & Purpose:**

*I.1. Background*

The rapidly changing development and humanitarian financing context is challenging ACT Alliance and its members to rethink their business and fundraising strategies. While there are some new opportunities to tap into traditional methods of funding for the work of the Alliance and its members, the implementation of collaborative initiatives has turned out to be more of a challenge.  
In 2014, the Governing Board of ACT Alliance recognised that the sustainability of the global Alliance required that external fundraising be accorded an increasingly prominent role and that this must happen at all levels of the Alliance. By May 2015, the Governing Board concluded that the Alliance Secretariat would need to accumulate close to 20% of its income through external fundraising by 2018. Also in 2015, ACT Alliance formed its first Advisory Group on Fundraising which, among other tasks, was mandated to produce its fundraising strategy and to provide guidance to the Alliance on the principles which should guide itsfundraising. Subsequent to receiving the Governing Board’s endorsement of the direction of a previous fundraising strategy draft, the Advisory Group on Fundraising has developed this current strategy which is closely linked to the Secretariat’s operational plan for fundraising. Taken together, both documents guide concurrent work paths for improving the Alliance’s financial viability, while enabling realization of goals under the Global Strategy of the ACT Alliance.  
Action plans specifying the contributions, levels of ambition and timelines required to meet this strategy’s two objectives will be completed upon full endorsement by the Board.

*I.2. Strategic Aims:*

In order to secure the financial future of ACT Alliance, the Alliance has prioritized three strategic aims. These are meant to inclusively address the common and constituent needs of the global Secretariat, the fora and member organisations. Ensuring that these aims are common to a majority of the members will enable the Alliance to acquire additional and diversified funding within a rapidly changing funding environment.

- Jointly Develop Added Value with a view to mutual benefits - Undertake and Share Donor Intelligence and Forecasting - Maximise opportunities for alignment, harmony and balance among the Strategic Objectives of the AFGs, the Secretariat and membership

*I.3. Values:*

The proposed strategy suggests seven principles on which ACT Alliance would base its fundraising. These include:

- Good donorship supported and implemented;

- Good stewardship promoted and managed; 

- Responsibility-driven resource solicitation;

- Collaboration among the ACT members;

- Advocacy and information as the prologue to fundraising;

- Consistent communication across all interlocutors;

- Key ethical concerns mainstreamed;

- Collaboration rather than competition between the secretariat and members;

- Engagement with national members through Forums.  
Further guidance on good practice will be developed to enable the Alliance’s constituent parts to work well together, based on its values and principles, in fundraising.

*I.4. Scope & Structure:*

This fundraising strategy is focused on the short-term: 2017-18, with a view to laying the ground work required for the longer-term works (and funding) needed in 2018 and beyond. It assumes that throughout the remainder of 2017 and up though 2018, the Secretariat will continue to develop its structure and capacities, and that as it does so, a culture for fundraising must also be built. Moreover, the culture and expectations of the Alliance’s Governing bodies for funding may also be required to evolve. As the operating space and funding for NGOs of all types and sizes continue to shrink globally, there will be fewer and fewer resources available for redistribution among the membership and Secretariat. One of ways in which the expectations for provision of resources will need to be redefined in terms of realities and opportunities involves the impracticality of merely shifting the responsibility for providing Secretariat funding away from the large international organisations and onto any other entity external to the Secretariat. Fundraising will need to be undertaken and managed in the short-term by Secretariatstaff capable of providing true leadership – in addition to technical representation – for leveraging the Alliance’s added value among currently and potentially interested sponsors.  
In the longer-term, i.e., 2018 through 2020, fundraising responsibilities should be spear-headed by a “Resource Acquisitions and Management Unit,” comprised of Secretariat-based, full-time professional fundraisers, and substantially supported by programme and regional Secretariat leadership. Another longer-term goal that should be undertaken during this period is to assess and redesign the configuration of the Alliance’s governing bodies with a view to inclusion of the skill sets and relationships most required to ensure the viability of the Alliance. Ensuring representation of particular groups, regions and interests on the Board will need to be secondary to ensuring that there will first be capacities for engagement represented and that those correspond to the various public, private and individual resources that must be cultivated.  
The role of the AG Fundraising will in neither the short nor long-term scenarios be operational, but will focus on information and advice with regard to the changing donor landscape; including, trends, forecasting, donor intelligence and reliable recommendations for future relationship building.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

2292884,"Which models of donor coordination are most effective for managing multi-donor inputs to deliver technical assistance? Where the delivery of development assistance is fragmented and donor agencies’ activities lack coordination, transaction costs are likely to be exorbitant and the proliferation of parallel service delivery structures undermines both the efficacy and legitimacy of the recipient state’s institutions (German Development Institute 2011). In the area of anti-corruption, inconsistencies in donor approaches entail additional challenges, such as enabling recipient governments to jettison much-needed governance reforms. Although experts have been calling for greater coordination between donors on anti-corruption work for over two decades, progress has been slow and considerable structural constraints remain. These barriers range from the prosaic – development agencies’ differing reporting and funding cycles – to the pathological – instinctive bureaucratic competition. This query surveys various modalities of donor coordination, grouped into three broad categories: funding, information sharing and international engagement. It then considers which forms of donor coordination lend themselves to initiatives designed to tackle sophisticated forms of corruption, such as money laundering and illicit financial flows. A review of the available literature suggests that coordination structures, such as multi-donor trust funds, may facilitate joint approaches in recipient countries, while information-sharing vehicles, such as the OECD’s Anti-Corruption Task Team, could foster high-level dialogue without fixating on the harmonisation of donors’ policies and procedures.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2290069,"Risk-Informed Financing, Development Crucial for Long-Term Disaster Resilience, Saving Lives, Deputy Secretary-General Says at Meeting on Recent Hurricanes DSG/SM/1107-ECOSOC/6874-ENV/DEV/1819

24 October 2017

Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, at the Economic and Social Council special meeting “Aftermath of Recent Hurricanes:  Achieving a Risk-Informed and Resilient 2030 Agenda”, in New York today:

I am honoured to address, on behalf of the Secretary-General, the Economic and Social Council at this special meeting on the aftermath of recent hurricanes.  I thank the President of the Economic and Social Council for convening this important and timely meeting.  I would like to express special appreciation to Ambassador Inga Rhonda King, Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, for her passion and commitment on this important issue.  I join the President in expressing my deepest condolences to the affected people and Governments.

Disasters can erase, in an instant, development gains made over many years, leading to death, displacement, damage, disruption and despair.  The international community has a responsibility to support affected countries to become more resilient; to promote a risk-informed approach to reconstruction; and to strengthen their financial systems so that they can cope with such large‑scale shocks.

As you know, the Secretary-General recently travelled to Antigua and Barbuda and to Dominica to show solidarity and see the damage for himself.  He made a very strong appeal not only for humanitarian aid, but also for new mechanisms for building resilience.

We commend the Governments of the Caribbean region for their leadership in preparedness and response.  The regional emergency response mechanisms, including through the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, along with the pre-deployment of United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination teams across the region and international solidarity, have helped save lives.  Assessments are under way through the post-disaster needs assessment of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, and the Damage and Loss Assessment of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).

However, more must be done at all levels to manage disaster and climate risk and to prepare for future extreme weather events, which are likely to grow in severity and frequency.  Risk-informed sustainable development is an absolute necessity and should inform our policies and investment criteria.

Risk-informed development also requires risk-governance systems that can overcome the policy, institutional and programme siloes in which work on climate change, disaster risk reduction and environment is often pursued.  The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction gives us the tools to address new challenges and opportunities.

The devastating impact of severe climate events on vulnerable communities translates into acute needs and high costs.  As we move into recovery, we need to do things differently:  use energy sources that are not reliant on the import of fossil fuels, construct homes and businesses away from hazardous coastal areas or ravines and ensure that livelihoods can rebound much faster.

We applaud the vision of Caribbean Governments in moving towards green economies and renewable energy.  We also applaud the region’s citizens in responding to the disasters, and we should find every means to support their efforts.  Remittances from citizens outside of the region are today even more important in meeting immediate needs and investing in rebuilding better than before.  International efforts need to be accelerated to reduce the costs of transferring such payments, which would mean more reaches the families and communities that need them most.

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will require public and private investments that can counteract the adverse effects of climate change and the consequences of rapid urban population growth.  Investing in disaster-resilient infrastructure and housing pays off over the long term by reducing economic losses and loss of life.  We must harness the power of technology, innovation and partnerships to move towards a green, clean, sustainable energy future.

We must help now, but also help the region to prepare for a future that is likely to be marked by a higher frequency and intensity of external shocks.

As the Secretary-General has stressed, we must ensure that financing supports the longer-term resilience of affected countries facing the growing threat of external shocks.  We should reconsider eligibility criteria for concessional financing, so that a country’s vulnerability can be taken into account in a more systemic manner.  This has been done in the past to support middle-income countries hosting large refugee populations, notably Jordan and Lebanon.

I would like to highlight the work of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development, convened by the Secretary-General, on the inventory of quick disbursing mechanisms for financing in the aftermath of shocks, that will be published in its 2018 report.

Today, the fundamentals of financing are not aligned to the needs of a world facing the effects of climate change.  We need to innovate in our approaches to structuring finance going forward, encouraging the use of debt instruments that take into account the vulnerability of countries in order to provide a reprieve from debt payments in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. There are precedents to using so-called “state-contingent” debt instruments, for example with built in catastrophe clauses.  More ambitious innovations should also be considered, such as ECLAC’s proposal for debt for climate adaptation swaps linked to investment in resilience in Caribbean countries.

We urge the Council to encourage urgent and concrete actions that the international community can take to support initiatives to assist the affected countries to pursue a risk-informed approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda.  Such actions need to address the three-fold aim of meeting immediate needs, putting into place new concessionary financing arrangements, and designing and implementing a framework for financing resilience for the long term.

The Secretary General looks forward to determined follow-up action by the Council to ensure strong progress on the ground.

The United Nations system will contribute at all three levels — global, regional and local — continuing to assist affected countries and territories in their efforts towards recovery and resilience, and working with our partners to secure financing arrangements that support climate-resilient investments for the long-term.

As the Secretary-General has stated time and time again, the 2030 Agenda is humanity’s best tool for a future of prosperity, peace and dignity for all.   This is an opportunity we cannot waste.  Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals universally will require a different approach to the way Governments and societies approach sustainable development.  And to the way we anticipate and manage our crises. Our partners — in the Caribbean and beyond — can count on the United Nations as a strong advocate, committed partner and catalyser of partnerships and financing to ensure that we all remain on track to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2286534,"Mo’ money, mo’ problems **Guidance is getting better, but is domestic resource mobilisation getting enough attention in the transition debate?**  
Aid steps in where countries can’t afford to provide for the basic needs of their people. As national economies grow, countries are better able to fulfil responsibilities to their people by delivering fundamental rights to health, education and social protection. So what do we do when economies grow but health outcomes don’t improve, governments choose not to spend money on those most in need, and the majority remain poor while the few get richer?  
In a shrinking and uncertain donor landscape, every pound counts. Organisations like the Global Fund to Fight HIV, TB and Malaria, the World Bank’s International Development Association and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, all use criteria like gross national income and disease burden to decide which countries are eligible for funding. For some countries this will mean losing funding from multiple donors as they move from low- to middle-income status.  
But higher income status is not always accompanied by improvements in health. The large number of people living in middle-income countries and persistent inequalities in wealth and access to services mean that the highest burden of many of the world’s biggest killers is no longer in the poorest countries. India and Nigeria, for example – the two countries with the highest burden of pneumonia (WHO, Global Health Observatory Data 2000-2015) – are middle-income countries.  
NGOs and funding institutions are increasingly grappling with these challenges. Last week, a civil society roundtable on transition came together to discuss their work and opportunities for cooperation. Guidance for countries and donors is getting better. Results UK recently released a briefing on the impact of donor transition, Leaving no-one behind, and it’s not alone. Other organisations – including ACTION, the Overseas Development Institute and institutions like the Global Fund – are working to design safe transition strategies.  
Planning the transition from external support to domestic financing of immunisation and disease responses is essential to ending epidemics of the most deadly diseases and sustaining gains made. In Romania, withdrawal of donor support for HIV programming in 2009 was followed by a rise in HIV infection rates among people who use drugs from 3.3% to 27.5% over four years. Marginalised populations, minorities and civil society organisations, which are often excluded from government funding, face real risks if the shift from donor to domestic financing is not managed with equity and sustainability in mind.  
Safe transition requires forward planning to ensure continuity of funding through a shift to domestic resources for health. Yet domestic resource mobilisation seems to have fallen down the transition agenda. Instead, in the context of increased political polarisation, the growing strength of southern economies and a new aid agenda shaped by the Sustainable Development Goals and the demands of humanitarian disasters, the transition debate is turning from transitioning countries to a ‘world in transition’. While many aspects of the political and development landscape are in flux, this shift in focus draws attention away from the state’s obligation to ‘take steps to the maximum of its resources’ to progressively realise the right to health (as set out in Article 2, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). Critically, it risks distracting donors and NGOs from their essential role supporting national governments to develop strategies for domestic health financing.  
Domestic resources are the most reliable and sustainable source of health financing and should be at the core of transition planning research shows that to achieve universal health coverage, health systems must rely predominantly on public revenue.  
The shift to domestic resource mobilisation will not be easy. Donors must assist by helping countries to develop financing strategies. States should ensure that the benefits that economic growth has brought the rich and powerful within their borders are enjoyed by all, through progressive taxation and the introduction of national health insurance schemes. Protection for marginalised groups and supported transition will continue to be important to ensure that gains made are not lost and that rights are not allowed to be neglected. The role of states and domestic financing must be at the centre of transition discussions.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"
2285149,"Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF) Hawiga Reserve Allocation Strategy (2 October 2017) **Overview**

o This Reserve Allocation Strategy is issued by the Humanitarian Coordinator (HC), in consultation with the Clusters and Advisory Board of the IHF, to set the IHF funding priorities for the Hawiga Response Plan.

o A total amount of up to USD 20 million is available for this allocation. This allocation strategy paper outlines the allocation priorities and rationale for the prioritization.

o This allocation paper also provides strategic direction and a timeline for the allocation process.

o The “Reserve Allocation” modality has been chosen for this allocation for the following reasons;

➢ The military operation is about to commence, therefore there is an urgent need to disburse funds as soon as possible.

➢ The Reserve Allocation Modality will reduce the time taken for administrative and technical review processes

➢ A standard allocation process would take longer and clash with the timeframe for the HNO/HRP development process creating additional workload on partners and clusters

Allocation strategy and rationale Situation overview Hawiga district in Kirkuk Governorate has been under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) since June 2014. On 21 September, the military operation to retake Hawiga and East Shirqat from ISIL started and is likely to cause a sudden displacement of the population from Hawiga district towards the south-west of Kirkuk Governorate and Salah al Din.  
To support preparedness efforts and to ensure a well-coordinated, timely and effective humanitarian response, OCHA, with support from Clusters, has developed the Hawiga Response Plan. This plan, now endorsed by the HCT, identifies each Cluster’s critical response priorities and funding requirements to respond to the displacement. Following HCT approval the Humanitarian Coordinator has authorised an IHF Reserve Allocation of up to $20 million to be made available to partners in support of the Hawiga Response Plan which forms the basis of this Allocation Strategy.  

**Humanitarian Response Plan (Hawiga Response Plan)**

This allocation strategy is based on priorities as outlined in the Hawiga Response Plan as developed and agreed by the ICCG. The nature of the military offensive will determine the number of people displaced, vulnerable groups and their specific needs. First line emergency assistance covering water and sanitation, ready-to-eat food and emergency medical care at checkpoints and reception centres will need to scale up.  

Some families will settle with relatives and host communities already in stretched conditions. Access of those families to assistance will need to be strengthened. Based on the Iraqi Central Statistics Office population figures pre-ISIL period, and considering the displacements since June 2014, it is estimated that about 85,000 people currently remains in east Shirqat and Hawiga districts and could be potentially affected by the military operation to retake the areas from ISIL.  

A major challenge remains providing humanitarian assistance once areas become accessible, including to Hawiga town itself. The military strategy and the military forces that will run the operation will influence the number of people displaced, the displacement routes and accessibility. Based on the available information at this stage, the humanitarian community, in consultation with the local authorities and partners in the field, identified possible scenarios in the Hawiga Response Plan for when the military operation starts. In turn these scenarios will influence the design and implementation of Humanitarian projects submitted for funding under this allocation.",4597,"Humanitarian Financing"

2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"
2393064,"WHO EMRO | Emergencies in the Eastern Mediterranean Region in 2017: the year in review As host to some of the world’s biggest emergencies, the Eastern Mediterranean Region carries the largest burden of people in need of aid, with more than 76 million people directly or indirectly affected by political conflict, environmental threats, and natural disasters.

In 2017, Syria entered into its 7th year of conflict and Yemen’s health system is failing due to two years of intensified conflict, the economic crisis and a huge cholera outbreak. In Iraq, a military offensive aiming at liberating Mosul led to the displacement of almost 1 million people. Somalia is facing a triple threat of drought, impending famine, and disease outbreaks. Libya, OPT and Afghanistan struggle to provide health care services in insecure and under-resourced settings. Health security threats present in the region, such as acute watery diarroeah/ cholera, place populations at increasing risk.

Following are key highlights of WHO’s work in emergencies in 2017.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"
2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

• Ethiopia continues to receive undocumented Ethiopian migrants repatriated from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 

**OCHA Director of Operations visited Ethiopia**

On 12-14 December 2017, Mr. John Ging, OCHA Director of Operations, visited Ethiopia to first-hand review the status of the Government-led international humanitarian response to drought and conflict-affected communities, including internally displaced people. The director met and discussed with the federal and regional Government of Ethiopia, donors, humanitarian agencies and communities affected by drought and conflict. Mr.Ging acknowledged the strong partnership the Government of Ethiopia has established over the years with the Humanitarian Country Team. He said that his visit is “a reflection of the importance of that partnership.”

The director visited Hamaressa IDP camp with over 4,000 people internally displaced by the Oromo-Somali inter-communal disputes. Following a briefing by the East Hararge zone administration about the scale of the crisis, Mr.Ging reassured authorities that he is committed to advocating for appropriate response to the crisis. The zonal authorities requested for urgent food and non-food assistance to IDPs East Hararge zone.  

Meanwhile subsequent intercommunal clashes were reported in West Hararge zone of Oromia region on the 12, 15 and 16 December resulting in more than 60 deaths. OCHA will continue to work with Government to verify access conditions and impact on humanitarian operations. Conflict has left close to 857,000 people displaced throughout the country.  

**Visit to Somali region**

During the meeting with the Somali Regional Government authorities, the region requested Mr.Ging’s advocacy support to scale up the ongoing response, particularly amidst the growing IDP needs and called for development investment in durable solutions for predictable pastoralist needs. The region also asked for the speedy implementation of cashbased assistance in all targeted woredas/districts.

2392884,"Iraq - Conflict ETC User Feedback Survey report (Survey period 26/11/17 to 10/12/17) The humanitarian crisis in Iraq remains one of the largest and most volatile in the world. The pace of displacement over the past three years is nearly without precedent. In 2014, over 2.5 million civilians were displaced in Iraq; in 2015, more than an additional 1 million were forced to flee. During the past year, nearly 700,000 people in areas impacted by the conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have been newly displaced.

The surge in violence between armed groups and government forces has resulted to over 3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) across Iraq and left more than 11 million in need of humanitarian assistance. Since August 2014, the ETC has been providing vital shared communications services to the entire humanitarian community to support their activities on the ground.

The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) Iraq conducted a User Feedback Survey in December 2017 to assess the quality of the services delivered by the ETC in common operational areas across the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and in Ninewa governorate. The survey was also used to encourage humanitarians to provide feedback to identify areas of improvement in line with evolving needs on the ground.

2392724,"IOM Regional Response to the Syria Crisis (November 2017) Suad was happily living in her village in Homs, Syria with her husband and six children, working as a tailor. All that changed when the war happened and fighting started in her village. Suad and her family decided to leave all their belongings behind and flee; walking over 1,000km until they reached Idleb. They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent. Suad decided to borrow money from her neighbours and buy an old, second-hand sewing machine to bring in a little income.  

Learning about IOM’s Project from her husband, Suad applied and was soon accept- ed. “You can’t believe how happy I feel. I’ll be able to pay back the money I borrowed for the old sewing machine because it was quite a burden to us.” With the money she saved, she is able to support her family and buy medication for her sick husband. “I am getting closer to achieving my goal. I’ll work hard so I can take my kids from this tent to a decent apartment.

2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

The Emergency Appeal is currently being revised and these changes will be reflected. The revised Emergency Appeal will be focused in carrying out roof repairs in coordination with the local authorities.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

The IFRC continues providing support and coordination with the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) through its Country Cluster Support Team based in Dominican Republic, and through the Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) based in Panama. The Country Cluster Support Team and the regional disaster management coordinator (also emergency shelter focal point) are giving the support to all the response actions of this operation. The sectors and needs addressed by this Emergency Appeal were identified by the CRC in coordination with the government.

The Spanish Red Cross, who has had presence in the country, deployed one staff member to support the National Society’s response efforts. In addition, on the onset of the emergency and on 9 October, two staff members from the Canadian Red Cross Society were deployed to Cuba with the aim to contribute to the response requirements of the Cuban Red Cross.

The Cuban Red Cross coordinated bilaterally with the Spanish Red Cross, through its permanent cooperation program, a shipment of new clothes and footwear for adults, and psycho-pedagogical centres including children without subsidiary protection.

**Movement Coordination**

The Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) has been sharing official information from the CRC with all Movement members. The CRC led coordination meetings at country level with the Spanish Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Society.

At the onset of Hurricane Irma, communication was established with Movement partners to inform of the storm’s path through the Caribbean. Similarly, the necessary information mechanisms were established through the Partnerships and Resource Development (PRD) department.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"
2391604,"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock – Statement on Yemen, 24 December 2017 I remain deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Yemen, where more than 22 million people need humanitarian assistance – 8.4 million of whom are already on the edge of starvation. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have continued and must stop. I am encouraged, however, by the news that the first commercial fuel imports into Hudaydah port since 6 November docked today, while commercial food imports that resumed in recent weeks have continued. 

Yemen imports approximately 90 per cent of its food and nearly all its fuel and medicine. The steady flow of these imports is a lifeline for millions of civilians. Commercial food imports are needed to keep food available and affordable in markets across the country. Fuel imports are essential to run generators in hospitals and health facilities, as well as to power water networks and sanitation systems, among other essential activities. Millions of people depend on these critical services. Hudaydah port is the closest port to the majority of Yemenis. 

As Yemen continues to grapple with widespread hunger, malnutrition, internal displacement, the world’s largest cholera outbreak, an alarming diphtheria outbreak and other challenges, it is essential that we work together to keep commercial food, medicine and fuel imports flowing into all ports. We must also ensure that life-saving humanitarian assistance is able to enter all ports swiftly and quickly reaches the millions of people who need it. Humanitarian aid is often shipped on commercial vessels, further underscoring the importance of keeping all ports open to humanitarian and commercial vessels. I am committed to working with all stakeholders to achieve this as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to seeing commercial imports of critical supplies stabilize at adequate levels. 

Commercial imports alone will not be enough to address the vast humanitarian crisis in Yemen or to provide a sustainable solution. I therefore reiterate my call for all parties to the conflict to provide unconditional, sustained humanitarian access – for both staff and supplies – across the country and without interference. I also call on all parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and engage meaningfully with the United Nations to achieve an inclusive, negotiated political settlement.

- While the anti-terrorist operation against ISIL in Deir-ez-zor continues, sector partners remain active in providing emergency relief assistance. In November, UNHCR with SARC collectively assisted around 52,000 people with core and supplementary non-food items. Among the locations served include Al Mayadin, Deir-ez-zor City, Enbeh, Lower Baqras, and Shmeitiyeh.

- For the first time in four years, humanitarian aid trucks were able to access both government and armed opposition group (AoG) held areas along Aleppo to Hama (M5) highway. It can be recalled that since 2013 this route was completely blocked restricting public transport and humanitarian aid delivery. With this new development, it is expected that humanitarian actors will utilized this highway to transport relief assistance particularly in the western countryside. As of this report, humanitarian aid trucks were reported to arrive in AoG-controlled areas in rural Aleppo and parts of Idleb as well as governmental areas in west Aleppo.

**Description of the disaster** 

As Tropical Storm Tembin (local name: Vinta), aims to exits Philippine landmass, the trail of destruction it has left is emerging. Latest information indicates that Tembin has caused dozens – potentially hundreds – of fatalities, damaged thousands of houses, washed away vast amounts of livelihoods and disrupted the lives of people mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao Island in the Philippines.  

According to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Tropical Storm Tembin made landfall in Cateel,  Davao Oriental, on Friday 22 December 2017 afternoon packing maximum winds of 90 kilometres per hour (km/h) and gusts of up to 125 km/h. The tropical storm then continued across Mindanao, tracking over the provinces of Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental and Zamboanga del Norte. It weakened before re-intensifying late Saturday, 23 December, and is now threatening southern parts of Palawan. In a bulletin issued at 17:00h local time on Saturday, PAGASA indicated that Tembi was packing maximum winds of 90 km/h and gustiness of up to 115 km/h.  

According to a report issued by the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s – Fifth DROMIC Report on TS Tembin – as of 23 December 2017 morning the following had been recorded:

• 18,177 families or 72,592 persons are affected in 312 barangays in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, and CARAGA   

• A total of 12,768 families or 50,362 persons are currently staying inside 211 evacuation centres in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, CARAGA  

There are reports of widespread flooding as the major rivers breached their banks. There have also been several reports of flash floods and landslides. Initial reports indicate that at least 106 people have lost their lives, i.e. 47 in Zamboanga del Norte, 36 in Lanao del Norte, 18 in Lanao del Sur, and 5 in Bukidnon. Dozen are missing, with the number of fatalities likely to increase. Confirmed numbers are expected in the coming days as the public authorities verify information being received from the affected provinces.  

Government agencies and local responders – including from the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) – are currently undertaking search and rescue operations. Photos shared by rescuers on social media show rampaging, mud-brown floodwaters sweeping down a highway in Lanao del Sur province, engulfing houses and a van, and people seeking refuge on the upper floors of their homes. There are reports of widespread flooding in Cagayan de Oro, one of Mindanao's largest cities, as well as in Zamboanga City. In Davao City, hundreds of families were evacuated their homes on Friday 22 December night as a major Bankerohan river overflowed, flooding several barangays affecting some 31,000 families.  

The situation continues to evolve and more information should emerge in the coming days. What remains clear is that there is a need for a substantial humanitarian response to help meet the immediate needs of affected communities. Already, some of the affected provinces have been placed under a state of calamity, mainly to allow local government units to utilize budget allocations for immediate response.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)). In 2017, these conditions have led several countries to be on the brink of famine.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

2390229,"WFP Nigeria Situation Report #23, 1-30 November 2017 **Highlights**

- In November WFP, both directly and through partnerships, provided food assistance to 1,160,000 people (97 percent of the plan of the month) through in-kind distributions (75 percent) and cash-based transfers (25 percent) in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.

- The onset of the dry season triggered an increase in attacks and renewed military operations in November, particularly in Borno State and parts of Adamawa State. This has caused additional population displacement, substantial casualties, and restricted humanitarian access.

**Situation Update**

- An increase in the number of security incidents is being reported. Non-State Armed Group (NSAG) carried out suicide attacks in Mubi and Madagali towns (Adamawa State), and Magumeri town (Borno State). The Secretary-General strongly condemned the suicide attacks in Mubi, the deadliest this year, and expressed particular concerns as several humanitarian organisations have established their presence in this town to better access vulnerable people in Adamawa.

- Harvests concluded at the end of November across the country. FEWSNET reports that countrywide the cereal production is 9 percent higher than last year and the impact of the harvests combined with other improving macroeconomic indicators has produced a decline in food prices countrywide.

- Although the aggregate production of cereals has been above average across the country, the December FEWSNET and WFP joint market monitoring bulletin reported that the prices of food commodities monitored across the markets in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States have increased compared to last year, as the conflict has affected the local harvest.

- The joint market monitoring bulletin also reported that recent recovery in oil export revenues, coupled with relatively stable inflation, is helping to gradually drive Nigeria’s economy out of recession.

- The food security situation in Northeast Nigeria remains extremely fragile and although the risk of famine has so far been averted, in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe 2.56 million people are currently in need of food assistance.

- Without maintained and even expanded humanitarian food and livelihood assistance, 3.7 million people will be estimated to be at risk of critical food insecurity in the next lean season, June to August 2008.

- Across the three states an estimated 560,000 children 6 to 59 months are acutely malnourished - 310,000 children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and 251,000 with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Further, an estimated 230,000 pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished.

- The IOM-DTM reports from January to October 2017 (Rounds XIV to XIX) indicate that food assistance remains a priority need for displaced households particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.

- During the month sectors and humanitarian partners, including WFP, have been carrying in-depth joint needs assessments in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States whose findings are to feed into the Humanitarian Needs Overview and the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, both to be finalised by mid-December.

- Across the border, tensions increased in Cameroon between the government and Anglophone minority and the dry season has allowed thousands of Englishspeaking Cameroonians to begin fleeing across the border into Nigeria Cross River State via four entry points with Cameroon. UNHCR is currently providing food and non-food items (NFIs) to the 5,277 already registered asylum seekers.

2390024,"North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, November 2017 **Operational Overview**

The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains severe due to ongoing conflict, continued internal displacement and the unpredictable return of refugees from neighbouring countries. New population movements continued to be recorded in November, with 1,862 new arrivals in Gwoza, followed by 729 in Askira/Uba, 428 in Mafa, 373 in Ngala and 358 in Madagali; Jere and Chibok recorded relatively high numbers of departures. Additionally, recent important and unexpected arrivals of population (over 13,000 persons) were recorded in Nganzai, Konduga and Magumeri where there is very limited partner presence due to insecurity and lack of access. Humanitarian agencies mobilised to address to the most urgent needs, in particular through the rapid response mechanism (RRM), filling the most pressing gaps until sectors can plan and deliver a comprehensive response.  

While food security has improved throughout the north-east in 2017 as a result of a massive scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihoods assistance, the situation remains extremely fragile with many households, particularly in Borno State, mainly dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic food and livelihood needs. Many remain forced to resort to negative coping strategies to access food. The most recent Cadre Harmonisé analysis (finalised in November) projects that, without adequate and timely humanitarian assistance, 3.7 million individuals will be facing critical levels of food insecurity during the 2018 lean season (June through September). The figure does not include four Borno State local government areas (LGAs) where data could not be collected due to access constraints (in Abadam, Guzamala and Marte) or lack of partner capacity (in Kala/Balge).  

In addition to food insecurity, issues of protection continue to cause extremely serious concern throughout the north-east, including person-borne explosive device attacks in or near IDP camps, and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of internally displaced persons (IDPs) by those supposed to protect them, as was reported in Bama (Borno State). In addition, on 1 November, four pupils in a primary school in Kwaya Kusar, Borno State, were gruesomely attacked. Two of them died and the other two were severely wounded. This direct attack against an educational institution, the first one in two years, may impact school attendance as parents may fear for their children’s lives. In addition, following the resurgence of attacks by non-state armed groups in some parts of Adamawa State, 12 primary schools have been closed, affecting education continuity for the children enrolled in those schools.  

The dry season has also allowed the work on ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs to accelerate and, to date, five out of the nine planned hubs are complete (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza). Another four (Monguno, Damasak, Banki and Rann) are expected to be fully operational by early 2018. As these hubs offer secure accommodation and Internet connectivity for aid workers, they are instrumental in supporting effective last-mile aid delivery and enhancing local coordination.  

With close to 70 per cent (US$731 million out of $1.05 billion) of the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) funding requirements received before year-end, the humanitarian response in Nigeria is one of the world’s best funded. Thanks to the generous support of donors, many sectors have been able to meet their targets on key life-saving activities. However, a critical gap remained throughout the year in the funding of the Response and Recovery Planning sector. This has hampered the humanitarian agencies’ ability to deliver comprehensive livelihood support to affected people, has slowed down debris removal activities in major towns, and overall limited early recovery work across north-east Nigeria.  

As the year draws to a close, sectors and humanitarian organisations continued to carry out various programme-based and areabased needs assessments which are contributing to drafting the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan, to be finalised respectively by mid-December and early January.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

Brave humanitarian workers based in Kemble, Gloucestershire, are the unsung heroes of 2017 for the role they played in Britain’s rapid responses to three major humanitarian catastrophes this year, the Minister for International Development Alistair Burt has said.

At Britain’s aid distribution hub at Cotswold Airport in Kemble, the Minister thanked staff for their tireless work delivering life-saving UK aid in response to the devastating Caribbean hurricanes, the ongoing Rohingya crisis and to prevent a famine in Somalia this year.

The facility in Kemble is one of two major global stockpiles where the Department for International Development stores life-saving equipment and supplies for crises – and is the only one based in Britain.

This year, emergency UK aid from emergency stockpiles, such as in Kemble, has provided:

- 827 tonnes of supplies in response to hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean, including 6,000 hygiene kits, 5,050 solar lanterns, 4,710 shelter kits, 5,140 water purification cubes and 16,000 buckets;

- 10,000 shelter kits, 20,000 blankets and 10,500 sleeping mats in response to the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh; and - 20,000 shelter kits and peg and pole sets to prevent the humanitarian situation in Somalia deteriorating further.

Speaking at the disaster aid hub in Kemble, International Development Minister Alistair Burt said:

""UK aid has saved countless lives this year by responding rapidly to disasters around the world and our aid distribution hub in Kemble is crucial to getting emergency support to those that so urgently need it.

""These brave humanitarian workers are the unsung heroes of 2017.

""They have played a vital role getting life-saving food, water and shelter to people struck by hurricanes in the Caribbean, innocent families driven from their homes in Burma and people starving because of the food crisis in East Africa.

""The UK prides itself on not only delivering aid quickly, but also making sure our products are the best possible quality.

""I am proud that we are driving innovation and the hub in Kemble is filled to the rafters with durable products that people in emergency situations can rely on in the toughest situations imaginable.

By maintaining its own supplies at Cotswold Airport, the Department for International Development (DFID) is able to fly emergency aid to people in disaster situations as quickly as possible.

The UK’s emergency response capacity has been increased this year and DFID is able to respond to six humanitarian emergencies a year, delivering life-saving supplies to 25,000 people in a disaster.

Staff are on alert 24 hours a day and are ready to respond to disasters that could strike at anytime, anywhere in the world.

Staff are busy restocking the aid distribution hub, which remains ready to respond to any emergencies and is expected to be fully stocked by Christmas Day.

**Notes to Editors**

1. DFID’s aid distribution hub in Kemble has been in operation for more than 8 years.

2. It currently stores solar lanterns, kitchen sets, shelter kits, water purification kits, armoured vehicles, a field hospital, a boat module, an office and life support module and part of an airfield module.

3. The site has 22,000 square foot of storage, which means DFID can respond to six crises a year. The supplies held in Kemble alone could deliver life-saving supplies to 25,000 people in a disaster situation.

4. The facility in Kemble is one of two major global stockpiles where the Department for International Development stores life-saving equipment and supplies for crises – the other stockpile is in Dubai.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

*Description of the disaster*

There have been two significant weather systems to enter the Philippines Area of Responsibility (PAR) since 12 December 2017. 

Tropical Storm Kai-tak: On 12 December 2017, a low-pressure area (LPA) within the PAR developed into a Tropical Depression which was named Kai-tak (locally Urduja). The tropical depression moved north northwest, and by 14 December was reclassified as a Tropical Storm. Kai-tak remained almost stationary off the coast of the Eastern Visayas region and continued to bring moderate to heavy rain across the Bicol and Eastern Visayas regions as it slowly moved towards land. Kai-tak kept its slow pace and eventually made landfall on the afternoon of 16 December 2017 over San Policarpio, Eastern Samar. 

Kai-tak brought heavy rain which triggered flashfloods, floods and a reported 17 landslides in the Eastern Visayas region. In some areas in the province of Samar, as much as two months’ worth of rain poured over a 24-hour span. Tacloban City in Leyte was put under state of calamity on 15 December 2017 due to floods. The municipality of Naval in Biliran province was also put under a state of calamity due to landslides. National disaster management authorities said 41 people were killed and 45 others remain missing. 

As Kai-tak approached, the Philippine government ordered the pre-emptive evacuation of families in the likely affected areas in Eastern Visayas. As of 20 December 2017, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), more than 280,000 families were affected in Region IV-B (MIMAROPA), Region-V (Bicol Region), Region VI (Western Visayas), Region VII (Central Visayas), Region VIII (Eastern Visayas) and CARAGA. Of the affected, more than 267,000 families were from Region VIII and more than 7,500 from Region V. Moreover, some 11,000 families, mostly from Northern and Western Samar province are still housed in 205 evacuation centres. 

Tropical Storm Tembin (Vinta): According to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), an LPA off Mindanao intensified into a Tropical Storm before dawn on Thursday, 21 December 2017, as it continued heading for land. In a bulletin issued at 05:00, 21 December 2017, PAGASA said Tembin had maximum winds of 65 kilometres per hour (kph) and gustiness of up to 80 kph. The tropical storm was 510 kilometres east of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur as of reporting, moving west at a slightly slower 18 kph from the previous 20 kph. PAGASA warned that scattered to widespread moderate to heavy rain is expected over Eastern Visayas,  
CARAGA and Davao Regions within 24 hours. Residents of these areas have been advised to undertake precautionary measures, coordinate with their respective local disaster risk reduction and management offices, and continue monitoring for updates.  

Based on its latest forecast track, Tembin will make landfall over CARAGA - Davao Region area between Thursday (December 21) evening and Friday (December 22) morning. After landfall, Tembin is expected to cross CARAGA, Northern Mindanao, the Zamboanga Peninsula, and Southern Palawan. It will then leave PAR on 24 December 2017.  

Residents of Eastern Mindanao and Eastern Visayas have been put on alert for possible flash floods and landslides. These areas are particularly susceptible to the impacts of heavy rains with flash floods, landslides and flooding.

Through this Operations Update, Ethiopia Red Cross Society (ERCS) seeks to extend the operational timeframe by an additional two months (New end date: 23 February 2018) to enable completion of procurement of Emergency Shelter/NFI kits. ERCS also seeks approval to reallocate 27,773.41Swiss francs planned for the “Inception workshop”, “monitoring and distribution” and “transportation” budget lines to offset the projected over expenditure under ES/NFI procurement caused by increase in prices on the local market. 

It should be highlighted that the assistance to beneficiaries has been provided using NS pre-positioned stocks and the pending procurements will enable the ERCS to replenish the distributed items. The first activity which is not done as per the plan is the inception workshop which was planned to be conducted in Oromia and Afar regions. The planned inception workshop was not conducted since ERCS directly conducted the distribution considering the urgency of the need for ES/NFIs for the displaced people. 

**A. Situation analysis**

*Description of the disaster* 

In Ethiopia, rainfall attributed to the Kiremt rains, which began on 8 September 2017 has led to extensive flooding. The Ambeira zone in Afar region, and special zones surrounding Addis Ababa (the capital), Jima, South-east Shewa, and South-west Shewa in the Oromia region have been worst affected by the rains and flooding. It is estimated that a total of 18,628 households (HHs) (93,140 people) have been affected, of which 7,270 HHs (36,350 people) have been displaced.

In the background of the recent floods, the situation has been complicated further by an escalation in the civil unrest along the Oromo and Somali border, which stretches more than 1,000km. Ethnic clashes have led to the displacement of more than 45,000 HHs (225,000 people) from Oromia and Somali regions, including into the neighbouring Hareri region. The floods and conflict has affected in the same areas in Oromia and Somali regions therefore creating a complex situation",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"
2388834,"Sri Lanka / Dengue Emergency Plan of Action operation update n° 3 (MDRLK007) **A. Situation analysis**

*Description of the disaster*

Sri Lanka has been facing an unprecedented outbreak of Dengue fever. Sri Lanka is a tropical country with two monsoon seasons. With each monsoon brings in two peaks of Dengue fever making it an endemic disease in Sri Lanka. However, 2017 started with an exceptionally high number of Dengue cases which shot up to an outbreak in May-June 2017, creating the largest Dengue outbreak experienced by the country for last three decades.

During the last 11 months of 2017, a total of 174,889 suspected Dengue cases have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Sri Lanka with over 320 deaths.  
Approximately 41.93 per cent of Dengue cases were reported from the Western province. The highest numbers of Dengue cases were reported during the 29th week of 2017. All four Virus types of Dengue have been seen in Sri Lanka. The current outbreak is predominantly due to Dengue Fever Virus Type 2 (DEN-2), which is not the usual type circulating in Sri Lanka. According to the WHO, this is a 4.3-fold higher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016. 

Monthly reported Dengue cases are varied depending on the rains received. In July 2017 the highest number of Dengue cases was reported where 23 per cent of the total Dengue cases reported.  
Presently it can be seen that there is a reduction in Dengue cases reported; 5 per cent in the month of November 2017.

It is expected that the country will face another outbreak after the monsoon rains in months of January and February 2018. However, Dengue cases are emerging in districts where the present outbreak was not previously reported. Historical data shows that there are always two peaks of Dengue incidence in Sri Lanka. One during Southwest monsoons and another during Northeast monsoons. Analysis of the data on the present outbreak shows the incidence of Dengue is getting higher in eastern province and districts adjoining to western province. Especially with the commencement of the North-Eastern monsoons, there is a risk of Dengue outbreaks in more districts. The MoH had requested from SLRCS with a second letter dated 11 September 2017 to scale up the activities at community level.

Since the schools have been considered as a hot spot for Dengue in Sri Lanka and are closed in the month of December. Considering there is trend of outbreak in January and February, SLRCS requested for one month extension till 28 February 2018, to allow sufficient time to complete the school awareness activities and to conduct public awareness public education (PAPE) on Dengue prevention via mainstream media.

SMILE Again Africa Development Organization (SAADO) has developed a searchable message database that can be used to disseminate critical information to affected populations during emergencies in South Sudan.

This follows demand for effective two-way communication between vulnerable communities and humanitarian responders. The information is intended to promote effective humanitarian aid delivery and accountability to the vulnerable communities.

In its current state, the searchable pilot concentrates on only three hazards around South Sudan and has critical information that can be disseminated to respective affected populations as awareness, alert or self-care messages. The three hazards are drought and famine; malaria and measles; landmines and explosives and GBV in addition to some harmful traditional practices.

The process of coming up with the messages included selection of the messages with input from all relevant stakeholders, especially the clusters; translation of the messages into various local languages, namely; Juba Arabic, Dinka and Nuer, respective of area of dissemination; trial dissemination of the messages through various channels to identify the most effective channels; and data collection exercise in which surveys were conducted in areas where the messages are disseminated in Juba and the Protection of Civilians site.

Communities were strongly involved in drafting the messages and suggesting suitable channels of dissemination. Through focus discussions and one on one interview, communities helped in translating the messages and also advising on the channels they trust and which would reach them more.

“The pilot message library is meant to harmonise information dissemination by humanitarian actors in South Sudan, we want to make sure that information is readily available in times of emergencies,” said SAADO Communications Manager Walter Mawere. Stakeholders have welcomed the online platform and called for its scaling up highlighting that it is very helpful in emergency response.

The South Sudan government through the ministries of Education, Health and the South Sudan Mines Authority was extensively involved in the process to come up with a searchable message database. This was to ensure that the messages are safe for dissemination, objective, culturally sensitive and within the context of South Sudan before it is made available for mass consumption.

The Message Library is hosted on the CDAC Network website which you can visit [here.](http://www.cdacnetwork.org/tools-and-resources/message-library/south-sudan/)

2387879,"Details Announced on Expanded Approach to Sustainably Address Humanitarian Situation in
Yemen December 20, 2017: Today, the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen- represented by the Spokesperson, Col. Turki Al Maliki, along with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Yemen- Ambassador MonahmmedAl Jaber, spoke at a joint press conference in Riyadh to discuss details around a more comprehensive approach to relieve the suffering of the Yemeni people and address the humanitarian situation there with a long-term view. The full humanitarian response plan will be announced soon.  
Humanitarian Plan Overview by the Kingdom’s Ambassador to Yemen, Ambassador Mohammed Al Jaber

- The comprehensive humanitarian efforts aim to remedy the human condition in Yemen, through providing humanitarian aid and commercial shipments of foodstuffs, petroleum products, and other commercial goods delivered to the Yemeni people in all regions of Yemen. It aims at doing so in a way that addresses the needs of Yemen, providing a means for a dignified life for the Yemeni people, at a level much higher than it was at during the year 2017. The goal of the humanitarian operations is not to provide a temporary solution but to address and repair the humanitarian conditions in Yemen in a comprehensive and lasting manner.

- The Coalition today has declared that it will continue to keep Hodeidah Port open for humanitarian and aid provisions, allowing entry for commercial shipments, including petroleum byproducts, foodstuff, and other products, for thirty days, as a measure to support the effort of the UN envoy Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh and his recommendations regarding Hodeidah Port.

- The Coalition will permit the entry of the UN’s four cranes to Hodeidah Port.

- The humanitarian operations include increasing the capacity of the Yemeni ports, using the various land passes from the Kingdom, and using the Port of Jizan, if the need arises, to ensure that humanitarian aid and commercial shipments are delivered to all the regions in Yemen.

- The Coalition will provide safe passage corridors for the humanitarian aid and commercial shipments to reach their destinations in all the regions of Yemen. This step aims to ensure that the humanitarian aid operations are flexible. The goal of delivering comprehensive humanitarian aid and commercial shipments remains, despite the Iranian-backed Houthi militias continued impedance and rejection of all the global efforts and suggestions in this regard.

- We will coordinate with the legitimate government of Yemen, through convening urgently in the coming days with the UN and other humanitarian organizations, to discuss the various details of the humanitarian operations, and the means and mechanisms of implementation, as well as, the role of the UN and humanitarian aid agencies play, to complete the organizational discussion and begin implementation as soon as possible. We will also discuss with the UN the humanitarian contributions needed to ease the suffering of our neighbors in Yemen.

- We continue to work on implementing these steps at a time when our cities and our citizens face a continued assault by ballistic missiles at the hands of the Iranian-backed Houthi militia. In this comprehensive humanitarian operation; we seek to lift the injustice and oppression that these Iranian-supported militias are placing on the people of Yemen. We will not allow the Iranian-backed Houthi militia to continue to dominate and loot the humanitarian aid and commercial shipments and use them in their assault on the people of Yemen

**Operational Statement by the Spokesperson for the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen, Colonel Turki Al Maliki**

The Threat of Ballistic Missiles:

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels pose a direct threat to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The Iranianbacked Houthi militia threaten the Kingdom’s territory both through missile launches and through attempts by militants to penetrate the border on foot in mountainous areas. o He confirmed that the missiles fired at Riyadh were produced in Iran.  
These missiles were not previously present in Yemen. o He confirmed that at least ballistic 83 missiles have been fired into the Kingdom’s territory. o He reiterated that Iranian-supplied missiles are a security threat for the region, as well as, a growing number of countries, such as Lebanon and Europe.  
Humanitarian Aid Access:

- Col. Al Maliki reiterated that goods are continuing to enter Yemen even after the first missile launch into Riyadh:

o AIR ENTRY: Nov 13-Dec 20 -- 340 permits for aid delivery at 5 airports. 196 tons of cargo. o SEA ENTRY: Nov 13-Dec 20 – 259 permits issued, 435,051 tons of food and 296 tons of medical; including fuel supplies.

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that the Iranian-backed Houthi leadership continuously refuse to accept proposals from the UN Special Envoy for inspection protocols or independent administration of the Port of Hodeidah.  

Targeting Procedures and Military Operations:

- Col. Al Maliki also mentioned that Coalition airstrikes are based on intelligence and extensive monitoring and surveillance, to ensure all targets are military installations and to avoid civilian casualties.

- He reiterated that targeting is specific, clear, and legal. o Extensive precautions are taken to avoid civilian areas, especially where women and children are present.

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that some strikes are made at the request of the Yemeni Armed Forces. o Examples of facilities targeted include weapons factories, storage facilities, training camps, air defense assets, and coastal radar threatening Red Sea ships.

- Forces of Yemen’s legitimate authorities control 85% of the territory.

- More than 11,000 Houthi fighters have been killed since the operation began.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

Requested for UNHCR’s initial emergency response  


**Operational Context**

**Arrivals and border movements**

Since 25 August this year some 655,000 refugees have fled targeted violence and serious human rights violations in Rakhine State, Myanmar. UNHCR estimates that average arrival rates have dropped from 745 per day in November to 100 per day so far this month.  

UNHCR identified more than 40 border points used by refugees to cross into Bangladesh since the start of the crisis. Currently, refugees arrive mainly through two entry points - Sabrang and Anjumanpara. The availability of boats, boat fares, information provided by relatives on previous crossings, presence of landmines, and border surveillance generally determine the points of crossing.  

The Government and people of Bangladesh have shown extraordinary generosity in keeping the country’s borders open and shared their resources with refugees from Myanmar. Newly arrived refugees are settling in the border areas in the south-east of Bangladesh, in Cox’s Bazar, where an estimated 307,500 refugees were already living. The vast majority are staying in a large and densely populated settlement called Kutupalong. The terrain of the camps is hilly and prone to landslides, flooding, whilst proximity to the coast also makes the area prone to cyclones. Weather conditions, the challenging terrain, and the lack of roads limit access to the refugees, especially those living in more remote areas of the spontaneous settlements. UNHCR has funded a road to ensure better access, working closely with Bangladesh’s armed forces.  

**Refugee population and protection needs**

In order to develop a better understanding of the refugee population and of their needs UNHCR launched a family counting exercise. This exercise will aim to complement the Government’s on-going registration efforts. UNHCR teams have identified family composition in its counting exercise and gathered other information that will assist with response efforts. This exercise is proving instrumental in the development and implementation of protection activities and the provision of targeted assistance.  

Of the 753,238 individuals counted, the majority (69%) are from Maungdaw, while 24% are from Buthidaung in northern Rakhine State, Myanmar. Some 52% are women or girls, while 54% are children under 18 years of age. A significant number of families (31%) have at least one member who has specific needs, including single mothers (16%), serious medical conditions (4%), elderly people (4%), and people with disability (5%), among others.  

UNHCR is working closely with the Government of Bangladesh and partners to provide protection and assistance to the refugees and to support host populations affected by the influx. The Office also continues to work to develop sites in the extended areas of Kutupalong along with ensuring that basic infrastructure is in place where refugees settle.  

On 23 November, the Governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a bilateral ‘arrangement’ on the return of refugees to Myanmar. UNHCR continues to engage with both governments outlining UNHCR’s established role in voluntary return processes, why it is important as a means of ensuring refugee concerns are represented, and to address the most pressing aspects of the arrangement, including its scope, timeframe, conditions, and any other criteria that will help it meet international standards for voluntary return. Refugees will need accurate information in order to make their own well-informed choices on voluntary return to Myanmar. Based on the reports of Rohingya refugees arriving in Bangladesh and of human rights organization, conditions in Myanmar’s Rakhine State are not yet conducive to enable safe and sustainable return for many refugees. Confidence-building measures will be required on the ground in Rakhine State as well as other measures, such as unhindered access for UNHCR to conduct protection monitoring of refugee returns.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

2387474,"Mali - Humanitarian Brief (December 2017) More than five years after the escalation of conflict in northern Mali, progress has stagnated and new momentum is required to avoid a significant setback in Mali's recovery. The signature of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in 2015 opened a unique window of opportunity, but the Malian peace process has fallen short of expectations as implementation of the agreement remains delayed. Communities whose lives were shattered by the conflict have not yet seen tangible progress and remain highly vulnerable.

**INCREASING HUMANITARIAN NEEDS**

In 2017, the resurgence of intercommunal violence and clashes between armed groups triggered displacements and disrupted the livelihoods of thousands of families. Several communities affected by the conflict still struggle to access food, water, healthcare, education, protection and livelihood opportunities. In some areas, the persisting insecurity continues to prevent the deployment of State and development actors. For many families, humanitarian actors are the sole providers of essential services. The conflict has further exacerbated the vulnerability of communities, whose capacity to withstand shocks has been eroded by repetitive droughts, foods, epidemics and chronic poverty. Mali ranks 175 out of 188 countries in the Human Development Index.  

Emergency aid remains necessary to save lives and facilitate recovery. Government and development partners' efforts to address the root causes of chronic food insecurity, malnutrition and structural problems in the delivery of basic services will take years to demonstrate tangible results.  

In 2018, 4.1 million people, representing 22% of the Malian population, will be food insecure (up from 3.8 million in 2017), including 800,000 people who will require urgent food assistance.  
Malnutrition remains a serious concern, with 165,000 children projected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, and 115,000 pregnant or lactating women requiring nutrition assistance. In Mali, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 10.7% and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) rate of 2.6% exceed the emergency thresholds established by the World Health Organization of 10% and 2% for GAM and SAM, respectively.  

In addition, 908,000 million Malians, largely in northern regions, need water, sanitation and hygiene assistance. Lack of access to potable water constitutes a risk for conflict, as communities compete for limited water resources for themselves, but also for livestock and agricultural activities.  

About 500 schools (up from 300 during the same period last year) remain closed in central and northern Mali, and 2,700 teachers have not returned or been deployed to their posts due to insecurity and the influence of extremist groups opposing education. Central Mali is particularly affected with 277 schools closed in the Mopti region.  

Non-functional schools will affect the education of 300,000 children. Out of school children that cannot reintegrate the education system are exposed to higher recruitment risks by non-state armed actors and criminal groups.

UNHCR is bracing for further displacement and a spike in humanitarian needs as hostilities intensify in frontline areas on Yemen’s west coast. This follows the recent fighting in the capital, Sana’a, and neighbouring northern governorates. Over the past number of days, UNHCR has received reports of new displacement from Hudaydah and Taizz Governorates. UNHCR and partners are still assessing the situation, but initial reports are that more than 1,400 people have fled from Taizz and Hudaydah to locations in Southern Taizz and Lahj. With numbers expected to rise further, UNHCR is working with partners to support and help those fleeing, with emergency relief items for 2,000 families in Hudaydah, and a further 2,000 aid kits are on their way along with 2,000 emergency shelter kits.  

Meanwhile, following recent clashes, the situation in Sana’a has returned to relative calm, with UN humanitarian flights resuming a reduced service. UNHCR offices in Sana'a reopened as of this week with a core team of international staff, and is working with partners to resume humanitarian operations that were put on hold due to insecurity in early December. As a matter of urgency, UNHCR is restoring services where possible and resuming assistance for the most vulnerable IDP and refugee families, particularly a winter cash assistance programme aimed at 17,000 families.  

On 17 December, humanitarian organizations in Yemen issued a statement emphasizing neutrality and condemning any allegations of corruption and bias in the provision of relief assistance by parties to the conflict. UNHCR continues to work to serve the growing needs of those in Yemen and advocates for a political solution to put an end to the suffering.

Three months after Hurricane Maria struck Dominica as a Category 5 hurricane, the Government and humanitarian actors continue to work together to address the needs of the most affected. Even though the situation is normalising throughout the country, Dominica remains seriously impacted. Over 80 percent of houses still have inadequate roofing, many children have not yet returned to school, 90 per cent of the population still does not have electricity, and a sizeable portion of the population is highly vulnerable due to the loss of their main source of livelihoods.  

Humanitarian actors are transitioning from relief to recovery-oriented activities and coordination mechanisms are reflecting this shift. A growing number of ministries and partners take part in sector coordination mechanisms, which is conducive to more comprehensive and complementary action plans. The Ministry of Planning has taken over multi-sector coordination from the Emergency Operations Centre.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

- IDPs and returnees lack access to adequate services, livelihoods 

- USAID/OFDA provides support to vulnerable populations in Marawi and surrounding areas

**KEY DEVELOPMENTS**

- On October 23, the Government of the Philippines (GPH) announced the end of the five-month offensive against Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-affiliated armed groups in Marawi, the capital city of Lanao del Sur Province in the Philippines’ Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The GPH and relief actors are responding to continued humanitarian needs among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees. As of December 3, the GPH had registered nearly 354,000 IDPs.

- Of the 354,000 registered IDPs, approximately 97,000 had returned to Marawi as of December 10, according to the GPH Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). However, the GPH continues to restrict returns to the most-affected barangays—the smallest administrative divisions in the Philippines—due to widespread damage and destruction of homes and ongoing protection risks.

- Lack of basic services and livelihood opportunities in Marawi continue to hinder IDP returns. In addition, relief actors report that displaced populations residing in informal sites and host communities lack sufficient access to basic services.

- In FY 2017, USAID/OFDA provided $3 million to address the multi-sector needs of vulnerable populations in Marawi and neighboring areas, including through the provision of protection, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

- The resettlement of Barbuda residents has not gone according to plan with only 34 per cent of the population signaling an intent to return from Antigua in the short-term; the main ferry service being out of operation and a decision that the previously state-funded passage (US$ 72 round trip) will now be borne directly by passengers.

- In Dominica, only eight per cent of people, mainly those living in the cities of Roseau and Portsmouth, have access to electricity. In the British Virgin Islands (BVI) only one-fifth of the population has restored power.

- Since the launch of the programme on 4 December, approximately 1,120 children from a target population of 6,000 vulnerable children and their families have been reached with the UNICEF-supported Emergency Cash Transfer Programme in Dominica.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

With the holiday season approaching, increasing pockets of population in hurricane-ravaged countries continue to see a gradual return to normalcy; but a large segment of the population is still struggling. While critical services, such as water, were restored to between 70 and 90 per cent of people (British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands, respectively), the return of electricity has been at a much slower rate. As of 13 December 2017, over 90 per cent of the population in Dominica was without electricity, while 80 per cent of the residents in British Virgin Islands and 40 per cent in Anguilla remain without power.  

The education sector continues to make strides to return to normal, even as a shift system and temporary learning spaces - such as UNICEF-provided tents - continue to be utilised. School enrolment figures in Antigua (Barbuda), Anguilla and Turks and Caicos Islands have reached or surpassed pre-hurricane levels, reflecting some movement between the islands, especially from Dominica. In Dominica, 94 per cent of all public-owned or funded pre-schools, primary and secondary schools have reopened, with an attendance rate of 68 per cent, according to pre-hurricane enrolment figures. However, considering migration trends since the hurricane,it is expected that the school-age population currently residing on the island is below the 18 September 2017 figure.  

The expected resettlement of Barbuda residents currently in Antigua, remains a critical concern. According to the *Intent to Return* survey conducted by IOM, only 34 per cent of approximately 1,600 people, want to return in the short term. The means of transportation from Antigua to the smaller sister island is also doubtful, with the main ferry being out of service, and a decision that Government will no longer bear the cost of the passage.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"
2385989,"Q&A: Are humanitarian aid agencies approaching communications all wrong? *A report from Internews finds that Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh don't feel they have enough information to make good decisions and many say they are unable to communicate with aid providers.*

BANGKOK — By continuing to treat communication as an afterthought, humanitarian aid agencies are failing to adequately pass on vital information to Rohingya refugees now dispersed in camps and informal settlements throughout Cox’s Bazar, according to a [recent report](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/information-needs-assessment-coxs-bazar-bangladesh) from [Internews](https://www.devex.com/organizations/internews-network-5957). It is a problem hardly confined to the most recent refugee crisis, warned Internews Senior Director for Humanitarian Programs Anahi Ayala Iacucci, and one with global implications.

When a largely illiterate refugee population balloons from well over 200,000 to 1 million in three months, communication quickly becomes as crucial as it is challenging. And in Bangladesh, humanitarian aid groups are currently communicating with affected communities about services such as food distributions and vaccinations any way they can — through staff at physical hubs, pictorial messaging, and door-to-door visits with interpreters.

But more than three-quarters of the Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar feel they don’t have enough information to make good decisions, and almost two-thirds said they are unable to communicate with aid providers, according to Internews’ interviews with individual refugees and focus groups.

**Aid groups 'desperate' to communicate effectively with 1 million Rohingya refugees** 

The current suite of ad hoc communications strategies in Cox's Bazar reflects an aid community unprepared for the rapid growth of a city-sized refugee camp. But communication challenges have also been compounded by the low literacy rate of the refugee population, the complexities of the Rohingya language, and a surge of aid groups unfamiliar with the local context.

The report paints a broader picture of a humanitarian sector that still treats communication as an afterthought — or relies on feedback channels preferred by the humanitarian community, rather than by the affected population. The lack of functional feedback mechanisms is one pain point in particular that Iacucci feels needs to be addressed immediately in order carry out projects that deliver for communities.

In the meantime, in the absence of trusted sources of accurate and consistent information, rumors and misinformation can fill in the gaps and exacerbate a crisis, leading people to make poor decisions or leaving them vulnerable to violence, trafficking, and radicalization — all issues that Iacucci feels are very valid concerns right now in Bangladesh.

Devex spoke with Iacucci about what she deems a more fundamental problem in the humanitarian community’s approach to communications — one that leaves room for propaganda and doesn’t answer to community members’ needs. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

**_What are some of the biggest dangers of a lack of information or misinformation in Cox’s Bazar right now?_**

The biggest trend that we’ve seen there is that the lack of a place that provides meaningful targeted and verified information makes it a lot easier for people who have the intention of spreading a certain type of propaganda within the youth, especially in the Rohingya society, to actually provide them with alternative information. And one of the things that we've seen is a rise of fake news on social media that is specifically aiming at increasing the emotional impact of the ethnic cleansing that is happening in Myanmar. Some of the fake news that we have seen moving around on the Internet is specifically targeting Rohingya youth and providing them with an alternative to just sitting there and being passive receivers of this, and actually trying to instigate them to either become more radicalized or become more actively involved in the fight against the Myanmar government.

> “[Communication] is a complex mechanism that needs to be overlaid on top of the overall humanitarian response. It’s not an add-on, it’s not a cherry on top of the cake, it’s the dough.” — Anahi Ayala Iacucci, senior director for humanitarian programs at Internews

That is for me a very big danger, and it’s a danger that’s a bit subtle. It all spills down to a much larger issue, which is the fundamental lack of trust for humanitarian organizations. Because, as you can imagine, if you arrive in a place and you expect to find some sort of relief and then everything gets complicated, you don't know where to go, you don’t know who to talk to, very few people speak your language, then you start becoming increasingly frustrated with the community that is supposed to serve you, which is the humanitarian community.

**_And one takeaway from the Internews report is that the majority of aid workers aren’t trusted or viewed as a good source of information. Where do you go from there? How do you start to change that?_**

We need to make sure that if we are not the ones providing information, someone else has that information to provide to them. You're not necessarily going to be able to build that confidence that will allow the community in the next six months to come to your humanitarian organization to ask for information. But what you can do is to make sure that you give that right information to the people that they already trust.

If they already trust the religious leaders and the friends and family members and the Mahzis [an elected leader in the community who represents up to 200 families], or whoever it is, then use them — but make sure you give them the right information so when they are asked questions by the community, they are able to provide that information in a good way.

**_What are some of the main reasons you would point to as to why information provision is so difficult in Cox’s Bazar specifically right now?_**

Well, I don't believe it's very difficult.

**_Really? That’s what I’m hearing from most everyone I’ve interviewed — that this context in particular is so much more difficult communication-wise than others?_**

I’ve seen some of the logistical issues around it, I personally do not think that this is particularly difficult. I just think that first of all, as usual, the humanitarian community is not ready for it. We don't have anyone that speaks their language.

For me, the point is there is no capacity on the ground, I mean you've been there, but I can tell you from what I've seen, the majority of people that do communication with communities in Cox’s Bazar have been hired on short-term consultancy contracts. They come in for two or three months, try to help organizations figure out what do to do, and then they leave. So first there is no investment from the humanitarian community into communication with communities. The investment that exists is sporadic and ad hoc: “Let’s hire a consultant for two, three months so they can help us figure it out,” but this is not how it works. This is a complex mechanism that needs to be overlaid on top of the overall humanitarian response. It’s not an add-on, it’s not a cherry on top of the cake, it’s the dough.

**_The report also touched on humanitarians not viewing refugees as information resources. Tell me more about feedback mechanisms — or lack of them — in the camps._**

The emphasis that has been placed in the last year or six months on the fact that the humanitarian community wants to set up accountability systems for themselves — I don't think it’s working.

> “A good feedback mechanism is one that involves the community in the design and in thinking through the process of implementing humanitarian assistance.”

The majority of the way these organization are building feedback mechanisms — and we've reviewed some of them — is that they put an information point in the camp, people walk in, and they ask: “Are you happy or not happy?” Yes or no. And that's the feedback mechanism, but that's not how it works. A truly “[Communicating with Communities](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ocha-message-communications-communities)” feedback mechanism means that you discuss an issue with the community. That's how you get feedback. You discuss how its designed, how it’s built, what’s your intended outcome. And you have that open conversation with the community so the community has an ongoing dialogue with you.

And on the other side, you are not the one that should be evaluating if you're doing a good job or not. Right now, we are in discussion with [BBC Media Action](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction) and [Translators without Borders](https://translatorswithoutborders.org/) about setting up a common feedback mechanism, and if we manage to do it, it would be the first time where the organization doing a common feedback mechanism will not be the same organization that is providing services.

**_So collecting feedback should be in the form of group meetings, or community meetings?_**

It can be group meetings or community meetings, or it can also be individual surveys, but the problem is if you do individual feedback, you need to answer to every one of them. You can't just collect the feedback and then not answer. The most important thing is you need to act on the feedback. A good feedback mechanism is one that involves the community in the design and in thinking through the process of implementing humanitarian assistance.

**_And this mechanism that you and Translators without Borders and BBC Media Action are working on?_**

The whole idea is to look at the already existing feedback mechanism and revise them and teach a humanitarian organization how to make really true feedback loops. It's literally building the capacity of humanitarian organizations that are really spending money to set up information hubs or whatever it might be and really teach them: “OK you want to spend money and you want to put in resources, this is great.” Let us teach you how to actually do it properly rather than having a ticked box and saying, “Well you know I have an information hub in the camp, so I'm done with communication with communities.”

**_Then what?_**

And that's the other thing. If you get feedback from the community and you informed the community into your programs, then you need to have flexibility both on the budget side and on the programmatic side to adapt your programs to the feedback. So if you decide you're going to build seven schools and the community comes back and say we don't want seven schools we want three schools and four clinics, you need to have a mechanism to be able to go back to your donors and say actually we discussed this with the community and we think we should do three schools and two clinics … Then the donor needs to give you the flexibility to be able to do that right. So I think that until people really understand that communication with communities is supposed to have an impact on your program design and implementation, then it's going to be really hard for them to do it and they find it really difficult.

We also need people to be a lot more aware about all of the potential that they're missing here to make changes.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"
2385889,"UNFPA Response in Yemen: Monthly Situation Report #11 - November 2017 **HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MONTH**

On 6 November, ‘temporary’ closure of all of Yemen’s airports, seaports and land crossings took effect, disrupting the delivery of humanitarian assistance to 27 million people. UNFPA and all humanitarian actors called for the borders to be re-opened and flights to be resumed, stressing that continued closure will sharply aggravate humanitarian crisis in Yemen and bring millions of people in Yemen closer to starvation and death. Of particular concern was on the lives of 52,800 pregnant women who risk complications with immediate danger to their lives if they do not get urgent life-saving maternal care and medicines.

While some sea and airports were opened following two weeks of complete closure, the humanitarian crisis has continued to aggravate posing a critical threat to the lives of millions already struggling to survive. Due to limited funding, humanitarian agencies are only able to target one third of the population (7 million), while some two thirds of the population rely on commercially imported supplies, making the continued availability of commodities in the markets essential in preventing an unprecedented famine in Yemen.

UNFPA's response in Yemen has so far reached over 2 million people with reproductive health and gender-based violence services and information.

Support in November included treatment of 46 fistula cases in Sana'a and Aden.'Mama kits' containing items for the hygiene and protection of mother's and their newborns were provided to maternity units across 8 governorates. In addition, 118 unemployed midwives are being assisted to operated private home-based clinics, providing critical life-saving maternal health services to pregnant women and women of childbearing age.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

Military operations to retake the remaining western Anbar districts under the control of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) ended in mid-November. Around 22,000 people have been reported as newly-displaced since the Anbar campaign began in September 20171 .An interagency assessment mission indicated shortage of basic services with drinking water, health care, household items and winter clothing reported as the most pressing humanitarian needs. The total number of displaced has dropped below 3 million people for the first time since 2014. Although over 2.6 million people have returned home, many locations have suffered significant conflict damage, and local authorities may not offer basic services, including water and sanitation, primary healthcare, or education.  

Protection concerns remain for people returning to areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance, and on the voluntary nature of returns. On 12 November, northeast Iraq experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 on the Richter scale, per the United States Geological Survey (USGS), with the epicentre on the Iranian side of the Iran-Iraq border. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) reported nine fatalities and over 550 people injured, with most affected districts being Darbandikhan, Halabja, and Garmiyan. The Darbandikhan Dam on the Diyala River was impacted by landslides that partially blocked the spillway and caused structural damage. Immediate need for shelter and warm clothes were reported, and 108 schools were damaged, at least 16 of them badly.UNICEF participated in joint OCHA-led assessments, and a UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team specialized in natural disasters arrived within four days at the request of the Government of Iraq (GoI). Smaller-scale aftershocks of 4 to 4.5 on the Richter scale continued throughout the month.  
Despite growing international pressure and some concessions offered by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), tensions between the federal Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government have not yet been resolved. Although humanitarian access across KRG and federal internal borders has improved since October, in some areas alternative routes are needed to avoid high-risk areas. Concerns about waterborne disease outbreaks remain high. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF are monitoring and responding with Ministry of Health (MoH),  
Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and relevant ministries.  

**Humanitarian leadership and coordination** 

UNICEF leads the WASH Cluster, co-leads the Education cluster with Save the Children International, leads the Child Protection sub-cluster and Nutrition working group, and is an active member of the Health cluster. UNICEF, UNFPA, and WFP coordinate the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) Consortium serving IDPs, and the Multi-Sector Emergency Package (MSEP), delivering aid in retaken areas. In November, the child protection sub-cluster finalised a ‘Minimum Package for Child Protection in urban newly-retaken locations’. This guidance focuses on a community-based approach, including integration between CP and education. UNICEF, UNHCR, and WHO coordinate with relevant line Ministries through the Cholera Taskforce, led by the MoH.  

**Humanitarian Strategy** 

Humanitarian action complements recovery and stabilization activities by enhancing preparedness and response capacity of State institutions and local actors. Under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), strategic priorities are to: reach as many people in need as possible across Iraq by securing safe access to front-line and newly retaken areas; facilitate and advocate for voluntary, safe, and dignified returns; give options to families to live in Iraq in dignity by expanding resilience and social cohesion programmes; and help people affected by violence recover by providing specialized protection assistance. In support of the national response, humanitarian partners are expected to simultaneously respond to both mass displacement and mass returns. The development of the Iraq 2018 HRP is ongoing. With the 2018 Cluster strategies finalised, partners’ projects are submitted to Clusters, and will be reviewed in early December, after which cluster portfolios will be presented to the HRP Advisory Board.",4598,"Logistics and Telecommunications"

From 15 to 18 December, a total of 45 participants from Government agencies, including the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) and the Oromia Disaster Prevention Preparedness Committee (ODPPC), as well as United Nations agencies, NGOs and private sector companies will participate in the training, covering several simulation exercises, held in Adama, Oromia Region.

As a world leader in humanitarian logistics, WFP’s objective is to help prepare skilled staff from various agencies and organizations to make rapid, informed decisions at the onset of an emergency or natural disaster. Participants will improve their ability to provide immediate operational logistics response capacity, identify challenges and implement quick, effective solutions to deliver life-saving food assistance.

“The Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia strongly believes that natural disasters can be effectively addressed if targeted interventions are practiced through preparedness measures,” said Tadesse Bekele Fanta, Senior Disaster Risk Management Adviser, NDRMC.

“We continue to engage in a strong partnership with WFP, towards the full implementation of the Government’s Disaster Response Management policy, which focuses on risk reduction activities and emergency preparedness. Towards this end, timely response is crucial in minimizing risks and strengthening supply chain capacity.”

During the training, WFP will organize real-life simulations that teach participants about possible challenges they can face in a logistics response – by analyzing key components such as transport and storage, and how to solve such challenges.

“Our aim is to provide disaster management participants with the opportunity to review their level of preparedness, practice their response, and improve their decision-making process,” said Peter Schaller, Deputy Country Director for WFP Ethiopia. “Together with the NDRMC, we will work together to strengthen national systems for rapid, cost-efficient and effective emergency response – and ultimately, to save lives when disaster strikes.”

**Khartoum, 20 December 2017**. A new £31.5 million multi-year contribution from the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) is helping the humanitarian community in Sudan provide life-saving support to millions in need of assistance.

Through the flexible Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF), a multi-donor pool fund managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the United Kingdom funding supports Sudan’s most critically vulnerable populations in times of need and plays a vital emergency response role in close coordination with the Government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission.

“There are significant shortfalls in the funding required to address the humanitarian needs in Sudan, which makes responding to new emergencies difficult and puts lives at risk. This additional contribution by the United Kingdom will enable humanitarian agencies to continue to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance by meeting the needs of the most vulnerable people, and helps the International Community to play its role in supporting the Government to respond,” said Dr. Christopher Pycroft, the Head of DFID in Sudan.

DFID has been steadfast in its backing to the SHF since its inception, and its latest contribution comes at a critical time. As a strategic fund, the SHF constitutes 8 per cent of the funding available to humanitarian partners in Sudan, and plays a vital role in providing an effective, coordinated, prioritised and principled humanitarian response.

The United Kingdom will provide an additional £11.5 million for 2017, which is their second contribution to the SHF this year. Multi-year funding provides a measure of flexibility in countries where humanitarian scenarios may change year-on-year, allowing donors to engage in programmes that may cause longer term impact and reduce aid dependency. 

The donation from the United Kingdom boosts Sudan’s $804 million Humanitarian Response Plan 2017 (HRP 2017), currently closing the year with a 55% funding shortfall. “We are extremely grateful for the support from the United Kingdom. In light of the significant funding gaps this year, this second allocation is a testament to its commitment to the people of Sudan and the humanitarian community,” said Mr. Selva Ramachandran,

The move to transit from emergency relief to greater integration-focused and longer term (and more sustainable) programmes continues to be reinforced with the development of an Operational Plan for Greece (pending approval) in 2018. The Emergency Appeal will run alongside the Operational Plan for the first half of 2018, after which the EA will be closed.

**A. Situation analysis**

**Description of the disaster**

Two years after the beginning of the migration crisis (in 2015), around 45,614 migrants remain on the mainland (32,158) and islands (13,456) of Greece, according to figures as of end of September by UNHCR.3 Compared to previous years, arrivals to Greece in 2017 have significantly decreased.  
However, during August and September 2017 there was a significant increase which created a critical situation of overcrowding in the Reception and Identification Centres (RICs) of the islands.  
In October 2017, UNHCR and other organisations in Greece have urged action on the islands to ease overcrowding, improve shelter, and stock and distribute appropriate and sufficient aid items. Nearly 5,000 refugees, mostly Syrian or Iraqi families, crossed from Turkey in September - a quarter of all arrivals this year.4 While that is a fraction of the nearly 1 million who arrived in 2015 - due to a European Union statement with Turkey - four of the five island camps are hosting two or three times as many people as they were designed for. In the RIC of Lesvos, Moria, for example, 1,500 people are currently living in makeshift tents with no insulation which raises concerns over the approaching of winter.5 The ‘Financial Plan 2017’ agreed between Greek and EU representatives (DG Home and DG ECHO) in February 2017 established that, with the exception of ECHO’s funding for alternative accommodation spaces and cash transfer programmes, provision of services in the island’s RICs is a responsibility of the Greek government with the EU financial support to the national programmes. 

While conditions on the camps in the mainland has improved as compared to the previous year, there continues to be a substantial number of protection challenges in Greece. Some, for example those linked to the lack of security and registration in camps, are longstanding and not able to be resolved in the absence of meaningful action by the Greek government. Other challenges are also emerging as populations transition into urban environments. Populations in camps, particularly in the islands, continue to experience overcrowding and inadequate standards of accommodation, ranging from tents to caravans shared with strangers and without adequate locks and other security mechanisms. There are frequent reports of both actual and apprehended violence from camp based populations, with rumours fuelling more fear, concern and community tensions. There is in general a lack of security in camps, and at many sites entry and egress are not controlled. Camp residents find that people come into the camp from outside completely unimpeded, often for the purpose of drugs, crime, sex work, and other problematic activities. People within camps, particularly women and children, are very afraid to move around at night as they do not know who is in the camp. There has been no MoMP registration in camps for many months (since May). People have continued to arrive in camps, resulting in large unregistered populations. These people cannot have access to cash, so are reliant on savings, generosity from friends and neighbours, or other sources of income in order to meet their basic needs.  
The lack of registration also means that people cannot be allocated a caravan officially, which is fuelling an exploitative black market whereby community leaders allocate caravans in return for payments amounting to hundreds of euros. 

From January until September (included) 2017 a total of 42,495 applications for international protection have been submitted to the Greek Asylum Service. The main countries of origins of asylum-seekers who have submitted an asylum application in 2017 were from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.6 In September 2017 the government stated that 10 camps out of the 20 will be closed by the end of the year and that the government will be responsible for managing healthcare related services in the camps from January 2018, further decreasing the role of NGOs in this context. Additionally, the aim is to move all migrants into rental accommodation schemes (by the end of 2018) instead of retaining the ‘camp based accommodation’ strategy. The UNHCR and its partners presented in July 2017 the newly launched Emergency Support to Integration & Accommodation programme (ESTIA)7 of the EU Humanitarian Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Directorate General, which aims to assist refugees and their families rent urban accommodation and provide them with cash assistance.  

Therefore, the fact that many people are now (or soon to be accommodated) in urban areas and that the EU Relocation programme ended in September 2017, leaves most people in Greece bound to live in the country, thus the need of integration services throughout the country is crucial. Facilitation of migrants and refugees to access public hospitals or public services to receive health insurance and tax numbers, language courses and access to the local job market are only some of the most important integration actions that need to be further explored and acted on.  

Therefore, while the urgency of meeting the basic needs for the new asylum seekers and migrants will continue, the more substantial question will be how to ensure that both basic needs of recognized refugees, as well as their inclusion and integration can be met by the services provided by, or through, the Greek government in the long run. This need will be most pronounced in the urban areas, which now host the majority of the migrant and refugee population.  

In general terms, the Emergency Appeal will focus on meeting the basic needs of the migrants, while the Annual Plan will emphasize the longer-term needs of migrants, as well as vulnerable Greeks, and where these two populations meet.

2393344,"Mine Action and Confidence-Building: Harnessing Trust for Conflict Prevention in Colombia _Adriana Erthal Abdenur, in San Vicente del Caguán, Caquetá, Colombia_

Christmas preparations are in full swing at the church offices in San Vicente del Caguán, in the department of Caquetá.  Groups of children sit cross-legged on the patio, cutting stars out of shiny construction paper and hanging ornaments on the bushes.  In a small meeting room, I sit down to speak with Sonia (not her real name), one of the community leaders for mine action.

Sonia is young, but—like San Vicente as a whole—exhausted by war.  In the early 2000s, San Vicente became the epicenter of a [failed peace process](http://centromemoria.gov.co/proceso-de-paz-del-caguan/)between the FARC and the government, in which the creation of a cease-fire zone allowed the guerrilla to regroup.  To stop the Army operations in the area, the guerrilla planted hundreds of anti-personnel mines around the town and its surrounding fields.  The area remains one of the most intensely contaminated areas of Colombia (itself among the countries with the highest number of landmines and explosive remnants of war, ERW). Coming into San Vicente, I had seen the demining operations by the side of the road, with Army specialists in full protective gear perched tensely over small squares of soil, patiently combing the soil for casings.   My local guide had pointed at the dense overgrowth covering vast fields–fertile land left fallow due to the suspicion there are still landmines.

Since the final agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC was signed, in December 2016, demining efforts have intensified in this part of Colombia, with [the Army and eight agencies](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/municipios-asignados.aspx) working in priority areas.  Yet accidents continue to happen.  The day before my visit with Sonia, a farmer had one of his legs blown off under the knee when he stepped on a mine in a nearby field.  “He was airlifted by the Army,” says Sonia, noting that his community just recently had been identified for mine action.

Sonia recounts the successes, but also mentions the need to build confidence.  The government broadcasts images of villagers playing football matches on decontaminated fields, but in reality the locals won’t step on that land until they have tested it the old-fashioned way: by sending their cattle to graze on it.“  I ask Sonia whether she herself would walk across one of the demined fields. She pauses. “No.”

When asked why, she reminds me that decontaminated land is said to be free of suspicion of mines, rather than free of mines, and that there is still work to be done on build the local population’s confidence in the process. The impact of mines/ERW is predicated not only on the destructive, even lethal capacity of the explosives, but also on the more generalized fear that vital areas may be contaminated, which prevent entire communities from cultivating land, building essential infrastructure, or accessing vital resources. While it takes little effort to spread fear through mines, [substantial investment is required in trust and confidence-building](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12096848) to minimize that fear.

Yet peace process stakeholders and peacebuilders can also leverage this link between mines and trust to create new dialogue spaces, both during peace talks and during their implementation. Demining, in other words, can present unique opportunities for confidence building among warring parties, in part because mine clearance is often needed in order to implement a local ceasefire or other localized actions even during negotiations. In the FARC process, for instance, demining became the first bilateral point in de-escalation, in order to implement a local cease-fire.   Demining thus required that the Colombian military and the FARC guerrillas collaborate directly, setting a precedent for further cooperation.   Demining, in fact, became one of the main topics around which the agreements were organized, and [is the object of an entire agreement](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/acuerdo/Paginas/Acuerdo-sobre-limpieza-y-descontaminacion.aspx).

After the final agreement was signed, in December 2017, humanitarian mine action (HMA) was among the immediate priorities. A body was set up to [issue a strategy](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/Desminado-Humanitario.aspx) and guidelines following international standards, and the Colombian demining oversight body began working with eight demining agencies (as well as the Organization for American States) to survey, map, and demine vast priority areas.

For locals in the countryside—the areas most directly affected by the conflict—one major trust issue relates to the effectiveness of demining, especially when different types of artifacts are buried at different depths. But trust also implies the credibility of institutions, from the agencies to the government bodies overseeing them. In turn, attaining this confidence requires building an ongoing relationship with local actors, at both individual and institutional levels. As in many other contexts, demining agencies working in Colombia carry out non-technical surveys that include consultations with local communities, and that incorporate locals—including women—into their teams.  Demining agencies are also required to establish an _enlace_—a key person that links the agency and the community and that facilitates the flow of information in both directions. When properly established and maintained, these channels allow for the community to voice concerns from beginning to end of process.

Equally important are the level and capacity of community’s own proactive involvement in the process.  In parts of Colombia, local and regional groups have become proactive in mine action, especially in awareness-raising efforts and in identifying demands and concerns.  This participation allows communities to become familiar with the modus operandi of different agencies. Ideally, it can also create communication channels across communities on the demining process, helping to identify challenges and share solutions.

However, there is still work to be done. In this part of Colombia, community leaders complain that there are not enough _enlaces_.  This gap undercuts the exchange of information, which is vital not only to the agencies (which rely in part on popular knowledge to identify mined areas) but also to the communities, who continue to suffer casualties and live in fear even as mine action efforts are undertaken elsewhere.  In some instances, agencies can undermine trust.  Near her hometown, notes Sonia, one agency has divulged who planted the explosives. “This information can reignite resentment among groups,” she notes. “We need to demine without focusing on who did what, otherwise it becomes hard to break the cycle of distrust and resentment.”

Matching agencies to local communities can also be part of this process.  The agreement with the FARC establishes that [ex-combatants also participate in demining](http://caracol.com.co/radio/2017/02/04/nacional/1486166835_366877.html). Sonia assures me that there are communities in Caquetá that in fact would prefer to have the ex-combatants decontaminating their land.  “They know one another,” she says. “And you can’t demine without trust.”

Following the [recommitment to cease fire](https://reliefweb.int/node/2390589), the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations in Donetsk region and a similar number of ceasefire violations in Luhansk region between the evenings of 22 and 23 December compared with the previous reporting period. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations in Donetsk region compared with the previous 24 hours and no ceasefire violations in Luhansk region. The SMM recorded more ceasefire violations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions between the evenings of 24 and 25 December compared with the previous 24 hours, but fewer compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December. The Mission followed up on reports of a civilian injured along the contact line near Berezove and observed damage to residential areas of Pavlopil and Yasynuvata assessed as caused by shelling. The SMM continued monitoring the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske; it recorded a ceasefire violation inside the Stanytsia Luhanska area. The SMM’s access remained restricted in all three areas and elsewhere, including at two “DPR” weapons storage sites. The Mission observed weapons in violation near Poltavka. The SMM visited five border areas beyond government control. In Kyiv, the SMM monitored four gatherings in the city centre.

In Donetsk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 of December, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations[1], including about 200 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 320 explosions). About 40 per cent of these violations, including about 140 explosions, were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December, mostly in the area between government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk) and “DPR”-controlled Debaltseve (58km north-east of Donetsk). Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations, including fewer explosions (18), compared with the previous 24 hours. Between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, although the SMM recorded more ceasefire violations (including 14 explosions) compared with the previous 24 hours, there were significantly fewer ceasefire violations compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, nine projectiles in flight from west to east and two projectiles from east to west, followed by a total of two undetermined explosions and 42 projectiles (42 from west to east and one from east to west), all 1-3km south. In the early hours of 23 December, the same camera recorded three projectiles in flight from east to west, all 1-3km south. On the evening and night of 23-24 December, the camera recorded 12 undetermined explosions 2-4km south-east. It also recorded five undetermined explosions and a projectile in flight from west to east on the evening of 24 December and three projectiles from east to west in the early evening of 25 December, all 1-3km south.

During the day on 23 December, positioned at the railway station in “DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata (16km north-east of Donetsk) for about three hours, the SMM heard 20 bursts and shots of small-arms fire 2-3km west. The same day, positioned on the south-western edge of Yasynuvata, the SMM heard about 50 bursts and shots of small-arms fire 1-3km west.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, the SMM camera at the entry-exit checkpoint in government-controlled Maiorsk (45km north-east of Donetsk) recorded two projectiles in flight from north to south, followed by 25 projectiles from south to north, all 2-4km south-east. In the early hours of 23 December, the same camera recorded, in sequence, an undetermined explosion, three projectiles in flight from east to west and two undetermined explosions, all 2-4km south-east. On the evening and night of 23-24 December, the camera recorded four undetermined explosions 2-4km south-east.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, while in government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk), the SMM heard three undetermined explosions 5-7km south-west and about 40 undetermined explosions and over 240 bursts and shots of heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire, all 3-5km south-east. The SMM heard in the early hours of 23 December 31 undetermined explosions 3-5km south-east; during the day, 14 undetermined explosions and ten bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 5-8km and 47 undetermined explosions and 65 bursts of small-arms fire, all 3-8km south-east; and in the evening, two undetermined explosions 5-6km south-east.

In Luhansk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 December, the SMM recorded a similar number of ceasefire violations, but more explosions (six) compared with the previous reporting period (no explosions). Almost all ceasefire violations were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded no ceasefire violations; between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, the SMM recorded an explosion and a shot of small-arms fire.

During the day on 23 December, positioned 1km north-west of “LPR”-controlled Depreradivka (65km west of Luhansk), the SMM heard five undetermined explosions and six bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 5-7km north-west.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the south-western edge of “LPR”-controlled Molodizhne (63km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an undetermined explosion at least 5km south-west.

On 23 December, a “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Oleksandrivka (20km south-west of Donetsk) told the SMM that a senior “DPR” member had issued an “order” to all “DPR”‑members of the armed formations to comply with the recommitment to the ceasefire and not to return fire. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the Joint Centre for Control and Co‑operation (JCCC) in Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk) told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire and that Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the area had also been informed. On 24 December, an armed “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Pikuzy (formerly Kominternove, 23km north of Mariupol) told the SMM that “DPR” members in the area were aware of the recommitment to cease fire. In government-controlled Lebedynske (16km north-east of Mariupol), an officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire.

The SMM followed up on media reports of a civilian casualty. On 23 December, a Ukrainian Armed Forces soldier told the SMM that a man (71 years old) had triggered a booby trap while off the paved surface north of a checkpoint near Berezove (31km south-west of Donetsk) on 21 December. A volunteer paramedic, who said he had been working nearby at the time of the incident, told the SMM that the man had gone into the vegetation off the road when he tripped the booby trap, which had left his chest and left leg penetrated by metal fragments. Medical staff at the hospital in government-controlled Volnovakha (53km south of Donetsk), where the man was taken, showed the SMM X-rays which, according to the staff, showed approximately 15-20 fragments embedded in the man’s left leg, hip, and chest.

The SMM observed damage to civilian properties in residential areas. On 23 December, approximately 250m south-east of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street in government-controlled Pavlopil (26km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed a fresh crater, assessed as caused by an artillery shell (122mm) fired from an east-north-easterly direction. The SMM observed power lines cut about 75m south of the crater and saw a piece of shrapnel consistent with an artillery shell lodged in the outer pane of a south-facing window of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street. A resident of the house told the SMM that she had heard a loud explosion south-east of her home shortly after 22:00 on 22 December and immediately thereafter lost power. A resident of another house on the same street also told the SMM that he had lost power to his house shortly after hearing a loud explosion just after 22:00 on 22 December.

At 55 Karla Marksa Street in Yasynuvata, the SMM saw a fresh crater 3m south of the property’s entrance gate. The SMM saw fresh shrapnel marks on the gate, fence and south-facing wall of the house and assessed the impact as caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. The owner of the property (man in his seventies) told the SMM that the impact that caused the crater had occurred at 21:45 on 20 December.

At 51 Karla Marksa Street, the SMM saw two fresh craters 3m south and 7m north of a house, as well as four south-facing windows shattered and the south-facing walls scarred by shrapnel. The north-facing wall of the house was destroyed. The SMM assessed the wall to have been destroyed by the blast wave of the impact north of the house. The SMM assessed the impact to have been caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. One of the house’s residents (man in his seventies) told the SMM that shelling had started at around 22:00 on 20 December and that he, his wife and two minor grandchildren had been inside the house at the time.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 21 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded a projectile in flight from south to north (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area).

On the evening of 22 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded an explosion assessed as an impact of an artillery round about 4km east (assessed as outside the disengagement area). On the morning of 23 December, positioned on the eastern edge of “LPR”-controlled Pervomaisk (58km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an explosion and saw smoke rising assessed as the detonation of unexploded ordnance (UXO) 500-700m south-west and outside the disengagement area.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge (15km north-east of Luhansk), the SMM heard a shot of small-arms fire 500m north-west, assessed as inside the disengagement area.

During the day on 23 December, positioned near the Stanytsia Luhanska and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 24 December, positioned near all three disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 25 December, positioned near the Zolote and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in a government-controlled area, the SMM observed four multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) (BM-21 Grad, 122mm) near Poltavka (54km north-west of Donetsk) on 23 December.

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, the SMM observed a tank (type unknown) loaded on a flatbed truck in Rubizhne (84km north-west of Luhansk) and a surface-to-air missile system (9K33 Osa) in the outskirts of Klynove (68km north-east of Donetsk) on 25 December.

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw noted ten MLRS (BM-21) were missing for the first time 23 December; it also saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm), five towed mortars (2B9 Vasilek, 82mm) (three for the first time) and seven towed howitzers (2A36 Giatsint-B, 152mm) (all seven for the first time) on 24 December. In non-government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1) and noted a mortar (2B11 Sani, 120mm) and 12 towed mortars (PM-38, 120mm) were again missing.

The SMM revisited a permanent storage site in an area outside government control in Donetsk region, whose location was beyond the respective withdrawal lines, and noted that eight tanks (three T-64 and five T-72) were again missing. The SMM was denied access to another permanent storage site in a “DPR”-controlled area as its gates were locked and no one was present to open them.*

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles (ACV) and anti-aircraft guns[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, the SMM saw five infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (BMP-1) near Popasna (69km west of Luhansk) on 22 December; nine IFVs (BMP-1), an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) mounted to a military-type truck, an ACV (type unknown) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM‑1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna, as well as an APC (BTR-70) and an armoured reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk) on 23 December; ten IFVs (BMP-variants), four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (BRM‑1K), a self-propelled anti-aircraft system (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 23mm) and an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23) near Popasna, as well as a combat engineering vehicle (IMR-2) near Bezhynove (45km north-west of Luhansk) on 24 December; and seven IFVs (BMP-variants) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM 1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna on 25 December.

In non-government-controlled areas, the SMM observed an APC (BTR-70) near Petrivske on 24 December.

The SMM continued to observe the presence of mine hazard signs. At a checkpoint at the southern end of “DPR”-controlled Sakhanka (24km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed that two mines signs had been placed on a concrete barrier which had the message “No Passage” written on it in Russian. Although the concrete barrier was on the road, the SMM observed traffic driving around it. In front of the Ukrainian Armed Forces compound northwest of government-controlled Nadezhdynka (61km west of Donetsk), the SMM saw a 30x50cm rectangular wooden sign with a white background and black painted letters with “Danger Mines” written on it in Ukrainian.

The SMM visited five border areas not under government control. On 23 December, during about 40 minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Verkhnoharasymivka (57km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM saw 14 pedestrians exiting Ukraine and six pedestrians entering. On 23 December, during about 30 minutes at the pedestrian border crossing point near Novoborovytsi (79km south of Luhansk), the SMM observed a pedestrian entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about one hour at a border crossing point near Dovzhanske (84km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM observed 20 cars, four buses and nine pedestrians exiting Ukraine, as well as 20 civilian cars (three with “LPR” plates), a bus, a covered cargo truck and 11 pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about 45 minutes at a border crossing point near Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed a covered cargo truck and five cars (two with “DPR” plates) exiting Ukraine, as well as 19 cars (eight with “DPR” plates), two covered cargo trucks with “DPR” plates and two pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about ten minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Ulianivske (61km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed no pedestrians entering or exiting Ukraine.

In Kyiv, the SMM monitored gatherings in the city centre. On 24 December, between 12:00 and 14:00, the SMM saw up to 1,500 people (men and women, mixed ages) gathered at Independence Square. The gathering was held following a call on social media by an ATO veteran critical of the ongoing protest near the Parliament building. (See SMM Daily Report 19 December 2017.) The SMM saw no more than ten police officers near the square. The SMM also saw three other groups of people chanting slogans critical of the Government, including a group of about 25 men (aged 50-60) among the abovementioned crowd and another group of about 20 men (aged 20-40) near the square, and a third group of 25 people (mostly men, aged 20-60) in Shevchenko Park. The Mission saw the third group had marched from the park to Khreshchatyk Street. All gatherings ended without incidents.

2393129,"Colombia War-Crime Prisoners Face Past, Plan Future *In a Bogotá military prison, former soldiers encounter conflict resolution as they seek to rebuild lives.*

Tuesday, December 26, 2017 / BY: Aubrey Cox; Maria Antonia Montes  
PUBLICATION TYPE: In the Field  

The prisoners would be arriving soon and Adriana Combita, like a young teacher preparing to greet a new class, was nervous. This was not the first time that Combita, 26, had led a peacebuilding training with soldiers convicted of war-related crimes. But these were senior officers, commanders with master’s degrees, military officials who had lived abroad.

As they entered the classroom on the Puente Aranda military base in central Bogotá, some of the prisoners displayed a wary tension. Others slid into their seats and leaned back, looking relaxed. The 16 men made small talk while scanning the room to see who had shown up. Four of them still wore military fatigues. The rest were dressed in civilian clothing, a sign that the military or national police had severed them from service because of the severity of their crimes. Combita reviewed her agenda and taped diagrams on a white board.

The majority of the prisoners didn’t know what to expect, but they did know why they volunteered to be here: Before long, they will be given the option to tell their stories to a tribunal of magistrates established under the peace [accords](https://www.usip.org/blog/2017/09/colombia-peace-year-life-new-accord-farc) that ended 52 years of war between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC.) This classroom is a place to learn how to tell it.

The tribunal, which could recommend reduced sentences for the prisoners in exchange for the complete truth, forms part of an innovative transitional justice system known as the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP). Its mandate is to investigate and document serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the armed conflict, and to prosecute, judge and sanction the perpetrators of those crimes. The JEP is also responsible for presenting Colombian society with the truth of what happened in the conflict and addressing the rights of victims.  

Its aim is to help reweave Colombia’s social fabric.

**Generation Change**

Using knowledge and skills derived from the U.S. Institute of Peace’s [Generation Change Fellows Program](https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/06/colombian-youth-bolster-peace-accord-new-skills)(GCFP), Combita will help the men reflect on their lives and on how their actions in Colombia’s war affected others. They will learn new strategies to communicate and to engage with people from different backgrounds and experiences through channels other than violence.

Combita, whose direct but caring manner sets up an easy rapport with the prisoners, is a youth leader working on prison projects for the Internal Action Foundation. Before her Generation Change experience, she worked mostly with women prisoners, helping them develop entrepreneurship skills that might allow them to earn a living when they’re released. After participating in a training for Generation Change Fellows in March, Combita met a group of women leading trainings for imprisoned fighters from the FARC and a smaller insurgent group, the National Liberation Army. Inspired by those women, and her Generation Change experience, she decided to change her focus to conflict resolution and peacebuilding.

At the military facilities, she is helping to improve the prisoners’ ability to speak about their experiences in the war and to contribute to the JEP’s goals of truth, justice and reparation—in effect, preparing them for the JEP process. The military has given the program welcome access to its prisons.

This first session of the October 23 training lasts well beyond its scheduled two hours. In one structured exercise, Combita asks the men to reflect on the positive and negative aspects of their lives. For 10 minutes they silently draw “rivers” of their lives with positive and negative shorelines.

Many of the men, who range in age from 18 to the mid-50s, discuss their careers as a positive. Negatives include the armed conflict, the death of family members caused by it and their imprisonment. Most talk about “Dios supremo”—God supreme—as an ally throughout their journey and their families as providing stability throughout their sentences. They say the peace process that ended the conflict and the approval of the JEP are positives that they hope will allow them to tell their truth and feel some sense of release.

In other exercises, they talk about the incidents, people and places that shaped the trajectory of their lives and reflect on the experiences that landed them in prison. The objective is, in part, to [connect](https://www.usip.org/programs/mediation-colombia) to other people in a new, more human way.

“I know that what we’re doing and talking about today will help me in the future,” said one of the ex-soldiers. “I would have liked to have this type of training when I first arrived in prison. It could have helped me understand my colleagues, to help ourselves be better, understand myself and how I got here.”

**FARC and Soldiers**

Combita has already held 16 sessions applying GCFP’s lessons on prejudice awareness and reduction, conflict management and leadership development in prisons for women, [guerrillas](https://www.usip.org/publications/2016/11/gender-and-role-women-colombias-peace-process) and soldiers and police in Cartagena, Cali, and two other facilities in Bogotá.

Combita developed the prison engagements to help prepare the inmates for the JEP, considered by many the backbone of the peace accords and a critical component of the larger Integrated System of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition. Its success will largely depend on the engagement of civil society actors like her.

The JEP will handle the cases of people who participated directly in the armed conflict including military and security personnel and the FARC, though indirect participants may also appear before the JEP voluntarily. In exchange for verifiable full disclosure of all critical facts and complete cooperation with investigations, those accepting responsibility for human rights violations can benefit from reduced and alternative sentences, which may include community service. As of November, more than 1,700 members of the armed forces had applied to go through the JEP, and 3,491 FARC had inscribed as well.

Efforts to establish the JEP have progressed slowly in the first year since the accord with the FARC despite significant resistance from Colombia’s political opposition.

**Human Rights Experience**

In September, following an exhaustive review process, a selection committee picked 38 judges to lead the judicial mechanism.

Two months later, after Congress added hotly contested amendments to the JEP law including one barring magistrates with human rights experience from participating, a statute detailing the specific mandate and functioning of the program was approved. If it passes muster with the Constitutional Court early next year, the Peace Tribunals may finally become operational as early as the second half of 2018.

In the meantime, Combita and her allies press ahead because the prison engagements are critical to restoring relationships between civil society and the sector and moving Colombia closer to a [durable peace](https://www.usip.org/publications/2016/06/qa-colombia-cease-fire-accord-marks-historic-turn).

“Sometimes as men, we have a hard time reflecting on the past, and being okay with crying and letting go, and allowing ourselves to know each other better and grow closer, despite our circumstances,” said one of the prisoners as the session wrapped up. “What we’re doing here is beautiful.”",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"

Hours after the signing of the humanitarian cessation of hostilities in Addis Ababa on Thursday 21 December, the SPLA-IO led by Riek Machar and the government forces traded claims of attacks on their respective positions across the country.

On Monday, the SPLA spokesperson Brig Gen Lulu Ruai Koang issued a statement accusing the rebels of carrying out attacks on the government forces in five states: Yei River, Northern Liech, Amadi, Awiel East and Fashoda, in the last 24 to 72 hours.

""The rebels had stepped up offensive operations against SPLA’s positions in futile attempts to capture new strategic areas before IGAD peace monitors could embark on field visits,"" said Koang.

Also, he accused the rebels of disseminating "" negative propaganda"" in a bid to mislead the public opinion and present themselves as victims of attacks by the government forces.

Therefore, ""SPLA calls upon IGAD to immediately send investigation committee and peace monitors to investigate the latest violations as well as establish and verify who has been in control of all locations recently attacked by the rebels,"" said the army spokesperson.

Further, he called on the Ceasefire Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM) to send monitors to Kansuk, Lokbere and Koch, three areas where the army says the rebels attacked their positions.

""SPLA reiterates its commitment to Cessation of Hostilities Agreement but reserves the inalienable right to fight in self-defence when attacked,"" he emphasized.

2392024,"Sudan’s NLJP calls on African mediation to resume Darfur peace talks December 25, 2017 (KHARTOUM) - The National Liberation and Justice Party (NLJP) led by Tijani al-Sissi on Sunday has called on the African mediation to resume Darfur peace talks.

The former rebel Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM), formed by 19 rebel factions, signed the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) on 14 July 2011 with its leader Sissi became the chairman of the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA).

In December 2014, internal LJM differences surfaced, when Bahar Idris Abu Garda, LJM Secretary-General, publicly accused Sissi of mismanagement.

Sissi then formed the NLJP while Abu Garda established a new political party, the Liberation and Justice Party. The two parties participated in the 2015 general elections and the internal National Dialogue and they are now part of the National Consensus Government.

In statements to the semi-official Sudan Media Center (SMC) on Monday, the NLJP spokesperson Ahmed Fadl called to take advantage of all initiatives to achieve peace in Darfur, stressing their continued contacts with the rebel movements.

He said the seriousness of the rebel movements to achieve peace wouldn’t be tested until a comprehensive peace process be launched, stressing peace is a strategic choice for all Darfur movements.

The African Union High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) in coordination with the Darfur Joint Chief Mediator (JCM) mediate a two-track process in order to achieve a holistic peace in Darfur, South Korodfan and Blue Nile states and pave the way for constitutional reforms.

Talks between the government and two armed groups in Darfur, Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Sudan Liberation Movement-Minni Minnawi (SLM-MM), over a humanitarian cessation of hostilities, are deadlocked since August 2016.

Darfur holdout groups refuse the DDPD saying they want to discuss security and protection of civilians, compensations, land ownership, and justice. They point that the Doha document omitted to address these issues in the right way.

However, Khartoum says the DDPD is now part of the constitution, and it cannot be changed. They say the armed groups have to sign it and renegotiate what they want to improve it.

Darfur has been a flashpoint for lawlessness and violence since rebel movements took up arms against the Khartoum government in 2003.

UN agencies estimate that over 300,000 people were killed in Darfur conflict since 2003, and over 2.5 million were displaced.

2391544,"Soaring together to lead stabilization – A glimpse from Abu Kershola, South Kordofan “We had no communication and interaction with the locals. We did not have friends and could not trust each other” says Yagoub Ali, an IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) member in Abu Kershola. In a similar tone, El Nour Ahmed, a farmer in Abu Kershola, expresses “As a farmer, I faced frequent clashes with nomads whose cattle come to my farm grazing and destroy my crops regularly. I resorted to violence to show my power to the nomads and to convince them that I am able to protect my farm.  I was so angry that even when I was called several times by a committee of mediators to sit and negotiate to resolve this dispute, I refused.”

But things are changing for better in Abu Kershola, following a series of training on peacebuilding and conflict management, organization of peace forums & community dialogues, productivity in integrated farms, which are ran by the local Community Management Committees (CMCs) as well as the availability of water for drinking and irrigation from water yards. UNDP’s Community Security and Stabilization Programme (C2SP) brought this change, by establishing and training the CMCs, which also managed the water yards, among others.

Sharing his experience of working with CMCs, Yagoub Ali says “The CMCs facilitated interactions between us and people of Abu Kershola, they created work for us in the integrated farms; that helped us build bridge of trust with them. We now have a source of income as well as trustful relationship with brothers and sisters of Abu Kershola.” Farmer El Nour says “After I received training through the peacebuilding workshops and engaged in community dialogues organized by the CMC, I opted for peaceful negotiation with nomads because I realized that this cycle of violence is endless and there is nothing more important than to live our lives in peace.”

Abu Kershola locality, South Kordofan has suffered years of protracted conflict. Due to its proximity to Nuba mountains, the locality has witnessed regular attacks and intensive confrontations between warring parties’ troops resulting in large scale displacement of its Nuba population from Tagali group alongside groups of Arab and Fellata origin. As a direct consequence of the continued violence, traditional reconciliatory mechanisms were no longer working properly. In addition, mounting effects of climate change in the region had exacerbated the situation leading to deeper tensions between tribes in the locality.

UNDP’s innovative response to this crisis through the C2SP project was to establish CMCs comprising representatives of different ethnic groups, occupations and age groups and build its capacity in multiple sectors to address and prevent the impact of conflict. The handing over of power to people from various tribes living in the community while establishing ownership of the process and roles were crucial to lessen tensions over scarce land and water resources amongst existing communities as well as to alleviate pressure with arrival of new inhabitants.

This CMC model approach in the C2SP project, marks UNDP’s firm commitment towards stability, conflict prevention, and peace-building in the region.  UNDP works towards increasing the resilience of communities that are affected by conflict or are at higher risk of being drawn into conflict.  Placing vulnerable communities at the core who are likely to be drawn into larger conflict in the southern states of Sudan, C2SP supports the creation of alternative livelihoods opportunities; provision of socioeconomic infrastructure; capacitates communities on peacebuilding; and opportunities of reconciliation and social cohesion, anchored in the locally-owned CMC.  

The CMC members are made up of men, women and youth from different backgrounds representing diverse segments of selected target communities who work together in all aspects of the programme component thus enhancing tolerance between different tribes in the region. Apart from Abu Kershola, C2SP has targeted 6 other communities in South Kordofan - Debaibat, Abu Jubaiyah, Abassiya, Tilo, Hay Almark and Rashad. Since 2015, out of 93 targeted communities, this project has helped realize and create stability, resilience and social cohesion in 21 communities in six different states of Sudan.

C2SP supported the vulnerable communities in Abu Kershola locality through local NGO Sibro, and funding support from the Government of United Kingdom. In November 2017, DFID and UNDP, visited Abu Kershola to assess project progress and discuss challenges and how to better support community security, conflict prevention and development in the region. This was an important mission for people in Abu Kershola as it was the first visit by members of the international community in the last seven years.

During the visit, Abu Kershola CMC members expressed that they learnt new and different ways of mediation, problem solution, and dialogue from the C2SP peacebuilding training. They also collaborated with state peacebuilding mechanism who provided consultations and technical expertise and jointly organized planning and monitoring visits. They reported that, seven cases of conflict were successfully mediated during the course of C2SP intervention.

Thanks to funding from the United Kingdom government and their knowledge, C2SP continues to support stability, conflict prevention and development in the state focusing on unemployed youth with conflict carrying capacities, at-risk women, refugees, returnees and IDPs.

C2SP efforts have provided immediate results, as shared by CMCs during the visit: The CMCs prevented reoccurence of seven cases of conflict: three different inter-tribal conflicts and four farmers – pastoralists conflicts between 2016 and mid-2017. These conflicts did not escalate because of early interventions by CMCs. Each single time, the grievances were heard and resolved, with stability ensued. Ghada Elnour, an active female member of the CMC proudly expressed “Being a member of the CMC has given me a voice. This is so important to me and other women here. In the past, we were never part of the customary mediation process, but this situation is gradually changing. Due to the training in conflict resolution which we are receiving and the membership in the CMC, I am now proudly assisting in resolving emerging differences between groups and helping to prevent increase of tensions.” Youth representative of the CMC, Abaker Adam Belo added supportively, “Before C2SP intervention, there was little interaction amongst us – the young people in Abu Kershola, we used to meet only during the market day. However, we now come together and interact weekly through peace forums, in peace day celebrations, engage in the integrated farms, and community dialogue. This has helped us work collectively to consolidate unity in the community.”

However, for longer term peace in the region, more efforts need to be made on coordinated initiatives, like the CMC members. As DFID Sudan Conflict Advisor Ben Fisher who visited Abu Kershola notes in his blog “One significant obstacle however hinders the rebuilding of peace in South Kordofan. Access to big parts of the farming areas and pasture lands is restricted by mines and unexploded devices. This seriously limits the land use, both by pastoralists and farmers. Efforts are being made to coordinate with UN Mine Action to make the area safe from unexploded explosive ordinances (UXOs).” In the meantime, Abu Kershola inhabitants rise together through the C2SP supported CMCs to ensure that stability prevails in their area.

“I know you (SPLA) have always acted in self-defence but you now have to demonstrate the strength of an indomitable people, the sense of acting within the constitution and your duties to guard the constitution and protect lives and properties. The ceasefire agreement has been reached and the government is a signatory. You know to respect it and I want to start complying immediately. The division commanders have to get clear instructions about this,” said President Kiir.

The parties to the 2015 peace agreement converged this week in the Ethiopia capital to participate in the launch of the revitalization forum of the deal.

Kiir said the army has the right to fight back in self-defence and in pursuit of constitutional duties and functions if an attack by any of the forces identified in the ceasefire agreement.

His order comes 24 hours after a decision by the SPLM-IO leader Riek Machar who directed his troops to observe the humanitarian cessation of hostilities at midnight on Sunday 24, 2017.

2391434,"Libyan activists design a peace campaign Women and men activists from Libyan civil society organizations met in Tunis from 12 to 15 December to continuing the process of preparing a campaign aimed at fostering the culture of peace, reconciliation and peaceful co-existence in Libya. The idea of the campaign came as a result of two conferences, the first held in late 2015 to develop the Libyan women peace agenda and the second held early 2017 to develop an action plan to implement the agenda. In the training, the participants learned about conflict analysis tools and why it is important to include women in the peace process for the global peace and security. They also learnt lobby and advocacy skills to present the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (UNSCR 1325)   to Libyan people over the course of the campaign.

During the workshop, organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), the seven designated focal points for Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, Obari, Sebha, Albaida and Zawia, and their team members gained a better understanding of the UNSCR 1325 and became well versed on the best ways of communicating about it.

“I am now better prepared to start the campaign in my hometown. This workshop has allowed me to develop my presentation and communication skills. It has also deepened my understanding of the objectives and means of implementing the UNSCR 1325”, said Ms. Leila Bousif from Benghazi, President of Aoun organization for Human Rights.

The participants also discussed the role of women in peaceful coexistence since the campaign, called “Peace Libya,” intends to raise women awareness of the principles of peace and community cohesion.

“Libyan women are not very active in achieving peace, but they always leaning towards it. There won’t be stability in Libya without women`s participation. Although they are paying a high price because of the war, they must play a more active and positive role to end it,” added Ms. Bousif.

“Peace Libya” campaign will be launched next year with this core message: “promotion of peaceful coexistence is the responsibility of every Libyan citizen.”

“Knowing how to transmit the messages of the campaign to local communities is a very important mater. Libya is a diverse country. At the end of the training, I felt happy because I learned new skills to communicate with people from diverse cultural background,” said Rabha Farcy.

During the training, some participants pointed out that exposing women to the UNSCR 1325 can encourage many of them to play a more active role in peace building in Libya.

“As part of the Peace Libya campaign and based on the skills I have gained in this training, I will try to explain the UNSCR 1325 to as many women as possible when I head back to Libya. Participation in the peacebuilding process is not exclusive to men. Women should also make their voices heard,” said Ms. Asia Shwihdi from Misrata.

The training was organized as part of the project ‘Advancing Libyan Women’s Participation During the Transition.’ Known as AMEL project, it aims to strengthen the role of Libyan women in the political transition.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"

- On 6 December, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres said following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that, “Jerusalem  is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides”.

- For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which has further undermined an already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 2017 in the context of disputes between the de-facto authorities in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely impacted the availability of essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and has undermined Gaza’s fragile economy, especially the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. In the already impoverished Gaza Strip, residents have learned to adapt to the fact that electricity is only available for between two and four hours a day. The shortages have defined how people live their lives: getting up in the middle of the night if there is power to run washing machines or turn on water pumps. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory, electricity blackouts in Gaza last between 19-21 hours each day. Families in Gaza are forced to spend a large part of their income on energy, whether on the meagre supply of electricity they receive through high voltage lines, or on the cost of fuel, generators and their repair.

- A ceremony to mark the International Day of Human Rights was organized by the UNRWA Field Education Programme at Beach Preparatory Girls School A in Beach camp, western Gaza city, on 11 December. The Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, and other senior UNRWA staff as well as teachers, students and their parents attended the event. The event included activities such as songs, sketches and a drawing competition for the students. The parents also participated in an activity where they shared their views on gender equality and non-discrimination in the Gaza Strip, wishing for a better future for all. For over ten years UNRWA has been integrating human rights, conflict resolution and tolerance in its school activities. In May 2012, the Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA. This policy builds upon past successes, but also draws from international best practices and paves the way to better integrate human rights education in all our schools.

- An online lecture with the Japanese Research Syowa Station in Antarctica was conducted via Skype to a group of 30 students from two UNRWA schools on 11 December 2017. Dr. Hirofumi Oe, the station’s medical doctor, introduced the life in Antarctica and the mission of the research station to the students. The lecture lasted for two hours and included a presentation with photos and videos followed by an open discussion during which the students raised a number of questions such as the impact of climate change on the world, and Antarctica in particular. Commenting on the lecture, Dr. Hirofumi expressed his pleasure in speaking with UNRWA students in Gaza, explaining the environment of Antarctica, and the purpose and activities of the Japanese research mission there. The lecture was a great opportunity to widen both the knowledge and horizon of students in Gaza. Freedom of movement outside Gaza is virtually non-existent due to the blockade; 90 per cent of the over 271,900 students from UNRWA schools have never left the Gaza Strip in their lives. The UNRWA Education Programme recognizes the critical need for students to understand and connect with the world, and hence always seeks to implement innovative projects through which refugee students can link to, and share knowledge and ideas with, their peers and others in the rest of the world.

- UNRWA in Gaza celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 4 December 2017. The ceremony took place at the UNRWA Gaza Field Office compound and was attended by UNRWA Director of Operations, Mr. Matthias Schmale, Chief of the Field Relief and Social Services Programme, Mr. Asem Abu Shawish, UNRWA senior staff as well as heads of community rehabilitation centres that provide support to persons with disabilities across the Gaza Strip. The ceremony included speeches by Mr. Schmale, representatives from the coordination committee of the community rehabilitation centres, and a representative of persons with disabilities. It also included many uplifting performances by children with disabilities. The disability sub-programme of the UNRWA Relief and Social Services Programme provides various forms of support to people with disabilities and assists vulnerable groups of Palestine refugees through community social interventions. It conducts activities through 19 Community-Based Organizations, 7 Women’s Programme Centres, 7 Community-Based Rehabilitation Centres for persons with disabilities and 5 Youth Activity Centres.

- During the reporting period, as part of his regular outreach visits, the Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, visited Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, and Gaza City. During the visit to Khan Younis camp, the Director met with a beneficiary family receiving Social Safety Net support due to their extreme poverty and visited UNRWA Abu Teama Preparatory Co-ed school. In his visit to Gaza city, Mr. Schmale met with members of the School Parliament and their teachers at the UNRWA Gaza Preparatory Girls A, and then proceeded to Tuffah Distribution Centre, a Community-Based Rehabilitation Centre and the Sheikh Radwan Health Centre. The visit was followed by a meeting with UNRWA Health Programme senior staff in which the Chief of the Field Health Programme, Dr. Ghada Al-Jadba, highlighted the programme’s achievements and challenges in 2017.

On 7, 8, 9, 14 and 18 December, Israeli Forces fired missiles targeting militant training locations across the Gaza Strip in response to mortar shells fired by militants. Two deaths and 16 injuries were reported.

**UNRWA’S RESPONSE**

**THE UNRWA JOB CREATION PROGRAMME: PROVIDING A SOURCE OF INCOME AND STRENGTHENING SELF-RELIANCE**

The blockade of Gaza entered its 11th year in June 2017. The heavy restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza , in addition to the three consecutive conflicts and the internal political divide, have not only crushed the enclave’s formerly trade-based economy, they are also heavily responsible for the sky-rocketing unemployment rates. Extreme poverty, food insecurity and confinement contribute to depression, and hopelessness. According to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in Gaza was at 46.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.Even more dramatically, 71 per cent of females in Gaza are reportedly unemployed.
Through the UNRWA Job Creation Programme (JCP), the Agency works to mitigate the impact of the collapsed economy and labour market in Gaza by providing livelihood opportunities for Palestine refugees.

41-year-old Palestine refugee Enshirah Al-Batah, who lives with her nine-member family in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza Strip, received a three-month work opportunity as a labourer in an agriculture project in Beit Lahia as part of UNRWA’s JCP activities.

“I applied for a position in the UNRWA Job Creation Programme seven years ago. I felt blessed and happy when UNRWA called to inform me that I got a three-month job opportunity. Every morning I go to work with my colleagues and start my work with hope and passion. We pick and package strawberries and prepare them for possible export,” Enshirah said.

The programme targets both skilled and unskilled workers as well as professionals. Priority is given to applicants from households who have been assessed as living below the poverty line of less than US$ 3.87 per person per day; other criteria are gender, age, skills, or location. UNRWA aims to provide 40 per cent of skilled opportunities to women and 40 per cent of all job opportunities to youth. UNRWA also offers thousands of opportunities for graduates from Gaza universities through its Graduate Training Programme.

“This is my first paid job ever. Due to my family’s difficult economic conditions, I received little education. I can hardly read and write so it’s not easy to find a job. At the beginning, it was hard to adapt with the new routine, but now I can’t wait until morning comes to see my friends. I feel more confident and productive,” Enshirah added.

The Job Creation Programme provides not only a source of income, but also helps to restore self-respect, dignity and some form of self-reliance to thousands of Palestine refugees. The money earned through short-term job opportunities is mostly spent to cover basic needs such as medicine, fresh food, or clothes.

“I use the money I gain to repay my family debts and pay for my daughter’s college tuition. My dreams and hopes are simple. I dream of having a stable source of income,” Enshirah added.

In the first nine months of 2017, UNRWA created job opportunities for 16,515 beneficiaries, injecting US$ 12.4 million into the Gaza economy. To address high levels of youth unemployment in Gaza, a sub-component of the JCP – the Graduate Training Programme – offered 2,799 (out of the total of 16,515 jobs) opportunities to recent graduates in 2017 to date.

**FUNDING NEEDS**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget in 2017. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

Following the 2014 conflict, US$ 316 million has been pledged in support of UNRWA’s emergency shelter programme, for which an estimated US$ 720 million is required. This leaves a current shortfall of US$ 404 million. UNRWA urgently appeals to donors to generously contribute to its emergency shelter programme to provide displaced Palestine refugees in Gaza with rental subsidies or cash assistance to undertake reconstruction of their demolished homes.

As presented in UNRWA’s occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) Emergency Appeal for 2017, the Agency is seeking US$ 402 million to meet the minimum humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees in the oPt. The Gaza portion of the Emergency Appeal amounts to US$ 355 million for 2017, to address protracted, large scale humanitarian needs. More information can be found [here](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/emergency-appeals/opt-emergency-appeal-2017).

**CROSSINGS**

Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have undermined the living conditions of 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, Erez crossing and Kerem Shalom crossing. Rafah crossing is controlled by the Egyptian authorities and technically allows for the movement of a number of authorized travelers, Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases only. Erez crossing is controlled by Israeli authorities and technically allows for the movement of aid workers and limited numbers of authorized travelers, including Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases. Kerem Shalom crossing, also controlled by Israeli authorities, technically allows for the movement of authorized goods only.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2391249,"Strengthening farmer organizations as agents of peace in Colombia A new project of ICCO Cooperation in Colombia has been approved for signing by the European Union’s Trust Fund. In the project, farmer organizations will be strengthened as central agents in the construction of peace.

The project will be carried out in the framework of the implementation of the peace accord, signed in November of 2016 between the Colombian government and the FARC. One of the proposals in this accord is to improve the economic conditions in the country and dignify the living conditions of the rural population, which are fundamental steps towards achieving a peace. This project will contribute to that.

**Target groups**

The project aims at benefiting 2,500 people (youths, women, producers and ethnic and farmer communities), 12 producer and farmer organizations and 12 businesses in the agricultural sector.

A specific target group are smallholders, as improving the living conditions of the rural populations is an important step in the peace process. Furthermore, business initiatives of youths will be supported in the sectors of tourism, gastronomy and hospitality. The project will also promote the participation of women, indigenous and peasant communities in the formulation of the Plans for Development, led by the national government of Colombia.

**Agribusiness Booster**

Together with [AgriBusiness Booster](https://www.icco-cooperation.org/en/Expertise/Agribusiness-Booster), ICCO will co-entrepreneur in the project with small and medium-sized businesses which will be linked to the agricultural chain. Therefore an investment fund will be created for agro-productive initiatives. At the end of the project, the fund will be sustained by ICCO and Agribusiness Booster.

**Consortium**

The project will be implemented by a consortium led by ICCO with the participation of Agribusiness Booster, CETEC, PAX, JUSTAPAZ, Renacer, UNIPA and the National Platform of Rural Women, in alliance with the ministries of agriculture and local governments.

2391234,"Census workshops build unity in communities emerging from conflict “Nothing would be better than seeing many groups in communities come together and discuss for the common good” says U Yee Thant, a Senior Officer, Department of Immigration, Hpa-An District.

In the past, in places like Hpa-An in Myanmar’s Kayin State that are emerging from prolonged conflict, there was rarely an atmosphere that allowed for face to face interaction between local communities and government representatives. But a remarkable coexistence between previous adversaries emerges during the township workshop, facilitated by UNFPA, to discuss the local results from the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census. U Yee Thant readily concedes that it was not easy to convince people and organizations to show up at a workshop, let alone share their opinions and questions. Yet, the census dissemination workshops held in Hlaingbwe, Myawaddy and Hpa-An townships have enabled and empowered both individuals and groups to discuss the census results and their implications for local priorities and planning.

The 2014 census was the first to be conducted in over 30 years. The results provide vital data for socio-economic planning, resource allocation, projection and decision-making across the country. Census dissemination workshops have been taking place in townships throughout the country to promote data utilization in local communities, supporting the participants to develop a better understanding of census data for their day-to-day activities.

**A platform for peacebuilding**

In Hpa-An as in other conflict-affected townships, the workshop dialogue is not just a discussion about policy and development, it also forms an additional platform for the ongoing reconciliation, civic engagement and peacebuilding. The workshops unfolded a place where everyone is included, and where everyone can work together despite divergent needs and interests.

During the workshops, government agencies, ethnic armed organizations, civil society organizations, youth groups and individuals worked on pragmatic issues of interest to all, such as education, employment, living conditions and healthcare. The census data provides a baseline for setting shared and consolidated goals for the township’s development, including peaceful coexistence.

**Developing a blueprint for youth development**

The data is very useful for approaching youth policy and planning. Now I understand how to use the data as a reference. By knowing the facts about our youth population, their education levels and their job situation here at the boundaries of Myanmar, we can develop a blueprint for youth development in our own community”, says Saw Sein Htwe from the Nyein Foundation, which is a peace building non-profit organization in Hpa-An.

“Before, many groups have shown little interest in coming together. But the census dissemination workshop attracted groups from all parts of our society. People even asked for more such workshops to be held in the future, and I hope that we can do something similar again”, says U Yee Thant.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2391119,"South Sudanese Refugees React Warily to Signing of Cease-fire *Jason Patinkin* 

ABA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — 
In the Meri refugee camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 30,000 South Sudanese refugees yearn to return to their homeland, which has been ripped apart by a four-year civil war.

The new cease-fire signed Thursday between the government of President Salva Kiir and different rebel groups should raise hopes of peace in the war-torn country.

But the refugees in Meri camp who spoke to VOA said they are not celebrating just yet.

""We hear, but we don't know whether it is going to be,"" said Rose Tabu, a 20-year-old mother of one who came to Congo last year to escape fighting. ""We just leave it in God, since last time we hear 'peace peace peace,' but there is not peace.""

The cease-fire stipulates the two sides must stop military activities, allow access for aid groups, and uphold the laws of war, including not committing atrocities against civilians.

Lilias Arie, 24, urged the warring parties to stop targeting civilians. She said government soldiers had attacked civilians, while the rebel group led by former vice president Riek Machar, called the SPLA-IO, had stolen property.

""Since the fighting is between the IO and the government soldiers, why are they killing civilians, harassing civilians, even burning houses, why?"" Arie said. ""Let them not kill civilians. Salva should tell his soldiers to not kill civilians. And Riek should come to the table to find a solution to this war.""

Lino Lasuba, 32, said he did not have high hopes because many previous cease-fires have fallen apart.

""Of course, this is not the first signing of peace in South Sudan, several peace [deals] have been signed, so at the end of the day, what we expected changed to be the contrary,"" Lasuba said.

As the cease-fire goes into effect Sunday, South Sudanese refugees in Congo will be watching closely to see if peace will hold — and whether they can finally return home.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2391094,"UNAMI Underlines an Urgent Need for De-escalation Following Violent Demonstrations in Sulaimaniya [EN/AR/KU] Sulaimaniya, 23 December 2017 – Senior representatives from the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) emphasised in meetings held in Sulaimaniya on 21-22 December with government officials, political party leaders and civil society representatives, the urgency of de-escalating ongoing local tensions in the aftermath of demonstrations that had turned violent and led to arrests, injury and, regrettably, loss of life. 

The delegation called on a variety of leaders across the political and social spectrum. They included the deputy Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, H.E. Mr. Qubad Talabani; Governor of Sulaimaniya, Dr. Haval Abubakir; Provincial Council Chairman Mr. Azad Hama Ameen; leaders of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the Gorran Change Movement, Kurdistan Islamic Union (KIU), Kurdistan Islamic Group (KIG), Coalition for Democracy and Justice and the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in Suleimaniya; as well as activists, civil society organisations and citizens directly affected by the crisis. 

The purpose of the meetings was to underline the deep concern of the United Nations over the violence that accompanied demonstrations in the past few days, including the shooting of demonstrators and the torching of political party offices and public buildings in areas of the Sulaimaniya Governorate. 

The delegation reaffirmed the fundamental right of people to engage in peaceful demonstrations, in keeping with the law. They underlined the importance of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) handling protests in a restrained manner, in keeping with established modern police techniques, so as to avoid further escalation. The mission’s representatives highlighted the authorities’ responsibility to protect their citizens, including peaceful protestors, and safeguard their human rights; they urged the security forces to ensure the safety and dignity of demonstrators. 

The UNAMI team also made it clear that protestors themselves were responsible for ensuring that their voices were heard in accordance with the confines of the law, and did not resort to violence against the security forces nor engage in the destruction of public and private properties. 

UNAMI recognises that amongst the grievances raised by the protestors, the issue of security of citizens’ livelihoods in the face of the ongoing budgetary crisis is paramount. The UNAMI representatives reiterated the readiness of the Mission, in the event of a request from both parties, to use its good offices to support negotiations between the federal government in Baghdad and the KRG, working within the framework of the Iraqi constitution and focusing on all pending issues, including but not limited to the allocations in the federal budget, the payment of salaries and border controls, in response to the needs of all Iraq’s citizens in the aftermath of the hard-won victory over ISIL. 

The delegation inquired about the detention of demonstrators by the authorities, and specifically about the treatment of Shaswar Abdulwahid, leader of the New Generation Movement, and Rabun Maaruf, member of the Kurdistan Regional Parliament. UNAMI calls upon the authorities to conduct a transparent and fair process to address the activities of all those involved in the use of violence or the incitement thereof, within the confines of the law.

The SMM saw a crater in the yard about 15m south of the house and about 5m east of a shed which had sustained shrapnel damage to its east-facing side and to an east-facing window. The SMM assessed the damage as caused by an artillery round (of a calibre of at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. A woman (aged 40-50) told the SMM that she was the granddaughter of the owner of the house, an 81-year-old woman, who had sustained shrapnel injuries at around 22:00 on 20 December and had been admitted to a hospital in Yasynuvata. (See SMM Daily Report 22 December 2017.)

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 21 December, while on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard a burst of heavy-machine-gun fire and three shots of small-arms fire 2km south (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

During the day on 22 December, positioned in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske for about one hour, the SMM heard eight bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire and ten shots of small-arms fire 1-4km south (assessed as outside the disengagement area), six bursts of small-arms fire 1-2km south (assessed as inside the disengagement area) and an undetermined explosion 4-5km south-south-east (assessed as outside the disengagement area). On the same day, the SMM also heard and saw an undetermined explosion 500-700m south (assessed as outside the disengagement area) and heard two undetermined explosions 1-3km north-west (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

Positioned 2km east of government-controlled Bohdanivka (41km south-west of Donetsk), west of the Petrivske disengagement area, the SMM heard two undetermined explosions, five bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire and three shots of infantry fighting vehicle (BMP-2) cannon (30mm) fire, all 2-5km south-south-east (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

During the day on 22 December, positioned near the Stanytsia Luhanska and Zolote disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in a government-controlled area, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted, on 21 December, eight self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm) on the western edge of Oleksandropil (43km north of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted, on 21 December, 16 towed howitzers (D-20, 152mm) in Novoolenivka (48km north-west of Donetsk), eight tanks (T-64) in Zelene Pole (40km north-west of Donetsk) and seven tanks (T-72) near Kalynove (31km north-west of Donetsk). In non-government-controlled areas, aerial imagery revealed, on 22 December, the presence of 31 tanks (T-64 or T-72) near Kruhlyk (31km south-west of Luhansk), 26 howitzers (17 towed howitzers (D-30 Lyagushka, 122mm) and nine self-propelled howitzers (2S3 Akatsiya, 152mm)), eight mortars (2B11 Sani, 120mm) and 25 tanks (T-64 or T-72) near Myrne (28km south-west of Luhansk).

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In a government-controlled area, beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw four anti-tank guns (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm) for the first time.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles[2] in the security zone. In a government-controlled area, the SMM saw a reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) in Buhas (44km south-west of Donetsk).

The SMM observed demining activities. The SMM saw eight armed “DPR” members with demining prodders and detectors on both sides of a road about 5km north of “DPR”-controlled Petrivske.

The SMM observed long queues at the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge. On 22 December, positioned near an “LPR” checkpoint on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, the SMM saw about 1,000 people queuing to exit government-controlled areas and about 2,000 in the opposite direction. 

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Chernivtsi and Kyiv.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2391069,"Fezzan representatives adopt a charter for reconciliation Tunis, 22 December 2017 - More than 55 representatives from the South of Libya concluded a three-days Forum in Tunis by adopting a general Charter for Reconciliation. The participants included elders and wisemen from various tribal components of the South, community leaders, members of municipal councils, youth and women activists, local mediators, and civil society organizations.

The South Reconciliation Forum offered a platform for the various social components in the South to discuss the main challenges to peace in Fezzan, and to agree on a set of principles and mechanisms for local and national reconciliation. Participants stressed the pivotal position of Fezzan in the Libyan political and social landscape, in the hope that it will become a future symbol for reconciliation. They acknowledged, however, that initiatives to end the tribal wars in the Fezzan over the past six years have failed to build a solid peace. 

The South Reconciliation Forum therefore contributed to launching an inclusive dialogue leading to the elaboration of a Reconciliation Charter between the main stakeholders of the region. The signatory parties to the South Reconciliation Charter will seek to build wider support for it and encourage a greater number of constituencies to abide to it.

The Charter can be accessible here:

2391064,"UNHCR welcomes agreement to revive South Sudan’s stalled peace process UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, welcomes the recent agreement by the South Sudan government and opposition groups to revive the stalled peace process, and calls for the inclusion of refugees in shaping the destiny of the country.

The agreement was signed on December 21 between the rival parties of the conflict in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia during the High-Level Revitalization Forum. It aims to revitalize the 2015 peace agreement, cease hostilities, ease humanitarian access, ensure civilian protection and introduce sanctions on those violating the accord.

‘‘The latest initiative comes as a ray of hope for South Sudanese who have witnessed the ravages of war since 2013,’’ said Arnauld Akodjenou, UNHCR Special Envoy for the South Sudan situation.

Akodjenou said he hoped South Sudan will achieve peace and that parties will not dash the hopes of millions who have endured suffering for far too long.

‘‘We are calling for unreserved support to translate this agreement on paper into silencing the guns throughout South Sudan,’’ he added.

UNHCR is particularly heartened that the agreement upholds the rights of the South Sudan refugees and those displaced inside the country with references to assure the civilian character of settlements - urging the parties to actively pursue solutions on their behalf. 

The Agreement is expected to breathe a new life into a fraught peace process and will renew aspirations for peace among the four million people driven from their homes in the world’s youngest nation - including 2 million refugees hosted in six neighbouring asylum countries who have witnessed several peace initiatives come to pass without results.

2391024,"UNAMI Training Ends with a Call to Strengthen the Capacities of Women to Participate Meaningfully in National Reconciliation and Historic Settlement Process [EN/AR] Baghdad, Iraq, 22 December 2017 – An advanced training to enhance the negotiation and mediation skills of local civil society groups and women leaders, organized by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and UN Women, concluded in Baghdad on 20 December with calls for increased participation of women and civil society groups in community reconciliation, national reconciliation and historic settlement. The training was a follow-up to the basic training and workshop delivered to the same participants in October 2016. The workshop aimed at training women leaders to be effective mediators and facilitators. It also focused on the important role women can play in peace building, negotiations and political processes. Similar training and workshops have been delivered to 60 women leaders, human rights defenders, members of provincial, district and sub districts councils in the Southern Governorates of Missan, Karbala, Najaf, Basra, Wasit and Babil.

Women leaders at the workshop emphasized their readiness to UNAMI/UNWOMEN to advocate for their full participation and to offer them opportunities to participate in negotiations and reconciliation alongside their male counterparts. They agreed to form networks within their communities to address post Daesh issues like trust building among affected communities, de-radicalization of violent extremism as well as reconciling communities. They urged the UN to support their efforts towards rebuilding broken communities in the aftermath of the conflict with Daesh. They also urged the UN to strengthen women’s participation in the negotiations and political arena which was limited for women.

Speaking at the closing session of the four-day training, Ms. Mmabatlharo Nono Dihemo, Gender Advisor for UNAMI stressed the importance of strengthening the capacities of women to participate meaningfully in national reconciliation and historic settlement. Ms. Dihemo said: “Limited progress has been made towards increasing women representation in negotiation and mediation processes in Iraq. One of the reasons attributed to this is the belief by some that women lack the confidence and capacity to participate in such processes aimed at shaping the future of the country”.

However, Iraqi women are resilient, and have shown that they are capable of leading and influencing the political arena. Ms Dihemo said that “despite the explicit goal to promote women’s participation, as envisaged in the Iraq National Action Plan (INAP), women’s direct political participation in national reconciliation has continued to remain low and this needs to be recognized and addressed”.

She mentioned that she met with political leaders in Baghdad, Erbil and Suleymania and discussed ways to strengthen the participation of women in decision making and political processes. Ms Dihemo assured that UNAMI and UNWOMEN will work with all stakeholders to ensure the establishment of measures and legal frameworks that guarantee the participation of women in all three arms of the government, particularly the judiciary where women are underrepresented; and in national and community reconciliation processes; cabinet and government institutions.

2390659,"Secretary General, at Joint Event in The Hague, Stresses Need for Harder Work to Prevent Crises amid Growing Instability, Volatility SG/SM/18836  

22 DECEMBER 2017

Following are UN Secretary‑General António Guterres’ remarks at a joint event with Cabinet Ministers, academia and civil society of the Netherlands, “Security Central: The United Nations and Current Threats to International Peace and Security”, in The Hague today:

I am delighted to be visiting the Netherlands because it is always a pleasure to visit a country whose Government and people are such strong supporters of the United Nations and so clearly committed to multilateralism in the difficult times that multilateralism is facing in the present world.

The Hague is one of the world’s great centres of international life, including through hosting the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and several other organizations. And I would like to thank you again for your role in enabling the Tribunal to register many landmark achievements in justice, accountability and our fight against impunity for grave crimes.

This visit takes place just days before the Netherlands takes on important responsibilities as a member of the Security Council for 2018 — your first such term on the Council since 1999‑2000. So, I welcome the opportunity to review some of the challenges we face, counting on your very strong commitment to the work of the United Nations.

I know that the Netherlands wants to be effective as a partner in protecting people and maintaining international peace and security. You are also already a generous provider of humanitarian assistance, and an active participant in United Nations peacekeeping operations, with more than 300 troops and other personnel currently stationed in Mali, Liberia, South Sudan and the Middle East.

And you are a strong believer in gender equality and the empowerment of women and young people. And gender parity is today a central objective of the United Nations, being fully aware that we will never reach gender equality if we don’t make a strong bet on women’s empowerment. And parity in international organizations is a key tool for women’s empowerment. And you are deeply engaged in development cooperation, including as a key voice in shaping the landmark 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

I welcome the Dutch SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] Charter, by which the Netherlands is mobilizing a network of cooperation in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. Partnerships among the public sector, private business and civil society will be crucial in achieving the Goals and keeping the Agenda’s core promise to leave no one behind. For these reasons and more, you are well placed to help strengthen peace operations, address the diverse drivers of conflict and serve as a bridge between countries and people in a moment in which we have a serious deficit of trust — trust between people and political establishments and international organizations, and trust amongst States, namely within the Security Council.

With tensions over nuclear weapons as high as they have been since the end of the cold war, the Netherlands will play a key role as Chair of the Sanctions Committee on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and through involvement in implementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran.

You will also work with your Council colleagues on a worrying number of pressing, complex and dangerous threats to international peace and security. They include:  

* questions of accountability and justice related to the use of chemical weapons in Syria;  

* the crisis in northern Mali and the challenges of mounting a G‑5 Sahel force in the region;  

* the risk of widespread famine in Yemen and the critical importance of ensuring humanitarian access to those in need;  

* and ensuring that the unique needs and roles of women and children affected by conflict are taken into account.  

We are all aware that this is a moment of profound uncertainty and risk unparalleled in the post‑cold war period. Beyond the nuclear question, other threats to international peace and security are evolving rapidly and are increasingly transnational and interlinked. Climate change is moving faster than we are. Water scarcity is a growing concern. And his Majesty the King has played a very important role in relation to mobilizing the international community on addressing the water problems.

Inequality is rising. Cybersecurity dangers are escalating, as some of the same advances in technology that have generated so many gains have also made it easier for extremists to communicate, broadcast distorted narratives of grievance, recruit followers and exploit people. The misuse of digital surveillance poses serious challenges to the free exercise of democratic rights and processes.

Civil wars almost tripled in the decade between 2005 and 2015, including a sixfold increase in fatalities between 2011 and 2015. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of armed conflict, resulting in massive humanitarian needs. Today’s conflicts are increasingly exacerbated by transnational factors such as drug smuggling and human trafficking, and provide a source of income for armed groups.

And we have also seen a rise in the internationalization and regionalization of conflicts, as in Syria, Libya and Yemen. When one looks today at the Middle East, we see a global Middle East crisis. It’s no longer only the Israel‑Palestinian question or the Syrian crisis or the Iraq crisis or the… all these things are interlinked. Both sides of the gulf in a very complex situation of conflict and a widespread threat moving from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, and in ways that are totally unpredictable in relation to the near future. We don’t know where the next crisis will emerge, how serious it will be and how we will be able to face it.

Europe itself is home to a number of unresolved protracted conflicts, and faces threats — such as violent extremism and human trafficking — linked to conflict dynamics beyond its borders. These developments are taking place within a polarized international community. Divisions in the Security Council and divergences with or within regional organizations constrain efforts at unified action. And we are also seeing a rise in nationalist, xenophobic and populist agendas, namely in the West. The integration of newcomers to the region remains a considerable challenge.

Like the United Nations, European institutions are facing a drop in trust and have struggled to create political consensus and adapt their collective security tools. So, we have our work cut out for us. It is clear to me that in face of greater instability and volatility, we must work harder to prevent the crises that take such a high toll on humanity, undermine institutions, and reverse development progress.

We must tackle the immediate grievances and root causes of conflict that divide societies and cause States and citizens to use violence and repression as a means of achieving their goals and resolving their differences. A prevention agenda may seem an ambitious project in a moment of global polarization and political flux. But fortunately, with the 2030 Agenda, we have a clear, credible and common road map in relation to development and many aspects that we can centre around development. Because the framework includes Goal 16, dedicated to “peace, justice and strong institutions”, governance is a central question in our concerns.

For my part, upon taking office I initiated a wide‑ranging reform process to streamline United Nations management, align the United Nations development system with the 2030 Agenda, and strengthen the United Nations peace and security architecture. The latter involves a strong focus on early warning and early action to avoid crises, and peacebuilding in order to sustain peace. And I have also established a High-level Advisory Board on Mediation as part of a broader and necessary surge in diplomacy for peace. And this is particularly worrying when the, I would say, most relevant brand of the United Nations — that are the “Blue Helmets” — the peacekeeping missions face such a challenging environment in many contexts where there is simply no peace to keep.

The question of the future of peace operations will now be submitted to a strategic review in which we hope the Netherlands will play a very important role. And we are extremely grateful for your continued commitment to peacekeeping, even in the very difficult situations where peacekeeping takes place. The presence of the Netherlands forces in Kidal [Mali] is the demonstration of that fact. This is something that must be at the centre of our discussions in the Security Council during the next year, and we count a lot on the Netherlands to help us do the necessary strategic reviews and reforms.

The magnitude and complexity of global challenges are too immense for any country or organization to tackle alone. We need to do more to devise joint strategies and to draw on our comparative advantages. The United Nations is strongly committed to deepening our partnership with key regional partners like the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. At the same time, and in relation to peace operations, our cooperation with the African Union is a key strategic objective that we are already fully implementing in the context of the enhanced platform of cooperation between the two organizations.

Together, we must spread a common message of tolerance and present an alternative vision to the xenophobic agendas that fuel conflict and the animosity in the region and around the world. Prevention is urgent. And I look forward to hearing your thoughts on how, together, we can spread the message and the practice of peace. I wish the Netherlands every success during the important year ahead, including during your Presidency of the Security Council in March. I believe this will be a very important moment for us to move ahead in some of the most difficult dossiers that we have been trying to tackle in the recent past.

2390609,"Tragedy spurs Cattle Keeper's Passion for Peace at Migration Conference in South Sudan **KHALIF FARAH**

Bashir Hamid is a cattle keeper from Misseriya, a nomadic community living in the border zone between Sudan and South Sudan.

In the dry season, the 56-year-old and his people migrate across the border into Dinka territory of South Sudan to graze and water their cattle. Historically, this has caused significant tension and, at times, violent clashes between the two communities.

Since 1991, Bashir Hamid has been involved with various initiatives to keep the peace between the groups.

Despite the loss of five sons aged between 18-27 years in fighting at the border early this year, his personal commitment to peace remains steadfast.

“As painful as the loss of my sons is, and despite the strong urge for revenge, I and my community remain committed to maintaining peace with our Dinka neighbours,” he said.

This year, Bashir Hamid attended the Misseriya-Dinka pre-migration conference in Wanyjok, Aweil East State, to contribute to peace-building efforts. The two-day conference was supported by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan’s Civil Affairs Section, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Saferworld, an independent international organization dedicated to improving security, peace and development.

More than 125 representatives from both communities gathered for the annual conference and  signed a  number of resolutions affecting pastoral migration and trade including security of cattle keepers, blood compensations, cattle theft, rape, adultery, farm destruction  and bush burning . The delegates also recommended removal of the multiple taxations, immigration fees and other barriers to improve cross border trade.

For Misseriya, Bashir Hamid says, living with Dinka in peace is not an option but a necessity.

“To get grazing and pasture for our cattle, which are our economic mainstay, during the dry season in South Sudan, we must maintain good neighborliness, relationship and cooperation with Dinka.”

He says the two communities are bound by common destiny, not only by geography, migration and trade. His vision for the future is a relationship transformed into one of cooperation between the two countries of Sudan and South Sudan, with free movement of people and good across the border.

Bashir Hamid is proud that his generation have made peace with Dinka possible. He hopes that the next generation will nurture that relationship and continue the legacy of peace into the future.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"

Apakan said the recommitment, which was made in Minsk on 20 December, should in the spirit of the season lead to comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, starting at 00:00 on 23 December. “There is an opportunity to end the violence and human suffering, allowing people to resume their normal everyday lives, especially over the holiday season,” he said.

“If underpinned by withdrawal of weapons and disengagement and made in good faith, this recommitment to the ceasefire holds the promise of a more peaceful new year for the people of eastern Ukraine,” said Apakan.

The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission will continue to monitor and verify compliance.

2390519,"Statement on behalf of the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, 22 December 2017 Special Envoy de Mistura attended today the Astana meeting, which was hosted very effectively by President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and organised under the auspices of the three guarantors of the 30 December 2016 ceasefire – the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Turkey. The Special Envoy reiterated his belief that maintaining and enhancing the deescalation of violence remains an essential contribution to the shaping of an environment conducive to a political progress in Syria as per Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). Through his presence and activity in Astana, the Special Envoy reaffirmed his keenness in this regard. 

Noting his concern over the lack of progress on urgent humanitarian issues despite the establishment of deescalation zones, with no access to besieged locations during the month of December, the Special Envoy called for unhindered humanitarian access throughout the country. In particular, he emphasised it was urgent for the United Nations to be able to deliver immediate life-saving assistance to all besieged locations, as well as undertake urgent medical evacuations from Eastern Ghouta. In his capacity as Special Envoy, and subject to endorsement by the United Nations headquarters, he also welcomes the fact that there has been some progress on important confidence-building measures, such as humanitarian demining. 

On the issue of detainees, abductees and missing persons, the Special Envoy has taken note of an agreement on a working group for the release of detainees and abductees and on the exchange of information on missing persons. He considers this is commendable as a first step towards reaching a comprehensive arrangement between the conflicting parties. The United Nations reiterates that real progress on the release of detainees, and the exchange of information about abductees and missing persons, consistent with resolution 2254 (2015), is crucial. This should be achieved through establishing the standing working group discussed in details in previous Astana meetings. The United Nations will continue to emphasise the need for meetings of this working group to happen on a systematic basis. 

Further to his meetings in Moscow yesterday with Russian Defence Minister Shoigu and Foreign Minister Lavrov, Special Envoy de Mistura had further exchanges with guarantors in Astana on the initiative to convene a congress of national dialogue in Sochi, planned to take place in January 2018. The United Nations maintains its view that any political initiative by international actors should be assessed by its ability to contribute to and support the mandated political process under the United Nations in Geneva and the full implementation of resolution 2254 (2015). The Special Envoy will be consulting the Secretary-General once he has received all the information required. 

In the meantime, the Special Envoy recalls his intention to convene a ninth round of intra-Syrian talks under the auspices of the United Nations in January, which he announced to the Security Council in his briefing of 19 December and discussed in Washington DC and Moscow earlier this week. The focus of this round will continue to be the full implementation of resolution 2254 (2015), with a specific focus on the constitutional and electoral baskets of the agenda while continuing to explore other baskets. He is looking forward to making substantive progress with the Syrian delegations in this context, as the round will be an important opportunity to assess the readiness and ability of the parties with the support of the international community to advance a political solution to the Syrian crisis under the aegis of the United Nations in Geneva, as called for by resolution 2254 (2015).

2390399,"Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of 19:30, 21 December 2017 This report is for the media and the general public.

The SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations in Donetsk region and more in Luhansk region compared with the previous reporting period. The Mission followed up on reports of civilian casualties from Yasynuvata. The SMM observed damage to civilian properties in residential areas in Novoluhanske, Dokuchaievsk and Yasynuvata. The Mission continued monitoring the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske; it recorded ceasefire violations near all three. Its access remained restricted in the disengagement areas and elsewhere, including at a checkpoint near Verkhnoshyrokivske and a compound in Luhansk city.* The Mission saw weapons in violation in Sievierodonetsk and near Novotroitske. It observed convoys of trucks marked, “Humanitarian Aid from the Russian Federation”, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The SMM visited four border areas outside of government control.

In Donetsk region, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations[1], including about 190 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 540 explosions).

On the evening and night of 20-21 December, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, four undetermined explosions, three projectiles in flight from east to west and two projectiles from west to east, followed by a total of 38 undetermined explosions, an illumination flare in vertical flight, 157 projectiles (107 from east to west, 45 from west to east and five from north-west to south-east) and 13 tracer rounds in flight from east to west, all 0.5-1.5km south. In the early evening of 21 December, the same camera recorded three undetermined explosions and 19 projectiles in flight from east to west, all 0.5-1.5km south.

At a morgue in “DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata (16km north-east of Donetsk), a medical staff member told the SMM that the body of a man (aged 50) had been brought to the morgue at about midnight on 21 December. She said that the man had died as a result of injuries sustained from shelling at his home (at 10 Kvartal 102 Street) in Yasynuvata, adding that shrapnel pieces had been extracted from his stomach. The SMM saw a shrapnel piece and that his name was recorded in a logbook.

At a hospital in Yasynuvata, medical staff told the SMM that a man (aged 67) had been admitted with shrapnel injuries to his right leg at 21:30 on 20 December. The man told the SMM that he had been at home (at 14 Kvartal 103) with his wife when he had heard explosions between 20:00 and 21:00 on 20 December; he added that a shrapnel piece had penetrated the window and hit his right leg. The SMM saw the man’s right leg fixed with bloody bandages.

The same medical staff told the SMM that on 20 December, two women (aged 80 and 56) had been admitted at 21:50 and at 23:25, respectively, and that the former (at 66 Karla Marksa Street) had shrapnel injuries to her legs and a concussion and the latter (at 11 Kvartal 102) with shrapnel injuries to her head, a fracture to her left shoulder and a concussion. The SMM saw them lying down in the hospital.

The SMM followed up on reports of damage to civilian properties in residential areas caused by shelling. The SMM visited impact sites in government-controlled Novoluhanske (53km north-east of Donetsk) (see SMM Daily Report 21 December 2017), “DPR”-controlled Dokuchaievsk (30km south-west of Donetsk) and Yasynuvata.

The SMM was unable to assess the direction of fire. On 19 December, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle UAV spotted damage to the roof of the kindergarten. (See SMM Daily Report 21 December 2017.)

At 2 Shkilna Street, the SMM saw two fresh craters in the courtyard of a school, as well as shrapnel damage to one of the courtyard walls, assessed as caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon. The SMM was unable to assess the direction of fire. On 19 December, the same UAV spotted damage to the roof of the school. (See SMM Daily Report 21 December 2017.)

At 25 Shkilna Street, the SMM saw shattered windows and shrapnel damage to the south-west-facing side of a medical facility.

A female worker (in her thirties) in the building told the SMM that shelling had occurred at around 13:00 on 19 December.

At 22/2 Sovetska Street on 21 December, the SMM saw a hole in the west-facing side of a two-storey house, assessed as caused by a round of a 30mm cannon fired from a westerly direction. The SMM also saw a destroyed storage building 10m south of the house. A female resident (in her sixties) told the SMM that she had been at home when she had heard an impact and saw smoke and dust emanating from the roof of the storage building at around 12:00 on 19 December.

In Yasynuvata, at 50 Zavodska Street, the SMM saw a fresh crater in the yard 3m north of a single-storey house, assessed as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon fired from a northerly direction. The SMM also saw shrapnel damage to the north-facing roof, side and gate of the house, as well as shrapnel damage to the ceiling and walls of a room in the northern side of the house. A resident (in his forties) of the house told the SMM that shelling had occurred between 20:30 and 20:50 on 20 December while he, his wife and a 12-year-old daughter had been at home. He said that they had laid on the floor and covered themselves with mattresses until shelling had ended.

At 11 Kvartal 102 Street, the SMM saw a fresh hole in the ceiling of a kitchen in apartment no. 73 on the top floor of a seven-storey residential building as well as shattered north-facing windows. In apartment no. 75 on the top floor of the same building, the SMM saw a fresh hole in the wall at the northern side of the kitchen and shattered north-facing windows through the hole. The SMM assessed that both cases of damage above had been caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon fired from a northerly direction.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 18 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded two tracer rounds in flight from south-east to north-west at unknown distances south-west (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area). On the evening of 19 December, the same camera recorded an undetermined explosion at an unknown distance north-north-west.

On the evening of 20 December, while on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard over 150 undetermined explosions 10km west.

In the early hours of 21 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded two bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 2-3km north-north-east, assessed as outside the disengagement area.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in government-controlled areas, the SMM saw 12 anti-tank guns (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm) near Sievierodonetsk (74km north-west of Luhansk). Aerial imagery on 10 December revealed a probable tank (either T-64 or T-72) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a government-controlled area, aerial imagery on 10 December revealed the presence of two surface-to-air missile systems (9K35 Strela-10 and 9K36) in Donske (57km south of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a non-government-controlled area, the SMM saw three stationary tanks (T-64) in firing positions near Myrne (28km south-west of Luhansk). (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw one surface-to-air missile system (9K31 Strela-1) and eight MLRS (9P138 Grad-1, 122mm), and noted that 15 MLRS (11 BM-21 and four 9P138), one self-propelled howitzer (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm), one surface-to-air missile system (9K35) and 21 anti-tank guns (18 MT-12 and three D-48, 85mm) continued to be absent.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles and an anti-aircraft gun[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, an SMM mini UAV spotted an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) near Chermalyk. Aerial imagery on 10 December revealed the presence of six infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (five BMP-2 and one BMP-1) near Novotroitske.

The SMM observed the removal of a mine at the northern entrance of government-controlled Hnutove (20km north-east of Mariupol). The SMM saw 15 Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel present, two of whom were handling an anti-tank mine (TM-62) and storing it in a tarpaulin bag near a checkpoint. One of them told the SMM that the State Emergency Services had removed the mine from a field earlier that day. The SMM saw a stationary vehicle with “State Emergency Services” written in Ukrainian on the side.

In both Donetsk and Luhansk regions the SMM observed convoys of trucks with “Humanitarian Aid from the Russian Federation” written in Russian on the side. At the south-eastern edge of “LPR”-controlled Luhansk city at 08:55 on 21 December, the SMM saw a convoy of 16 covered white cargo trucks (five with black Russian Federation military licence places and the remainder with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates) on road M04 heading north-west. The convoy was escorted by at least three cars (white in colour with two orange stripes on the sides) with blue flashing lights on, three white-and-blue cars, and an ambulance (some of them with Russian Federation licence plates and the remainder not seen). The SMM saw one of the trucks with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates leave the convoy and heading north-west. Later, the Mission observed the convoy enter a compound at 4A Darhomyzhskoho Street in the southern outskirts of Luhansk city. When the SMM attempted to enter the compound, two armed “LPR” members wearing clothes with “LPR” “police” written in Russian denied its access, claiming that the SMM would not be given access without permission from other “LPR” members.*

At 1 Baumana Street in “DPR”-controlled Donetsk city’s Budonivskyi district (6km south-east of city centre) at around 11:00 on 21 December, the SMM saw five covered white cargo trucks (one with black Russian Federation places and four with white Russian Federation licence plates) parked along the side of the street in front of a storage facility. In the compound, the SMM saw about 20 covered cargo trucks being unloaded. Later that day, at 14:15, the SMM saw a convoy of 28 covered cargo trucks (all with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates), escorted by three cars with black Russian Federation military licence places and a car with “police” written in Russian (with “DPR” plates), on T0507 heading east near “DPR”-controlled Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk).

The SMM visited four border areas outside government control. At the border crossing point near Uspenka, during two hours, the SMM saw 111 cars (39 with “DPR” plates), five vans (one with “DPR” plates), three buses, 81 covered cargo trucks (20 with “DPR” plates) exiting Ukraine, and 71 cars (34 with “DPR” plates), ten vans (four with “DPR” plates), 16 covered cargo trucks (six with “DPR” plates), two fuel trucks and two buses (one with “DPR” plates) entering Ukraine. A woman in her forties near the crossing point told the SMM that between 06:00 and 06:30 on 21 December she saw around 20-25 trucks enter Ukraine, being escorted by “police” cars heading west. A man in his forties told the SMM that he had seen a convoy of around 20 trucks in “DPR”-controlled Kuteinykove (42km south-east from Donetsk), about 35km west-north-west of Uspenka.

At the border crossing point near Marynivka (78km east of Donetsk), during one hour, the SMM saw 14 cars (one with “DPR” plates), two vans and six pedestrians (five men and one woman, aged 40-50) entering Ukraine, and 31 cars (seven with “DPR” plates), three vans (two with “DPR” plates) and four covered cargo trucks exiting Ukraine.

At the border crossing point near Izvaryne (52km south-east of Luhansk), during an hour, the SMM saw 15 cars (two with “LPR” plates), two buses, five covered cargo trucks and 160 pedestrians (94 women and 66 men, aged 35-60) exiting Ukraine, and 22 cars, three buses and 58 pedestrians (39 women and 19 men, aged 35-60) entering Ukraine.

At the border crossing point near Sievernyi (50km southeast of Luhansk), during about 25 minutes, the SMM saw 11 pedestrians (seven women and four men, aged 40-60) entering Ukraine, and two men in their forties exiting Ukraine.

2390234,"IOM Iraq Holds Community Policing Conference on Ninevwa Baghdad - IOM Iraq's Community Policing program in cooperation with Iraq's Ministry of Interior held a conference on 20 December 2017 on the promotion of cooperation between law enforcement agents and community members towards peace and security in Ninevah Governorate.

Neenwa was deeply affected by the recent conflict, with heavy damage to its infrastructure - especially in its capital Mosul - and intensive displacement, as more than 941,000 individuals continue to be displaced across the governorate.

IOM Iraq's Migration Management Unit has been focusing on the implementation of the project ""Strengthening Community Policing in Iraq"" in retaken areas of Ninevah and other conflict-affected areas since the project began in 2016.

The conference followed a series of activities in November and December that included the establishment of five new Community Policing Forums (CPFs) in Ninewa and training for more than 400 individuals, including police officers, community members and civil society representatives, on applying community policing in a context of post-conflict returns. 

The conference was preceded by a three-day workshop exploring the role of women in security dialogue. Over 80 women and men from across Iraq participated, including police, civil society representatives and the community members, to discuss the impact of gender-based violence on community security, the role of women in violent extremism and how women and children are involved with ISIL should be treated. Workshop participants formed working groups on these topics, and discussed how to implement action plans developed in the event.

The Community Policing conference on Ninewa was held in Baghdad and attended by government officials, notably Mr. Saad Maan, spokesman of the Ministry of Interior, the Head of Community Police Directorate Brigadier General Khalid Al Mhannah, NGO staff and CPFs representatives from Mosul, Fallujah and Baghdad.

Speakers included CPF members from Al-Amiriat Al-Fallujah and Mosul (Baasheka), police officers, community members and civil society organization representatives, who introduced the CP model and discussed the successes and challenges of the CPFs in Ninevwa. The conference cave the CPF members the opportunity to network and share experiences.

IOM Iraq Community Policing project is financed by the German Federal Foreign Office.

""The sharing of experiences, successes and challenges of Community Policing Forums in retaken areas will help us to tailor the next phase of implementation of this program and the follow up actions that will continue to strengthen this model, based on mutual trust and responsibility in Iraq ""Said IOM Iraq Chief of Mission Gerard Waite.

""I am very grateful for the cooperation between the Iraq and German governments in the Community Policing project,"" said Dr. Cyrill Nunn, German Ambassador to Iraq. ""We have high hopes that the success of the project can contribute to the much-needed reconciliation and stabilization in Iraq,"" added the German Ambassador, highlighting the valuable contribution of the CP model to the stabilization of the Iraqi social fabric.

CPFs are inclusive platforms that include police, local leadership, civil society organizations and members community, where citizens can raise their security concerns. CPFs identify and develop initiatives that lead to safer communities, protect the most vulnerable and enhance cooperation, transparency and mutual trust between these actors. The CP model encourages CPF members to analyze the available resources in their respective communities and to assess the ability of a wide range of actors to find solutions to situations that are potentially dangerous and harmful. As such, CPFs are tools for conflict prevention.

Brigadier General Saad Maan, spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, thanked the German Government, IOM and guests for their efforts in support of the CP model. ""We have been working very hard to put the Iraqi citizens first. There will be no sustainable security in the governors unless citizens are part of it, and that is exactly the foundation of this initiative, by implementing the CP model across the country, mainly in Ninewa. We have achieved great results in stabilizing the country thanks to the cooperation with our international partners, ""said Saad Maan.

A total of 66 CPFs have been established across Iraq; 42 established by IOM's CP project, and 24 independently established by local police and communities, building on the CPFs model.

2390104,"Carter Center Post-Election Statement: International Election Observation Mission to Nepal’s 2017 Provincial and Federal Elections, Dec. 21, 2017 **Carter Center Issues Statement on Nepal’s Counting Process**

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
Contact: In Atlanta, Soyia Ellison, soyia.ellison@cartercenter.org

KATHMANDU — The Carter Center today issued a post-election statement detailing its findings related to Nepal’s vote-counting process.

These findings remain preliminary, pending the announcement of election results and the resolution of any disputes. A final report that includes recommendations to help strengthen the conduct of future elections in Nepal will be published in early 2018.

During the counting, Carter Center observer teams were present in 27 districts throughout Nepal, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 districts. In its statement, The Carter Center noted that in the counting centers where observers had sufficient access, counting took place in a manner that was generally consistent with international standards, despite widespread deviations from established procedures. However, a considerable number of counting centers restricted Carter Center observers’ access, limiting the transparency of the process.

The decision to hold the elections in two phases meant that ballot boxes from Phase 1 needed to be stored for 10 days before being opened, creating the risk of ballot-tampering. But in Phase 1 districts where Carter Center observers were present, ballot boxes were safely secured and were under the close scrutiny of political party agents. Carter Center observers reported no incidents related to the storage of Phase 1 ballot boxes.

After Phase 1 polling, the Election Commission of Nepal issued directives outlining official counting instructions. These were widely ignored, however, as most returning officers chose instead to work with political party agents to reach consensus on vote-counting procedures. In counting centers where Carter Center observers were present, the deviations from the directives were intended to increase efficiency and avoid possible grievances and did not compromise the integrity of the count. While these local-level agreements ensured overall acceptance of the process and results, they also led to inconsistencies, particularly regarding the determination of the validity of ballots.

Party and candidate agents were consistently present in the counting centers and followed the process closely. Party agents did not make substantive complaints about the conduct of counting in the centers where Carter Center observers were present.

Sixteen of the 27 districts in which Carter Center observers were present provided full access to observers. The other 11 restricted access to varying degrees. Limiting observer access to this crucial aspect of the process is contrary to international standards, to the expressed intent of the ECN directives, and to the terms of observer accreditation. The presence of observers is integral to ensuring the transparency and integrity of an election, and provisions should always be in place to allow them adequate access.

2389469,"2017 was hugely successful but challenges still lurk, says AU Special Representative for Somalia Nairobi, 21 December 2017 – The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (SRCC) Ambassador Francisco Madeira has described 2017 as hugely successful year in the fight against the Al-Shabaab but cautioned that there were challenges facing the transition from the multinational force to Somali security forces.

The SRCC named the successful conclusion of the electoral process that saw a new Parliament and Senate, culminating in the election of a new president as some of the milestones achieved by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in 2017.

Addressing a media briefing in Nairobi this morning, Ambassador Madeira said some of the challenges AMISOM faces include the dearth in funding and uncoordinated training of Somali security forces by different partners.

“The reality is, AMISOM and Somali security forces face major challenges due to unpredictable funding. Without funding, little can happen to move forward with certain undertakings already made on the security front,” said the SRCC who is also the head of AMISOM.

He said in 2018 AMISOM will require funding to recover territory under the control of Al-Shabaab, to enhance the capacity of Somali security forces to take over from AMISOM troops, and to integrate the Somali National Army (SNA).

“Militarily, subject to logistical support, we are planning elaborate offensive operations mainly in the Jubba valley, Gedo region and Middle Jubba regions which still harbor pockets of Al-Shabaab militants,” the SRCC noted.

Ambassador Madeira said this was part of AMISOM’s exit strategy to ensure that it liberates the entire country and hands it to Somali security forces. He called for synchronized training of the Somali National Army to establish a strong force capable of defending the country once AMISOM exits.

“The training of the army must be synchronized and centred upon a common doctrine and ideology. Currently, there are too many stakeholders involved in the training of security forces, without a harmonized plan as indicated in the operational readiness assessment,” the SRCC observed.

He noted that AMISOM’s exit (drawdown) had already started with about 1000 soldiers set to go home by the end of this month and an equal number will depart next year in accordance with the United Nations and the African Union recommendation on a gradual and phased re-organization of the Mission.

Ambassador Madeira however lamented the lack of resources to support AMISOM troops in executing their mandate.

“In a nutshell, we need urgent support. Our troops are ready but they need to be resourced. This has not been happening to expectation despite repeated commitments by partners in different forums,” the head of AMISOM noted.

He added that the multinational force was building capacity of the Somalia security forces so that when they exit, terror groups do not take over the liberated territories.

“We are planning to hand over to a properly capacitated Somali National Army at least 10 Forward Operating Bases next year as part of the transition. Discussions are ongoing with the Federal Government on modalities of this hand over,” the SRCC said.

Ambassador Madeira mentioned three pillars necessary in strengthening Somalia’s national security, namely, sustainable security reform, inclusive and stable politics and economic recovery.

He warned that jihadists fleeing from Libya, Yemen, and Syria were changing the dynamics of Somalia war, making it imperative that the transition should be well managed.

The Mission, whose mandate ends on May 31 after 10 years restoring peace in this Horn of Africa nation, is gradually scaling down its military operations, in what is called “drawdown”. According to the UN Security Council Resolution 2372 (2017), the Federal Government of Somalia will progressively take over AMISOM’s responsibilities.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2389174,"World Vision Kenya: Hunger Response Situation Report No. 13 (1-30 November 2017) **KEY MESSAGES**

• Drought conditions remain critical: Due to drought, water stress is acute, milk production and livestock prices are well below normal, and livestock mortality is rising in the following counties: Garissa, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kilifi, Laisamis, Narok, Samburu (East),  Tana River, and Wajir (South and West).

• Other drought-affected areas are no longer in crisis: In some other Arid and Semi-arid lands (ASAL) areas, particularly in the northwest and in parts of the coast, conditions have returned to normal following significant off-season rainfall in recent months. However, in all ASAL counties, staple food prices remain well above normal, at a time when market dependence is high in the wake of successive poor seasons.

• Acute malnutrition: World Vision continues to respond to child malnutrition, with more than 420,000 children and nearly 37,000 pregnant and lactating women requiring treatment for acute malnutrition across the country.  Many areas continue to have Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates over the emergency threshold of 15 per cent.

• Presidential election: The country’s security situation has returned to normal after a volatile few months. Violence spiked in November in many informal settlements in Nairobi and Kisumu following the repeat presidential election held on the 26th October 2017, which was boycotted by the main opposition party.

• Access to health care services: After 150 days, the nurses’ national strike which begun in June was called off by the nurses’ union in November 2017. Nurses were ordered to resume their duties and restore health services across the country.  The strike negatively affected maternal and child health along with,  HIV and nutrition services.

• Scaling up response: In relation to the drought response interventions, the World Vision Kenya Flash Appeal has a funding gap of US $19.1M. Without additional funding,  World Vision Kenya will be unable to optimally support the drought emergency response, and mitigate the risks of a worsening situation for children.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2389134,"Statement by Sweden at the UN Security Council Debate on UNAMA (21 December 2017) National Statement delivered by Ambassador Irina Schoulgin Nyoni on behalf of Sweden at the United Nations Security Council Debate on Afghanistan (UNAMA), 21 December 2017, New York.

Mr President,

I would like to align myself with the statement to be made later on behalf of the European Union and its member states.

Let me begin by thanking Special Representative Yamamoto, Executive Director Fedotov, and Ambassador Umarov for their comprehensive briefings. Let me also thank, in particular, Ms Wazhma Frogh, for bringing the voices of Afghan women into the chamber today.

Mr President,

The report of the Secretary-General underlines the continuing instability and volatility that affects the lives of the Afghan people on a daily basis. At the same time, as Special Representative Yamamoto has pointed out today, opportunities do exist to break the cycle of violence that has afflicted the country for four decades.

Mr President, I would like to make three points today.

Firstly, only the Afghan people, working together, will determine the future for Afghanistan. An Afghan owned and Afghan led peace process remains essential. Therefore, we welcome the Afghan government's strong commitment to engage in a political process.

The upcoming meeting in the Kabul process will be an important step towards creating an environment conducive to peace. We strongly encourage UNAMA to actively support the efforts of the Afghan government to ensure that the Kabul meetings result in a sustainable peace process.

During her visit to Afghanistan in October, the Swedish Foreign Minister met with representatives from all parts of society, and underlined the importance of an inclusive peace process. Ensuring that the whole population, meaning both men and women, can participate effectively is vital for the achievement of a sustainable peace, as is the active participation of civil society.

The regional context is important as many of the challenges facing Afghanistan cannot be dealt with in isolation. We urge all stakeholders, especially Afghanistan's neighbours, to assume responsibility and to work together towards a political settlement. There is tremendous potential in increased regional cooperation and we welcome the engagement of the central Asian states in this regard.

It is imperative for Afghanistan's future stability that parliamentary elections take place in 2018 and presidential elections in 2019, as announced, and that the elections are conducted in an inclusive, credible and transparent manner. Every effort must now be made to ensure difficulties are overcome and that elections take place.

We welcome the Secretary-General's emphasis in his report on women's participation in elections. We urge the electoral management bodies and the Afghan government to take all necessary steps to ensure women's full participation in the elections, both as voters and as candidates.

Mr President,

Secondly, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is vital to the achievement of sustainable peace. We congratulate Afghanistan on its election to the Human Rights Council. As an elected member of the Council, we expect Afghanistan to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights. We deplore the recent executions of five prisoners and urge the government to reinstate the de-facto moratorium on the death penalty, with a view to abolishing this cruel and inhumane punishment.

We appreciate the efforts of UNAMA in the area of human rights, not least pertaining to its work on children and armed conflict and civilian casualties. We encourage them to continue this important work.

Attacks against humanitarian and development workers, health-care professionals, medical transports, hospitals and other medical facilities as well as schools, continue and are deeply concerning. Such attacks not only impede efforts to aid the people of Afghanistan, but infringe the enjoyment of the right to education, health and life which are crucial in building sustainable peace. In addition, civilians continue to bear the burden of the conflict, with women and children increasingly under threat. We are deeply concerned by the increased recruitment of children by armed groups, in particular the Taliban, and call for an end to this practice.

Finally, Mr President,

I would like to reiterate our strong support for the outcome of the strategic review of UNAMA and the Secretary-General's recommendations. It is now important that these recommendations are implemented without delay. With its unique field presence, UNAMA can continue to make a tangible difference on the ground and provide important support for efforts to attain a lasting peace.

An integrated United Nations approach linking together peace, development and human rights work in Afghanistan is crucial to delivering results. Our expectations from UNAMA in this regard are high.

Mr President,

Sweden's assistance to the people of Afghanistan has remained steadfast for over three decades. Afghanistan is Sweden's single largest development cooperation partner, and our support will continue, including for reform efforts aimed at building strong and independent institutions. The Afghan people can count on our continued backing as they advance their efforts to build a peaceful, stable and inclusive future.

Thank you

2389114,"UN human rights experts call for perpetrators of widespread human rights violations to be brought to justice in South Sudan JUBA/ADDIS ABABA (22 December 2017) – Four years following the start of the current conflict in South Sudan, gross human rights violations continue to be committed in a widespread way by all parties to the conflict, in which civilians are bearing the brunt, says the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan* at the conclusion of a 12-day visit to the region

""The Commission welcomes yesterday's announcement made at the High Level Revitalization Forum of the Inter-Governmental Authority (IGAD) of a cessation of hostilities agreement yet remains gravely concerned over the lack of accountability for serious crimes which is fuelling impunity throughout the country,"" stated Commission Chairperson Yasmin Sooka.  ""Those responsible for this war against civilians must be stopped with the perpetrators of these horrific acts brought to justice,"" she added. 

Over the course of the Commission's visit to South Sudan, eastern Ethiopia and northern Uganda (11-22 December) Ms. Sooka and fellow Commissioner Andrew Clapham met with numerous victims of the conflict who shared harrowing accounts of indiscriminate attacks, revenge killings, torture, abduction of women and children, forced displacement, looting and burning of homes and crops, starvation, rape and other forms of sexual violence. In a country where food insecurity is acute, crops are destroyed leaving villages starving.

""We are deeply disturbed by what we witnessed and heard throughout our visit.  The deprivation and range of sexual violence are hard to describe, people are targeted and suffering just for being who they are.  The atrocities and violations are no longer just confined to a few parts of South Sudan; they are happening all across South Sudan,"" Professor Clapham stated.

While in South Sudan the Commissioners travelled to Wau, Bor and Akobo and visited Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites in Juba and Wau where individuals and families have sought protection from the violence and are provided the essentials of daily life by non-governmental organizations and humanitarian agencies.   The Commissioners met with camp leaders, elders, and women's and youth representatives.

In Wau the Commission met with an 89 nine-year-old widow who described how her husband and two sons were shot in front of her and how she too begged for her life.  Several witnesses and victims described how they were forced to flee their villages as they watched their homes burned and family and friends killed before their eyes.  A 60-year old woman told the Commission how she was gang raped by several soldiers and left for dead.

Many of the women the Commission met spoke of how they were sexually abused when their homes were attacked, often when they were collecting firewood. The Commission also heard of young men who were gang raped, often in front of family members. The Commission was also told that young men have been forced to rape relatives in front of family members.  ""Those perpetrating these crimes seem to be intent on breaking all social norms resulting in societies being torn apart,"" Ms. Sooka stated.

In Akobo, the Commission met with a number of internally displaced people who explained in great detail how they fled recent fighting in the Jonglei region and their trek of some 160 kilometers to the border town with Ethiopia, where they were now struggling to survive by eating leaves from trees and where their children were not able to attend school as they had no money for the fees.

""As another Human Rights Day passes and the world's focus shifts to other matters people here feel forgotten and are really suffering horrific violations of their rights.  The scarcity of food in many parts of the country is worrying, while incidents of rape and killing continue. The situation is really tragic,"" stated Professor Clapham. 

Equally disturbing testimonies were shared with the Commissioners during their visits with refugees in Gambella, Ethiopia and northern Uganda.  Those the Commission met with included several visibly traumatized unaccompanied minors who described the horrors and overwhelming sense of insecurity that forced them to flee the world's newest nation state. 

""I saw of lot of killing. I felt very unsafe.  I came here to escape the violence and seek a better way of life,"" recalled a 17-year boy who had just arrived at the Elegu collection point on the South Sudan-Uganda border who lost both his parents to the conflict.  Another recently arrived refugee in Gambella refugee camp in Ethiopia stated: ""I love to go back to South Sudan because it is my home country but I chose to stay here because I still want to live. There, it is either I would die of war or of starvation."" 

Refugees told the Commission that nearly everyone in South Sudan has a weapon which is now used to settle disputes resulting in the level of killings rising. A young man in the Palabek refugee camp in northern Uganda, where some 40,000 South Sudanese refugees have now settled having fled the fighting in the Pajok region in April this year, equated the vast presence of arms to a ""silent killing"".

""Civilians in South Sudan have become a football between the warring parties causing them to flee.  They have lost everything.  All they want is to be able to send their children to school, tend to their crops, feed themselves and live in peace,"" Ms. Sooka declared. 

The Commission met with humanitarians who spoke of the heightened insecurity around their work including the restrictions on access to several parts of the country obstructing humanitarian aid to those who need it most. Attacks and abductions of aid workers continue. While in Juba, the Commission sat in on the Terrain Hotel trial hearing the case concerning the rape of foreign aid workers and killing of a South Sudanese journalist in July 2016.   

The Commissioners held meetings with various Government officials, United Nations staff, members of the diplomatic community, members of the National Dialogue for South Sudan, and the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Committee(JMEC), responsible for monitoring and overseeing the implementation of the August 2015 Peace Agreement

The Commission's visit overlapped with the IGAD-led peace talks in Addis Ababa aimed to reach a solution to the conflict which began on 15 December 2013. 

""Our Commission calls for the parties to respect the agreement on the cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and humanitarian access and work towards building sustainable peace,"" Sooka stated.  ""Sustainable peace is linked to ensuring that the provisions of Chapter Five of the Peace Agreement are implemented. The Hybrid Court and the Commission on Truth, Healing and Reconciliation must be established without further delay. Justice delayed is justice denied,"" she added.

""Even if peace does come, there will need to be a lot of reconciliation,"" stated a young man from Juba, now in Kiriyandongo refugee camp in Uganda.  ""We are desperate for peace.  Please advocate for our peace and our human rights,"" he added.

The Commission is due to report to the Human Rights Council with its detailed findings in March next year.

The 15-day training is aimed at preparing the officers to carry out joint patrols in Gaalkacyo as part of a ceasefire agreement, brokered with help of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), United Nations and other partners.

The Gaalkacyo Ceasefire Agreement was signed on 1 January 2017 by the Puntland and Galmudug State Presidents, after months of fighting between the two administrations over the control of Gaalkacyo. Under the agreement, patrol teams from both states would be trained to help enforce the cessation of hostilities between the two administrations.

Speaking during the closure of the training, this week, Galmudug Finance Minister, Sa’ed Seed, thanked the officers for their active participation, adding that the exercise was important for the restoration of peace and co-existence between residents of the two states.

His sentiments were supported by the Puntland Military Commander, Gen. Sa’ed Hersi, who commended the trainees for their courage and commitment to serve the country and urged them to be vigilant and disciplined as they embark on joint police patrols.

Gen. Hersi commended AMISOM Police, the United Nations and development partners for their support in facilitating the training and helping in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.

Also present at the function was the Regional Governor of Puntland, Ahmed Khalif, and his counterpart from Galmudug, Abdirashid Haji. Representatives from AMISOM, UN, traditional elders and members of the civil society also attended the ceremony.

The joint patrol teams are expected to provide security to the Joint Ceasefire Committee members, while on visits to the buffer zone established between Galmudug and Puntland. The officers will also support ongoing initiatives to restore stability and the rule of law, and also act as focal points for rebuilding confidence and peace in Gaalkacyo.

Today’s Agreement marks a critical first step in the efforts to end the senseless conflict and carnage that has been unfolding in South Sudan since December 2013. While welcoming this first step, the Chairperson of the Commission stresses that the true test of the genuineness of the parties’ professed commitments lies in the full and effective implementation of their pledge to end violence and uphold the most basic tenets of international humanitarian law.

The people of South Sudan, who have endured so much pain and suffering, are investing great expectation in the faithful implementation of this Agreement. They desperately need and deserve respite from war, especially as they enter this festive Christmas season, and look with rekindled hope towards the New Year.

The Chairperson of the Commission therefore urges the South Sudanese stakeholders to deliver on the commitments made. They should build on this important achievement and continue to make the necessary compromises without which the revitalization process cannot succeed.

The Chairperson of the Commission seizes this opportunity to reiterate the African Union appreciation to IGAD and the Heads of State and Government of the region, for their commitment and steadfastness. Their continued leadership is critical to take forward the peace process. The Chairperson also commends IGAD Special Envoy Ismail Wais, as well as former Foreign Ministers Georges Chicoti of Angola, Hanna Tetteh of Ghana and Ramtane Lamamra of Algeria, who served as Facilitators.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"

By Stefanie Glinski

GANYIEL, South Sudan, Dec 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Surrounded by swamps and accessible only by plane or boat, South Sudan's Ganyiel, a rebel-held town in a country torn apart by civil war, has been dubbed a ""haven of peace"" by its residents.

Impoverished and living with the constant threat of floods, Ganyiel's population of some 40,000 people nevertheless consider themselves lucky.

Several ethnic groups live together relatively peacefully - navigating the town's waterways in tree-carved boats.

The world's youngest nation, South Sudan gained independence in 2011, but descended into civil war four years ago when President Salva Kiir accused his deputy Riek Machar of trying to oust him.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people and created Africa's largest refugee crisis.

Fighting has raged along ethnic lines, between forces loyal to the mainly ethnic Dinka government and the opposition fighters, most of whom are ethnic Nuer.

But while the rest of the country is divided, Ganyiel, sheltered by marshes, which form natural defences in the centre of the country, has grown as an ethnically mixed town that could serve as a model for nurturing pockets of peace elsewhere.

""We're a peaceful island within South Sudan,"" said Ganyiel's town director, Michael Lot.

""Just two months ago, 2,700 Dinka arrived here, fleeing food insecurity and conflict. They are welcome. The war is political. It's not between us people.""

CHALLENGES

A third of South Sudan's 12 million population has fled their homes amid persistent reports of gang rape and ethnic violence.

Despite its well defended location, war remains a constant threat in Ganyiel and it is regularly hit by floods that destroy the harvest.

The town has depended on food distributions by the U.N.'s World Food Programme as long as residents can remember.

But in contrast to other areas, marriage and trade among different ethnic groups is common while five aid agencies have coordinated to provide basic education and healthcare.

Each evening, as the sun sets, the town's red dirt airstrip fills with people taking walks or playing football in the evening breeze.

The bucolic peace is sometimes frayed by disputes over cattle, land and water, which can escalate into feuds between clans.

And with a prevalence of guns even among civilians, killings and revenge killings are not uncommon, said a South Sudanese aid worker who asked not to be named.

FREE MOVEMENT

Mary Deng arrived in Ganyiel two months ago. She's a Dinka and her journey north took her several days.

""Our community was accused of intermarrying with Nuer people and we no longer felt safe,"" said the mother of three.

""We move freely in Ganyiel and interact with the community,"" she said, sitting on the ground outside her hut, holding her youngest son on her lap. ""Intermarriage has been common in this area for a long time.""

This is largely due to cattle trading, facilitated by the town's trade union that promotes livestock sales in the surrounding region and as far north as the Sudan border.

""Proximity to the River Nile has linked Ganyiel to Juba and the outer world, thus making it a hub for the entire region. Fish and livestock products are exported through the port to the capital and other markets,"" said Raphael Ndiku, a Ganyiel-based aid worker with German agency Welthungerhilfe.

Commodities and people have always moved in and out of the town, mixing its residents with outsiders.

""Trade was flourishing here before the war,"" said Kharbin Banybor, head of the Panyijiar County Trade Union.

""The trade and free movement led to a lot of intermarriages, even with Arabs from the north,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Adut Amal, a Dinka woman from the town of Yirol, about 60 km (40 miles) to the south, is the widow of a Nuer man. Sitting on a mattress in the shade, she is wrapped in a floral robe.

She has lost her eyesight and doesn't know her age, but still remembers the day she came to Ganyiel after her marriage.

""My husband was a trader who knew my family well. It was difficult to leave my home and move away, but the community welcomed me openly,"" she said, recalling her difficulties learning the Nuer language and the culture's songs and customs.

""I still sing Dinka songs, but I know that Ganyiel is my home,"" Amal said. ""The country is in crisis, but to me all people are the same.""

TRADE

Access to food has been a struggle in Ganyiel and the townspeople depend on food drops by plane.

The sparse selection of goods in the market are brought in from Juba by Nuer traders and are shipped up the Nile through government-held areas by their Dinka partners.

""It's increasingly difficult and the markets are almost empty now, but we try to keep our businesses going,"" said shopkeeper Kuany Thiong, standing by his stall selling flour, onions and yeast. There are few vegetables in the market – families live mainly on sorghum and beans.

Helicopters and small airplanes arrive on the dirt airstrip several times a week, bringing in aid workers and health personnel.

""They have figured out how to make it work, covering the town's basic needs,"" said Ian Ridley, head of South Sudan's United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

""The need is still great, even though Ganyiel enjoys relative peace and safety due to its geographic location.""

For Banybor, the trade union head, Ganyiel is a model town, even with widespread poverty and hunger. ""Both the humanitarian response and the interethnic relations work. A lot can be learned from it,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

So-called bottom-up grassroots peace initiatives need to be pursued as well as peace talks at the top level, said a Juba-based expert on conflict monitoring.

The December-to-May dry season usually intensifies clashes and there is little chance of peace talks to end the war, diplomats and analysts said last month.

""The war is all around us and it's dangerous,"" said Banybor. ""I'm happy that we get to feel safe in Ganyiel for now.""",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2388559,"Coping with trans-generational trauma: a key feature of peacebuilding work in Rwanda Within a 100-day span in the spring and summer of 1994 the Rwandan genocide claimed the lives of an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Tutsis and their sympathisers. A generation has since past yet Rwandans, old and young alike, are continuing to experience post-genocide trauma. Why is this the case and what can be done to counter this enduring trauma?

As with any society that has suffered horrible atrocities, post-genocide Rwanda has had to cope with an enduring trauma. This phenomenon has been observed not only among those that lived through the 1994 Rwandan genocide, but also among a second generation of Rwandans who continue to suffer from the societal trauma caused by this tragedy. This observation brings us to undoubtedly confirm that trauma, if not healed, can become a _transgenerational phenomenon_.

**Trans-generational trauma: an existing reality in Rwanda**

The transmission of trauma from one generation to another and its related consequences are gradually gauging the interest of peacebuilding organizations in Rwanda, key among them Community-Based Sociotherapy (CBS) which is currently working on this particular issue. CBS has explored the intergenerational legacies of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, investigating specifically how the genocide, its aftermath and related events are transmitted within families to future generations.

In its recent research project, entitled “Intergenerational Legacies of the Genocide in Rwanda and Community Based Sociotherapy: Identifying and Addressing Pathways of Transmission,” it was revealed that the legacies of the 1994 genocide and its aftermath have been transmitted to the second generation within families through direct and indirect pathways, which are interrelated and interact in multiple ways.

The direct pathways of inter-generational transmission concern the ways in which the genocide and related events are reflected upon, reconstructed and explicitly communicated - or not - to the second generation.

The indirect pathways of inter-generational transmission are the ways in which the genocide affects the second generation’s socio-cultural environment and, in turn, the child. One of the research project's key findings, as pointed out by CBS, is that the legacy of the genocide, including its transmission of trauma and violence across generations, is a risk factor for sustainable peace and development.

It is understandably true that those who were alive when the genocide happened have been suffering from traumatic experiences and troubling memories. For members of the second generation, i.e. those who were not yet born when the genocide happened and are direct descendants of those who witnessed the genocide, though they did not directly experience the physical and psychological pain of the genocide, they have been raised in a traumatised society and, in one way or another, have been affected by the multiple consequences of the tragedy.

Living in a post-genocide context, all Rwandans have suffered from leftover trauma: no one can claim to be immune from the society’s _‘generalised’_ suffering. The fact that even those who were born after the genocide can acquire the trauma from parents, relatives and neighbours, has put trauma-healing efforts on the list of priorities for ensuring sustainable peace and development in Rwanda. 

In order to respond to this issue and break the cycle of trauma and violence, a consortium on the issue was recently formed, which is composed of the following organizations: Community Based Sociotherapy Rwanda (CBS), Prison Fellowship Rwanda (PFR), Anglican Church in Rwanda/Byumba Diocese (EAR-D/B) and Duhumurizanye Iwacu Rwanda (DIR). Supported by Palladium Rwanda, the consortium is undertaking a pilot project called _Umusingi w’Amahoro Arambye_ (‘The Foundation for Sustainable Peace’ in the Kinyarwanda language).

The project aims at facilitating evidence-based grassroots advocacy and strengthening citizen’s participation in order to contribute to the recognition and prevention of inter-generational transmission of trauma and violence at the family and community levels. The project is being coordinated by Community Based Sociotherapy Rwanda and implemented by Prison Fellowship Rwanda and the Anglican Church, Byumba Diocese, in close cooperation with the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (NURC).

**Towards creating a conducive environment for effectively coping with trans-generational trauma in Rwanda**

To effectively address this inter-generational trauma and contribute to ensuring sustainable peace and reconciliation, it is of utmost importance that the issues that mark the lives of Rwandans at a grassroots level are known to policymakers and the voices of the community members are heard. In addition, practices at the community level that aim at reconciliation and development could be even more effective when they are informed about trauma.

CBS explains that a trauma-informed approach: (1) is aware of the impact of trauma on individuals and communities and understands potential pathways to recovery; (2) recognises the signs and symptoms of trauma; (3) responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies and practices; and (4) seeks to actively resist the re-traumatisation and transmission of trauma. A trauma-informed approach complies with some key principles, such as creating safety, trust and mutual support, rather than a prescribed set of practices or procedures.

To be able to contribute to this, the Umusingi w’Amahoro arambye project has proposed a ‘4A’s strategy’: awareness, advocacy, acknowledgement and action. Through the project, the consortium intends to: increase awareness on the necessity of investing in responding to the problem of inter-generational transmission of trauma; develop and implement appropriate mechanisms for grassroots advocacy; identify and acknowledge issues related to trans-generational trauma; and, take actions to inspire policy and practices with the aim of ensuring that the healing and reconciliation processes in Rwanda are sustainable.

Launched on Thursday 28 September 2017, at Marasa Umubano Hotel, the project is expected to start a policy dialogue between national and local government representatives and local civil society, leading to the integration of efforts to counter inter-generational trauma in national policies and practices on national unity and reconciliation, mental health, youth and socio-economic issues.

To effectively break through the cycle of intergenerational transmission of trauma and violence, there is a pressing need to promote initiatives like the Umusingi w’Amahoro Arambye project and expand them throughout the country.

Such initiatives should create a conducive environment and provide opportunities for generations to freely talk with one another, for elders and adults to frankly share the truth about the past, and for young people to openly ask questions about the history of their country and guarantee the rights of imagining and creating the future they want.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2388534,"Statement by the Spokesperson on the deterioration of the humanitarian and security situations in eastern Ukraine The humanitarian and security situations have deteriorated abruptly in eastern Ukraine, where we have seen the highest number of ceasefire violations since February 2017, the ensuing loss of life and the destruction of property. The positioning of armed forces in close proximity to residential areas and firing from or towards critical infrastructure shows complete disrespect for peoples' lives. Greater restraint and further efforts to protect water supplies and energy infrastructure is vital.

The ceasefire needs to be respected, military forces must disengage and withdraw heavy weapons to verifiable storage areas. We also reiterate that full, safe and unhindered access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and its technical equipment throughout the entire area foreseen by its mandate is essential.

It is crucial that the Minsk agreements are implemented by all sides. We expect Russia in particular to make full and immediate use of its influence on the separatists in this regard. The agreement reached in today's Trilateral Contact Group on a renewed ceasefire commitment for the holiday period is a necessary step, though immediate restraint in the meantime remains imperative.

Russia's withdrawal of its contingent from the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) also has serious negative implications for the maintenance of a ceasefire and on the stabilisation of the line of contact. We expect both sides to take all necessary measures so that the JCCC can resume its critical role in resolving serious security issues on the ground.

The European Union continues to support the ongoing diplomatic efforts towards full implementation of the Minsk agreements as the basis for a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine that respects Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.

2388479,"After 40 Years of Conflict in Afghanistan, Peace Process Still Not Assured, Special Representative Tells Security Council, Urging Timely Elections SC/13137  
21 DECEMBER 2017  
SECURITY COUNCIL  
8147TH MEETING (AM)  

After four decades of conflict in Afghanistan, a convincing peace process was still not assured, the top United Nations official for that country told the Security Council today, calling on the Taliban to express a clear willingness to begin negotiations.

In his periodic briefing, Tadamichi Yamamoto, the Secretary‑General’s Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), said a crucial issue was the holding of parliamentary elections in 2018, followed by presidential elections in April 2019.  He noted there had been insufficient progress on those preparations, as well as intense criticism from electoral stakeholders.  The Independent Election Commission needed to demonstrably advance preparations to regain its credibility.  UNAMA would continue efforts to advance women’s political participation.  Despite intense fighting, recent efforts by Afghan National Defence and Security Forces to protect civilians had resulted in reductions in civilian deaths and injuries, he said.

He said the Government’s goal to reduce reliance on aid and secure its own tax base would require concentrated efforts to stimulate the private sector, reduce corruption and red tape, and build infrastructure, after which Afghanistan’s mineral wealth could be exploited.  Although the achievements in regional cooperation were encouraging, he said the main dividends of regional cooperation could not be achieved until there was peace and stability.

“I truly hope that empathy for the ongoing suffering of millions of Afghans will move us all to make the efforts necessary to achieve peace and realize the important opportunities that lie beyond a much needed peace agreement,” he said.

Also briefing the Council, Yuri Fedotov, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), drew attention to the “unprecedented” highs in opium poppy cultivation and production, with an increase of almost 90 per cent to a record 9,000 metric tons in the past year.  Recent seizures showed interregional links between organized crime and terrorist groups exploiting drug manufacturing and trafficking.  It should be recognized that in recent years, attention had progressively shifted away from the threats posed by drugs.

He said comprehensive counter‑narcotics programmes which mainstreamed drugs in national development agendas were essential, including promoting alternative development to create new jobs, as well as access to education, financial services and markets.  Illicit financial flows must also be intercepted, he said, and prevention and treatment responses must be urgently scaled up.

Speaking in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), Kazakhstan’s representative said that the Committee had in 2017 removed one reportedly deceased individual from the sanctions list.  No other person or entity was delisted or added.  Emphasizing that implementation of the sanctions regime depended on internal, regional and international actors, he encouraged Member States to play a more active role in providing information that would help to keep the sanctions list up‑to‑date.

Wazhma Frogh, Founding Member of Women and Peace Studies Organization and Member of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council, said her country was still one of the most dangerous places for women.  In 2017, the Afghan Human Rights Commission had reported more than 5,000 cases of severe violence against women.  All Government and armed groups were still complicit in rape and extortion, she said.

She underlined the importance of the peace process including all sectors of society.  Even though women and children suffered from ongoing violence, women were excluded from the peace and reconciliation process.  Lasting peace could only be achieved if women sat at the negotiating table, she said.

The representative of Afghanistan said that the so‑called “fighting season” of the Taliban and other terrorist groups had nearly ended.  Those groups had failed to make any notable gains on the ground.  Increased dialogue was needed among regional and global powers, he said.  Turning to bilateral relations with Pakistan, he highlighted substantial improvements.  He said, “Afghanistan has the will and capacity to defend its territory and our patience should not be tested.”

Regarding peace efforts, he noted that the Kabul process was now fully operational and provided an overarching framework to harmonize international and regional efforts in that context.  The February meeting of that process would represent an opportune moment for the Taliban to change course, denounce violence and join the peace process.  He noted recent progress in implementing projects visualizing Afghanistan as a land bridge, business hub and trade and transit roundabout between Central Asia, South Asia, the Far East and the Middle East.

Speakers in the ensuing debate stressed the importance of an Afghan‑owned, Afghan‑led and Afghan‑controlled process, with the support of neighbouring countries through the 2018 meeting of the Kabul process.  Expressing concern about the increased levels of violence in the country, due to activities of the Taliban and terrorist groups such as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Daesh), they urged the former to participate in the reconciliation process.

Commending the effort of UNODC, speakers expressed concern at the increased opium cultivation and production, stressing the connection between criminal organizations and terrorist groups to fund the latter’s activities, and urged for regional and international cooperation in that regard.

The representative of the United States said Americans were impatient with the conflict in Afghanistan, but would continue to support Kabul in its efforts against Al‑Qaida, ISIL and the Taliban.  Her country did not intend to prolong the war in Afghanistan through military gains, but rather it sought to accelerate the peace, she said, emphasizing its commitment to an Afghan‑owned peace process.

Pakistan’s representative said that the war, violence and terrorism afflicting Afghanistan were the consequences of foreign military interventions, occupation and imposed war.  Preventing cross‑border terrorism was essential for both countries and could only be achieved through constant vigilance.  She reported that the armed forces of both counties agreed to place liaison officers in each other’s army headquarters and establish ground coordination centres.  She urged the Taliban to give up violence, stressing that the other side, too, must display a genuine desire for dialogue.

The representative of India said the Council had not effectively used its 1988 sanctions regime in the context of funds generated by terrorist networks.  “We need to go after the leaders of the terrorist organizations” and investigate and designate illicit drugs trafficking businesses, he said.  He drew attention to the New Development Partnership launched by Afghanistan and India in September, but regretted that overland access between the two countries had been blocked for many years.

The representatives of Japan, Italy, China, Ukraine, France, Russian Federation, Bolivia, Sweden, Uruguay, Senegal, Egypt, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Canada, Netherlands, Iran and Australia also spoke, as did the delegate of the European Union.

The meeting began at 10:20 a.m. and ended at 1:47 p.m.

Briefings

TADAMICHI YAMAMOTO, Special Representative of the Secretary‑General and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), speaking via video‑conference from Kabul, said “As the calendar year closes, we are still left to tackle the issue that concerns us most in Afghanistan:  a convincing peace process to end the forty years of conflict…”.  During the upcoming months, when conflict levels tended to decrease, the issue could be advanced.  The Kabul process planned for 1 February offered an opportunity.  The Government was expected to present a strategic concept for reaching a political settlement with the armed opposition.  The Government and international partners must focus on how levels of violence could be reduced.  He called on the Taliban to express a clear willingness to begin negotiations.

He said a crucial issue was the holding of parliamentary elections next year, followed by presidential elections in April 2019.  There had been, however, insufficient progress on electoral preparations, as well as intense criticism from electoral stakeholders.  The Independent Election Commission had removed its chairman.  It needed to demonstrably advance preparations to regain its credibility.  On 6 December, the Commission had announced the modalities for voter registration, which would result in a single, complete voter register, as well as polling station‑based voter lists.  That would significantly cut down on fraud, he stressed. Security was a defining factor enabling credible and inclusive elections.  UNAMA would continue efforts to advance women’s political participation.

Despite intense fighting, recent efforts by Afghan security forces to protect civilians had resulted in reductions in civilian deaths and injuries, he said, but remained concerned at the indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices and casualties from air strikes by pro‑Government forces.  The number of civilian casualties remained at terribly high levels.  He had also received disturbing reports of children being recruited by armed groups, mainly Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) and the Taliban, and urged the parties to immediately cease that unlawful practice.  He also encouraged the Government to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and to withdraw its reservations to the Convention.

Turning to the economic situation, he said the significant reduction of the international military presence in 2014 had led to a collapse in economic growth, from 10 per cent to less than 0 per cent.  Afghanistan was expected to reach positive growth for the second year, he said, but not enough to absorb the 400,000 young Afghans who annually sought to join the labour force.  The illicit economy was expanding and narcotics trades were a source of funds for insurgency.  For the Afghan economic development to succeed, the Afghan National Peace and Development Framework must be supported.

The Government’s goal to reduce reliance on aid and secure its own tax base would require intense efforts to stimulate the private sector, reduce corruption and red tape, and build infrastructure, after which Afghanistan’s mineral wealth could be exploited.  The past year had seen important progress on infrastructure development with an eye to connecting Afghanistan to Europe through the Caspian and the Caucasus, and to the Arabian Sea.  Those developments demonstrated how Afghanistan’s relationship with its neighbours presented opportunities for prosperity.  There were obstacles, however, he said, and expressed concern about increased military activities between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  He called on the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan to find ways of collaborating more effectively to address the issues.

Although the achievements in regional cooperation were encouraging, he said the main dividends of regional cooperation could not be achieved until there was peace and stability in the country.  That sequence could not be reversed.  “In the coming months, there must be significant progress on election preparations, real attempts to reduce violence and the move towards a credible peace process,” he said, adding that because of the cyclical nature of the conflict, opportunities that were missed in the next three months would in all likelihood be missed for the next year.

“I truly hope that empathy for the ongoing suffering of millions of Afghans will move us all to make the efforts necessary to achieve peace and realise the important opportunities that lie beyond a much needed peace agreement”, he said in conclusion.

YURI FEDOTOV, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), said the 2016 Afghan opium survey had showed a reversal in efforts to counter the drug problem.  One year later, the situation had become much worse, with the 2017 survey showing unprecedented highs in opium poppy cultivation and production, with an increase of almost 90 per cent to a record 9,000 metric tons.  The area under poppy cultivation had risen to 328,000 hectares.  “Let us make no mistake:  we face a genuine crisis, and our response must be urgent, swift and decisive,” he said.

The expected surge in high quality, low‑cost heroin posed negative consequences for Afghanistan, its neighbours and the many other transit routes or destinations, he said.  Recent seizures and analysis showed interregional links between organized crime and terrorist groups exploiting drugs manufacturing and trafficking.  It should be recognized that in recent years, attention had progressively shifted away from the threats posed by drugs.  That trend must be reversed, he stressed.

He said comprehensive counter-narcotics programmes which mainstreamed drugs in national development agendas were essential.  That would include promoting alternative development to create new jobs, as well as access to education, financial services and markets.  He called for support to build capacity, including for intelligence-led investigations, controlled delivery, eradication programmes and dismantling of opium processing labs.  Integrated border management, financial intelligence units and disruption of criminal networks was also necessary.  Regional and international cooperation should be strengthened to stop precursor chemicals from being diverted and trafficked into Afghanistan.   Illicit financial flows must also be intercepted and prevention and treatment responses must be urgently scaled up, most of all in Afghanistan.

He said UNODC was working with Afghanistan, neighbouring countries and the wider region to promote the needed integrated response.  It was currently seeking to step up regional and inter-regional action to counter the opium cultivation and production increases, including comprehensive support to implement the Afghan national Drug Action Plan, with Afghanistan in the lead.  There could be no success, however, without the engagement and renewed commitment of Member States.  “The international community cannot afford to do less,” he said.

KAIRAT UMAROV (Kazakhstan), speaking in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) pertaining to Afghanistan and the Taliban, said that in 2017, the 1988 Committee — at the Afghan Government’s request — removed one reportedly deceased individual from the sanctions list.  No other person or entity was de‑listed or added.  However, there were indications that the Government and others, in the coming months, would request delisting several individuals to further facilitate peace and reconciliation efforts.  In that context, the de‑listing of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar earlier this year by the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) concerning ISIL (Da’esh), Al‑Qaida, and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities, at the Afghan Government’s request, had had a positive impact through his participation in the political process, strengthening reconciliation prospects for others going forward, he said.

Turning to the Taliban, he said that since the death of its previous leader Mullah Mansour in 2016, its leadership ranks had faced internal friction, primarily between the pro‑Mansour faction and its new leader Haibatullah Akhundzada.  Such internal dissensions had not, however, affected the Taliban’s military capabilities.  It could still attack Afghan forces, Afghan people and the international community, and potentially threatening several provincial capitals, supported by income mainly from the narcotics economy and illegal extraction of natural resources.  The presence of ISIL/Da’esh and foreign terrorist fighters complicated the situation.  That being said, Afghan Government forces had maintained control over provinces and district headquarters in the face of heavy Taliban attack.  That pointed to an improvement in the Government’s fighting capacity, due in no small measure to the international presence in Afghanistan.  Emphasizing that implementation of the sanctions regime depended not only on internal actors, but also on regional and international actors, he encouraged Member States to play a more active role in providing information that would help to keep the sanctions list up to date.

The large-scale increase in opium production in Afghanistan was a worrying development, he said, with the Afghan Opium Survey 2017 highlighting an 87 per cent increase in opium production.  That trend must be addressed, as Taliban involvement in illegal opium production and trade could have earned it an estimated $400 million in annual income in 2016.  “Cutting off this financial stream would have a significant impact on the Taliban’s ability to resource its offensive against the Government of Afghanistan,” he said.  The overall effectiveness of the 1988 sanctions regime also depended on close coordination with the Government and the region, he said, noting his visit to Afghanistan in October for meetings that demonstrated the potential for greater use of sanctions to deter the Taliban and support the peace process.  At the same time, renewed efforts must be made to list Taliban-associated individuals and entities who, while not on the sanctions list, undertook activities that harmed Afghanistan’s peace and security.  Concluding, he said the 1988 Committee was keen to help the Government make wider use of the sanctions regime, and awaited its proposals for updating the sanctions list.  At the same time, all Member States were urged to assist in the sincere implementation of the sanctions measures.

WAZHMA FROGH, Founding Member of Women and Peace Studies Organization and Member of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council, addressing the meeting via video‑conference from Kabul, said that in the light of violence committed against civilians, particularly women, she appreciated the opportunity to address the Council.  Acknowledging that her Government had appointed several women to the cabinet and the judiciary and had made efforts to increase the number of women in the security forces, she said there were concerns about whether the elections would be convened on time, because the impact of armed groups had hindered progress.

She said Afghanistan was still one of the most dangerous countries for women.  In 2017, the Afghan Human Rights Commission had reported over 5,000 cases of severe violence against women.  The Taliban was spreading fear among women by such actions as shooting a woman for having links to the Government.  The Taliban had taken 300 children from families to be trained as soldiers.  All Government and armed group were still complicit in rape and extortion.  Although an action plan to address the issue had been developed, it had not been implemented.

She said the battle was fought in communities and markets, where the Taliban first attacked women.  Afghan women did not have a role in decisions on how to combat that violence.  Women could play a role in countering, at the local level, the radicalization of young men.  The younger generation did not have an opportunity to participate in governance or find jobs, which led to radicalization.  In August, 47 women and girls were taken by ISIL.  The Government continued to deny such events, as it would shed light on its inability to address the issue.

Noting that a negotiated settlement was the only solution, she underlined the importance of the peace process including all sectors of society, in particular women.  Although security sector reform had started in the past few months, and had yielded some practical results, there were no women in leadership positions, and women in lower level positions risked their lives.  Women did not have a seat at the Government’s Security Council.  Women and children suffered from ongoing violence, but women were excluded from the peace and reconciliation process.  Lasting peace could only be achieved if women sat at the negotiating table.

She also drew attention to the number of women’s organizations closing at an alarming level, and called on the international community and the Council to ensure funding for women’s organizations.  In closing, she said she looked forward to a presence of women at the Kabul Conference.

Statements

MAHMOUD SAIKAL (Afghanistan) said that the so‑called “fighting season” of the Taliban and other terrorist groups had nearly ended.  Those groups had failed to make any notable gains on the ground while suffering heavy manpower and morale losses.  His country’s security forces had proven their effectiveness in countering terrorist elements in independently conducted operations.  Moreover, they were also working to double the size of their special forces and triple the size of their air force, with support from international partners.  To consolidate such gains and achieve sustainable peace, increased dialogue was needed among regional and global powers, he said, hailing readiness expressed by President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation to cooperate with the United States in Afghanistan on counter‑terrorism and narcotics.

Turning to bilateral relations with Pakistan, he highlighted substantial improvements, citing the visit of a senior military and a parliamentary delegation from that country.  Violations across the Durand Line constituted a key hindrance to improving relations between the countries, and had resulted in the loss of innocent lives.  His country’s proposal for engagement and operational coordination in order to address those concerns had not seen any response, he noted, adding that “Afghanistan has the will and capacity to defend its territory and our patience should not be tested.”  He looked forward to the upcoming trilateral meeting in Beijing during the following week between the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan and China.

Regarding peace efforts, he noted that the Kabul process was now fully operational and provided an overarching framework to harmonize international and regional efforts in that context.  The February meeting of that Process would represent an opportune moment for the Taliban to change course, denounce violence and join the peace process.  Turning to the General Assembly resolution on Afghanistan, he said its effective implementation was imperative.  In security and counter‑terrorism, the implementation of the sanctions regimes of the 1988 and 1989 Security Council Committees must improve.  They were put in place to constrict the operational capacity, freedom of movement as well as flow of material resources in the region, all of which allowed terror to thrive.  However, those regimes were lax at best and struggled to achieve their mandates.  He voiced hope that relevant Council members would make necessary adjustments to enforce sanctions, underscoring the outstanding issues of freezing Taliban leaders’ assets and listing and de‑listing terrorist groups based on existing evidence and technical appraisal.

He went on to note progress made in 2017 in terms of implementing projects visualizing Afghanistan as a land bridge, business hub and trade and transit roundabout between Central Asia, South Asia, the Far East and the Middle East.  The Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan and the Heart of Asia‑Istanbul Process had progressed steadily.  Moreover, his country had also signed bilateral and other agreements with various countries in the region, he said, emphasizing that “terror cannot deter the course of development and prosperity of our country and the region.”  He expressed grave concern about increasing attacks on mosques and worshippers, noting that the Government had introduced measures to protect places of worship at risk.  Also, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), the role of Afghan women was becoming more prominent in the peace process.

KORO BESSHO (Japan) said that short‑term efforts by Afghan security forces to push back the Taliban and conduct anti‑terrorism operations were crucial, but only genuine progress on an Afghan‑led and Afghan‑owned peace process would significantly improve security in the long run.  Seeing no unity among regional stakeholders on that issue, Japan was worried that the lack of common understanding would exacerbate the environment for the Afghan Government in advancing peace.  He expressed hope that the second round of the Kabul process in February would yield tangible steps and clarify the role of UNAMA in the peace process.  Pointing then to opium poppy cultivation and illicit trafficking of opiates in Afghanistan, he said Japan was supporting the country to revive its legitimate agricultural sector.  Expanding agricultural productivity would allow the country to export products to neighbouring countries, strengthening regional cooperation.

ANDREA BIAGINI (Italy), associating himself with the European Union, emphasized the need to marry, on the one hand, the intrinsically domestic nature of an Afghan‑owned, Afghan‑led peace process with, on the other hand, genuine support from partner countries, particularly those in the region.  Effective and tangible collaboration would be needed to fight terrorist groups, he said, adding that the Kabul process must be complemented by full and inclusive outreach to all sectors of Afghan society, including women.  He went on to say that parliamentary elections in 2018 represented a fundamental opportunity to strengthen Afghan institutions.  The elections must be transparent and inclusive, he stated, underscoring the need to resolve outstanding issues regarding electoral reforms and tangible implementation of the Government’s wider reform agenda.

SHEN BO (China) underscored the importance of promoting national reconciliation, saying that all sides must put Afghanistan’s long‑term interests first through an Afghan‑owned and Afghan‑led process.  He welcomed the Afghan Government’s anti‑corruption and reform efforts, adding that political actors should be more united and resolve their differences through dialogue.  The international community should meanwhile honour its commitment to help Afghanistan and support its economic and social development.  Afghanistan enjoyed great prospects regarding regional economic cooperation, he said, adding that China hoped UNAMA would continue to respect Afghanistan’s sovereignty.

VOLODYMYR YELCHENKO (Ukraine), aligning himself with the forthcoming statement by the European Union, praised the Kabul process launched in June under the initiative of President Ghani and added that the Afghan‑led and Afghan‑owned national peace and reconciliation efforts should be prioritized.  Stressing the importance of taking concrete measures to move forward the national reform agenda through the Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework, he also congratulated the Government of Afghanistan for its determination to take effective measures for enacting obligations under international human rights law in connection with its election to the Human Rights Council.

ANNE GUEGUEN (France), noting that women were indispensable for establishing peace in Afghanistan, stressed her concern regarding the high level of violence in that country and terrorist groups joining the fight.  Civilians, particularly women and children, continued to pay the highest price.  Her country shared Afghanistan’s determination to fight terrorism.  The Government needed to pursue reforms underway, in particular in its electoral system.  She welcomed reforms being implemented to combat corruption.  She said that despite progress in programmes to eradicate areas of poppy production, cultivated areas had gone up with a doubling of output.  The situation of human rights was of great concern, she said, and urged the Government to honour its commitment to women.  She hoped the peace process could be resumed as soon as possible.  That process must be supported by all neighbouring countries, she said.

VLADIMIR K. SAFRONKOV (Russian Federation) noted that after the defeat of ISIL in the Middle East, that group had seized territory in the north of Afghanistan.  The secret to that success was the military support from outside sources.  Measures should be taken to clear the north of the country from terrorist elements which threatened also other nations in the region.  He was also concerned about the worsening drug situation in Afghanistan, with criminals and terrorists working together.  Support must be based on cooperation and national reconciliation.  National reconciliation could only happen if there was no competition between supporters, but a collective will.  Neighbouring States should participate in the process as terrorist groups also threatened them.  Noting that the Russian Federation and Afghanistan were historically connected by friendship, he said his country was ready to provide support, including through training of security and armed forces and was open to cooperation with the United States and others.

PEDRO LUIS INCHAUSTE JORDÁN (Bolivia) welcomed progress made by the Government, among other things in security sector.  Despite the current fragile political equilibrium, he was convinced the Afghanistan’s people had the will to establish democracy.  Concerned about the high number of armed groups, he said the priority the Government placed on the reform plan was key part of security strategy.  He was not encouraged by the fact that in the past year, 33,000 people had been displaced, and hoped international organizations would continue to provide aid to help the voluntary and safe return of refugees.  Highlighting the work of mine removal partners he said their efforts had enabled civilians to return home and work the land.  He called on regional partners to strengthen their commitment to cooperation.  While supporting the Kabul process, he underlined the importance of it being be inclusive, and guided by Afghans.

IRINA SCHOULGIN NYONI (Sweden), associating herself with the statement to be given by the European Union, said that only the Afghan people, working together, would determine Afghanistan’s future.  In that regard, the upcoming meeting under the Kabul process would be an important step, she said, underscoring also the tremendous potential for increased regional cooperation.  It was imperative for parliamentary elections in 2018 and presidential elections in 2019 to be carried out in an inclusive, credible and transparent manner, with women participating as voters and candidates.  Sweden deplored the recent execution of five prisoners and urged the Afghan Government to reinstate a de facto moratorium on the death penalty.  Increased recruitment of children by armed groups, including the Taliban, was a matter of deep concern.  She expressed her country’s strong support for the strategic review of UNAMA, adding that the Secretary‑General’s recommendations regarding the Mission should be implemented without delay.

KAIRAT UMAROV (Kazakhstan) said Central Asian States were particularly concerned about the rising level of terrorist activities by ISIL’s Afghan faction in the northern provinces of the country.  The increase of drug production in 2017 was also alarming, as it fuelled terrorist operations and had a negative effect on the entire region.  Noting the nexus between security and development, he said close economic cooperation between the countries of the region would facilitate the integration of Afghan citizens into the reconciliation process, reducing their involvement in organized crime and opium production.  It would also significantly strengthen the country’s potential by contributing to economic growth, increasing trade and creating opportunities.

LUIS HOMERO BERMÚDEZ ÁLVAREZ (Uruguay) said there was no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan, where the parties must come together to find a political alternative.  Maximum effort must be made to end the cycle of violence and embark on a path that would lead to talks between the Government and the Taliban.  The Kabul process required the international community’s support, he said, encouraging the Afghan Government to continue its reform programme, focusing on strong and independent institutions and a solid democratic process.  He underscored the role of Afghan women and their direct participation in the peace and reform processes.  He expressed concern about the humanitarian situation, saying all parties to the conflict must respect humanitarian principles, human rights and international humanitarian law.  Concluding, he said Afghanistan must be able to count on support from the United Nations, Member States and others.

MICHELE J. SISON (United States) drew attention to President Donald Trump’s national security strategy, saying nowhere was that approach more evident than in her country’s regional strategy towards Afghanistan.  Americans were impatient with the conflict in Afghanistan, but it would continue to support Kabul in its efforts against Al‑Qaida, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Taliban.  United States support would be based not on timelines, but on a realistic assessment of the situation on the ground.  She said additional American resources, ordered by President Trump, were having an impact on the battlefield, with significant progress being made against ISIL in eastern Afghanistan.  Enhanced United States support had also bolstered the confidence of Afghan partners, she added.

The United States did not intend to prolong the war in Afghanistan through military gains, but rather it sought to accelerate the peace, she said, emphasizing its commitment to an Afghan‑owned peace process.  The Taliban and other spoilers could not win on the battlefield.  Peace would only come through a political settlement.  The United States, the Security Council and the international community were unified in pursuing a durable political settlement that would lead to a lasting peace.  She underscored the important role played by UNAMA, adding that Afghanistan’s neighbours must help as well.  There could be no enduring peace unless those neighbours were fully committed to that goal.  She went on to say that the United States stood ready to work with any nation that was prepared to play a constructive role in Afghanistan.  Much work also needed to be done to combat opium production, which meant more income for the Taliban and other insurgent groups.  Concluding, she said her country shared the world’s impatience to end the conflict, but that impatience could be an asset if it was directed towards renewed peace efforts.

FODÉ SECK (Senegal) said his country was concerned by the fragile situation in Afghanistan as the 2018 elections drew closer.  Political stakeholders were encouraged to de‑escalate tensions and ensure that the security situation did not deteriorate further.  A high level of violence had led to loss of life, including among women and children, while having a negative impact on the human rights, humanitarian, economic and social situation.  The presence of international forces remained particularly important, alongside Afghan Government efforts to promote national dialogue, combat instability and protect civilians.  He welcomed progress in the fight against torture, encouraged greater women’s participation, and hailed joint efforts by the United Nations and its partners in ensuring regular humanitarian assistance.  He also emphasized the need to combat drug trafficking.

SEIF ALLA YOUSSEF KANDEEL (Egypt) welcomed preparations for the 2018 elections and supported Afghanistan authorities in their political efforts to uphold security and development.  Welcoming the collective commitment to fight terrorism and noting the escalation of terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, he encouraged partners at the national and international level and Afghan authorities to combat drugs in tandem with fighting terrorism.  He welcomed several economic and investment initiatives to support Afghan development and underlined the importance of regional organizations, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.  He called for an integrated United Nations vision to uphold peace, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region.

DAWIT YIRGA WOLDEGERIMA (Ethiopia) said Afghanistan still faced complex challenges.  The security situation remained volatile, compounded by the presence of ISIL in the country.  Welcoming the continued reform activities of the Government, including fighting corruption, he underlined the importance of adhering to the timeline for the 2018 elections.  He noted with concern that there had been no significant steps towards a peace process with the Taliban.  Welcoming bilateral and multilateral cooperation, he stressed the importance of UNAMA efforts in supporting peace consultations.  He stressed that without development, the peace and security challenge could not be addressed, and urged the international community to deliver on its various commitments.

JONATHAN GUY ALLEN (United Kingdom) said Afghanistan continued to face challenges to peace and stability.  Significant progress had been made, however, he said, noting that there was now a democratic Government and that security forces were protecting civilians.  He underlined the importance of holding timely elections, protecting human rights and the peace process being Afghan‑owned and led.  Elections were essential to long term stability, he said, and called on the Government to deliver the elections the people deserved.  As an Afghan‑led and owned peace process was the only solution to the conflict, he urged the Taliban to participate.  He called on all parties to engage with the Afghan Government in the Kabul process.  Welcoming the essential part UANAMA played, including its work to promote women’s participation in the elections, he urged for full implementation of the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security.

CHRISTOPH HEUSGEN (Germany), associating himself with the European Union, said timely elections in Afghanistan would be important to ensure the success of a comprehensive political process.  Germany supported a credible and inclusive peace process that included women, youth and civil society.  He emphasized the important role of regional players, adding that an increase in opium production could have detrimental effects vis‑à‑vis the peace process.  He called for a halt to the recruitment of child fighters, and for Afghanistan to abolish the death penalty and join the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

MALEEHA LODHI (Pakistan) said that the war, violence and terrorism afflicting Afghanistan were the consequences of foreign military interventions, occupation and imposed war.  The peoples of that country and Pakistan were bound by mutual interdependence and other ties, she said, noting that approximately 3 million Afghans still resided in Pakistan.  To strengthen bilateral relations, her delegation had in November proposed a comprehensive Afghanistan‑Pakistan Action Plan for Solidarity.  Preventing cross‑border terrorism was essential for both countries and could only be achieved through constant vigilance, effective management and real‑time communication.  Regular contact between their armed forces and intelligence agencies was needed to prevent violent incidents along the border.  To that end, the two armed forces had agreed to place liaison officers in each other’s army headquarters and establish ground coordination centres.  A conglomerate of terrorists from various parts of the world had emerged as a new threat in Afghanistan, located in 40 per cent of its territory.  It appeared that ISIL/Da’esh’s “core” might be relocating there, posing a threat to all its neighbours.  She further noted that peace could not be restored by military force.  “You cannot kill and talk at the same time,” she said, urging the Taliban to give up violence and stressing that the other side, too, must display a genuine desire for dialogue.

GÜVEN BEGEÇ (Turkey) urged the international community to consolidate support for Afghanistan and fulfil its commitments.  He stressed the importance of unity in the Afghan Government, which was essential for peace and security.  Afghan owned and led peace and reconciliation efforts were key in that regard.  He encouraged cooperation between the countries in the region, and stressed his country’s willingness to contribute to that process so that Afghanistan could become a stable country with good relationships with its neighbours and welcomed in that regard the recently concluded transport agreement.

BAKHTIYOR IBRAGIMOV (Uzbekistan) said the only route to peace in Afghanistan was direct dialogue between the central Government and main domestic political forces without preconditions.  An Afghan‑led inclusive peace process under the auspices of the United Nations was essential for achieving long‑term peace and stability in the country.  The international community should look at Afghanistan as a strategic opportunity that could serve as a solid foundation for promoting multifaceted cooperation conducive to common prosperity and well‑being.  His Government was taking coherent steps to galvanize international support for integrating Afghanistan into regional economic networks.  In November, his country had hosted an international conference on ensuring security and sustainable development in Central Asia.  In the final communique, delegates supported initiatives aimed at backing the Afghan peace process, promoting the reconstruction of socioeconomic infrastructure and integrating the country more actively into global economic networks.

MICHAEL BONSER (Canada) stressed the importance of women’s full and equal participation in all facets of Afghan life, as they continued to suffer a disadvantage in the country.  With the 2018 elections approaching, it was essential to encourage and support the meaningful participation of women as both candidates and informed voters.  He also underscored the need for economic development, which could be supported through the Heart of Asia‑Istanbul Process and the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan.  Noting intensified fighting in Afghanistan in 2017, he then pointed to the importance of the peace process, stressing that negotiations between the Government and armed opposition were vital.  He expressed deep concern over the deterioration of security in the country, especially its impact on women and children.

LISE GREGOIRE‑VAN HAAREN (Netherlands), associating herself with the European Union, and recalling that her country would be the Council penholder on Afghanistan from January 2018, said the potential of Afghan women was far from fulfilled.  Increasing their participation in all aspects of Afghan society would contribute significantly to a more stable and prosperous nation.  She called on the Afghan Government to continue to fund and implement the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security and the National Priority Programme for Women’s Economic Empowerment, and urged UNAMA to hire more female local staff members.  She went on to note the Netherlands’ contribution to the Afghan National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security through the €2 million Safhe Jaded programme to increase security and justice for women and girls.

JOANNE ADAMSON, European Union, expressed the bloc’s full commitment to supporting an Afghan‑led and Afghan‑owned peace process, which must include all Afghan men and women and their legitimate interests, preserving Afghanistan’s unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and equal rights under the country’s constitution.  She said the bloc also supported the Kabul Process and other meaningful international efforts feeding into it, adding that it should encourage more regional discussions to increase cooperation towards peace and stability.  On 16 October, the European Union Council had adopted a new European Union Strategy on Afghanistan, laying out a path for a coherent, ambitious and forward‑looking strategy for the bloc’s engagement and partnership with that country.  It focused on promoting peace, stability and regional security; reinforcing democracy, the rule of law and human rights; promoting good governance and women’s empowerment; supporting economic and human development; and addressing migration-related challenges.  Also, a Brussels‑based Special Envoy to Afghanistan had been appointed to complement the work of the European Union delegation in Kabul.

In terms of human rights, she recalled that, on 10 December, the European Union had observed Human Rights Day with the meeting of grassroots human rights defenders in Kabul.  However, the bloc was also concerned by the execution of five prisoners on 29 November, she said, calling on Afghanistan to re‑establish its moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty.  Human rights would now form part of the structured dialogue between the European Union and Afghanistan under the Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development framework.  On elections, she welcomed the announcement of the parliamentary elections in 2018, but noted signs technical and political difficulties, calling for efforts to resolve such difficulties and make the elections possible within the announced timeframe in a democratic, inclusive, transparent and credible manner.  In that regard, the bloc had committed €15.5 million to assist in the elections under UNAMA’s coordination.  On migration, she noted the implementation of the European Union-Afghanistan Joint Way Forward, as well as the reintegration assistance programme adopted in 2016, aimed at ensuring a sustainable reintegration of returnees from the European Union and neighbouring countries.  That support would soon be complemented by a new regional programme on migration and forced displacement with a budget of €200 million, of which Afghanistan would be the main beneficiary.

ESHAGH AL HABIB (Iran) said the Afghan National Unity Government was at the forefront in fighting terrorists — in particular, the Taliban, Al‑Qaida, Da’esh and its affiliates — as well as other extremist groups and criminals, including those in the narcotics trade.  The sustained support of the international community was needed to support the Government in that fight as well as to address Afghanistan’s complex security, economic and political challenges.  The reported 87 per cent growth in opium production over the past year was alarming, as narcotics provided a major source of income for terrorist groups.  The international community must support relevant international and regional projects and activities, including those carried by Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan within the framework of the triangular initiative to counter narcotics.

TANMAYA LAL (India), expressing serious concern about the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, said support for terrorist organizations such as the Taliban, the Haqqani network, Da’esh, Al‑Qaida and its designated affiliates, including Lashkar‑e‑Taiba and Jaish‑e‑Mohammed from outside the country, must be forced to stop.  All safe havens and sanctuaries available to such groups beyond Afghan borders must end, he said, emphasizing the Security Council’s important responsibility in that regard.  Increased opium production was another serious concern, but the Council had not effectively used its 1988 sanctions regime in the context of funds generated by terrorist networks.  “We need to go after the leaders of the terrorist organizations” and investigate and designate illicit drugs trafficking businesses, he said.  Support for an Afghan‑led, Afghan‑owned and Afghan‑controlled peace and national reconciliation process must be pursued with all sincerity.  However, meaningful progress would require a cessation of violence, renunciation of links with international terrorism, and respect for the rights of common Afghan people, especially women and children.   He drew attention to the New Development Partnership launched by Afghanistan and India in September, but regretted that overland access between the two countries had been blocked for many years.  Efforts were being made to address that issue, with a first consignment of wheat from India recently reaching Afghanistan via Chabahar port in Iran.  Concluding, he said the challenges were well‑known, but that the tools available to the Council and the international community to address them must be utilized effectively with collective will and targeted action.

DAVID GREGORY YARDLEY (Australia), congratulating Afghanistan for overcoming significant security, political and humanitarian challenges in 2017, said that conducting parliamentary elections in 2018 would be crucial for political credibility.  While the Afghanistan Parliament’s recent confirmation of 11 ministerial nominees would bring more certainty to domestic politics, the failure to gain confirmation for the single female nominee was discouraging, he noted.  Looking forward to the Kabul process meeting in February 2018, he added that enhanced engagement between Afghanistan and Pakistan was crucial for regional stability.  2017 had been a year of reflection and realignment for the international community’s approach to Afghanistan, he said, urging the full implementation of recommendations of the UNAMA strategic review.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2388369,"Security Council Presidential Statement Reaffirms Commitment to Enhance All Stages of Conflict Prevention, Peacebuilding Efforts (S/PRST/2017/27) SC/13139 

SECURITY COUNCIL 8149TH MEETING (PM) 

The Security Council today reaffirmed its commitment to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in addressing conflict at all stages, from prevention and settlement of disputes to post‑conflict peacebuilding, employing a context‑specific response and utilizing the full range of tools available.

In presidential statement S/PRST/2017/27, presented by Koro Bessho (Japan), Council President for December, the 15‑member organ reaffirmed basic principles of the maintenance of international peace and security. Those principles ranged from the primary responsibility of States and national ownership in peacebuilding to the need for clear and achievable mandates for United Nations peace operations. 

The Council underscored the need to enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of United Nations peacekeeping by improving mission planning, increasing resource pledges — including for niche capabilities — and by reinforcing peacekeeping performance through training. It also underlined the importance of partnership with regional organizations and other relevant United Nations bodies, particularly as the Peacebuilding Commission.

The Council expressed its intention to consider a range of elements that could improve the effectiveness of peace operations, including assessment of mandate implementation to ensure the full delivery of mandated tasks and adaptation of mandates when necessary. It also stressed the need for strategic and integrated analysis of the opportunities, risks and challenges faced by national and local authorities in their efforts to build and sustain peace.

The meeting began at 3:52 p.m. and ended at 3:53 p.m.

Presidential Statement

The full text of presidential statement S/PRST/2017/27 reads as follows:

“The Security Council recalls its resolutions 1645 (2005), 2086 (2013) and 2282 (2016), and its presidential statements PRST/2009/24, PRST/2011/17, PRST 2012/29 and PRST/2015/22.

“The Security Council reaffirms its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as its commitment to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter, including its commitment and respect to the principles of political independence, sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all States in conducting all peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities and the need for States to comply with their obligations under international law.

“The Security Council recognizes that ‘sustaining peace’, as drawn from the Advisory Group of Experts report, should be broadly understood as a goal and a process to build a common vision of a society, ensuring that the needs of all segments of the population are taken into account, which encompasses activities aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, addressing root causes, assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction and development, and emphasizing that sustaining peace is a shared task and responsibility that needs to be fulfilled by the government and all other national stakeholders, and should flow through all three pillars of the United Nations’ engagement at all stages of conflict, and in all its dimensions, and needs sustained international attention and assistance.

“The Security Council reiterates its commitment to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in addressing conflict at all stages from prevention to settlement to post-conflict peacebuilding” and further considers the importance of context-specific continuum of response, utilizing the range of tools available for the United Nations to maintain international peace and security.

“The Security Council reaffirms the primary responsibility of national governments and authorities in identifying, driving and directing priorities, strategies and activities for sustaining peace, and in this regard, emphasizes that inclusivity, including by ensuring full and effective participation of women, is key to advancing national peacebuilding processes and objectives in order to ensure that the needs of all segments of society are taken into account.

“The Security Council reaffirms the importance of national ownership and leadership in peacebuilding, whereby the responsibility for sustaining peace is broadly shared by the Government and all other national stakeholders.

“The Security Council stresses that the primacy of politics should be the hallmark of the approach of the United Nations to the resolution of conflict, including through mediation, the monitoring of ceasefires, assistance to the implementation of peace accords.

“The Security Council reaffirms the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the mandate, and recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific to the need and situation of the country concerned, and that the Security Council expects full delivery of the mandates it authorizes”

“The Security Council welcomes the contribution of peacekeeping operations to a comprehensive strategy for durable peace and security, also recalls their critical role in the maintenance of international peace and security, preventing and containing conflicts, promoting compliance with international norms and Security Council decisions and building peace in post-conflict situations, as well as their role in protecting civilians. The Security Council further recalls the primary responsibility of States to protect civilians and to respect and ensure the human rights of all individuals within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction, as provided for by relevant international law.

“The Security Council reiterates that peacekeeping ranges from traditional peacekeeping missions, which primarily monitor ceasefire, to complex multidimensional operations, which seek to undertake peacebuilding tasks and address root causes of conflict.

“The Security Council emphasizes the important role that effective and responsive leadership in United Nations country operations can play in bringing together the United Nations system around a common strategy for sustaining peace, and in this regard, stresses the need for more coordinated, coherent and integrated peacebuilding efforts, including among United Nations missions, United Nations country teams, and national, regional and international development actors, in ensuring greater effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of critical peacebuilding tasks.

“The Security Council recognizes the need to weigh the full range of responses, when addressing a situation, which may endanger international peace and security, and to deploy United Nations peacekeeping missions and pursue peacebuilding efforts only as an accompaniment, not as an alternative, to a political strategy that addresses, among other elements, the root causes of conflict.

“The Security Council recognizes that effective peacebuilding must involve the entire United Nations system, and in this regard, emphasizes the importance of joint analysis and effective strategic planning across the United Nations system in its long-term engagement in conflict-affected countries and, where appropriate, in cooperation and coordination with regional and subregional organizations.

“The Security Council welcomes the contribution of peacekeeping operations to a comprehensive strategy for sustaining peace, and notes with appreciation the contributions that peacekeepers and peacekeeping missions make to peacebuilding.

“The Security Council emphasizes the importance of integrated analyses of opportunities and challenges for sustainable peace and its relevance to developing a clear vision of context-specific solutions in countries emerging from conflicts that should guide integrated planning processes for peacekeeping missions.

“The Security Council stresses the importance of grasping the challenges of peacebuilding and sustaining peace from the inception of a peacekeeping mission through integrated strategic assessment and planning processes, so as to ensure coherence between, and integration of peacekeeping and peacebuilding to achieve an effective response to post-conflict situations from the outset.

“The Security Council stresses the importance of considering clear, achievable, sequenced and phased mandates, where appropriate, based on enhanced analysis and planning when evaluating existing or establishing new United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Security Council further stresses the importance of complementing efforts aimed at peacebuilding and sustaining peace undertaken by national and local authorities, as well as by, United Nations and other partners, throughout the life cycle of a mission and as an important component of planning towards drawdown and exit, with a view to strengthening nationally led processes and capacities.

“The Security Council emphasizes that effective implementation of mandates requires the deployment of peacekeepers and personnel with professional skills, training, experience, excellence and in adherence to the United Nations zero‑tolerance policies for misconduct and sexual exploitation and abuse, and recalls in this regard the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The Security Council acknowledges the valuable role of troop- and police-contributing countries, and encourages them, in the spirit of partnership, to continue to contribute professional military and police personnel with the necessary skills and experience to implement peacekeeping mandates, including appropriate language skills at relevant levels.

“The Security Council recognizes the need to further strengthen the cooperation and consultations with troop- and police-contributing countries, including through triangular cooperation between the Security Council, the troop- and police-contributing countries and the Secretariat, in areas where military and police contingents undertake early peacebuilding tasks, and encourages active participation of all stakeholders in open and more frequent consultation processes with a view to improving the delivery of peacebuilding tasks in the field.

“The Security Council underscores the need to enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of United Nations peacekeeping, throughout all phases of mandate implementation, by improving mission planning, increasing the number of relevant pledges of capabilities, including niche capabilities, enablers, engineering, medical and rapid deployment units, as well as reinforcing peacekeeping performance through training, and to fulfil the pledges made by a number of Member States at the various multilateral meetings held in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for peacekeeping missions.

“The Security Council recognizes the importance of adequately resourcing the peacebuilding components of relevant United Nations peacekeeping missions and special political missions, including during mission transitions and drawdown, to support continuity and sustainability of peacebuilding activities.

“The Security Council recalls resolution 2320 (2017) and underlines the importance of partnership and cooperation with regional and subregional arrangements and organizations, including the African Union, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, in supporting peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities; and acknowledges in this regards the efforts being made by the African Union through the deployment of African Union Peace Support Operations authorized by the Security Council, operationalization of African Union Policy on Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development and its relevant initiatives particularly the African Solidarity Initiatives, and takes note of the decision of its Assembly number AU/Dec.351(XVI) on the establishment of an African Union Centre for Post Conflict Reconstruction.

“The Security Council acknowledges the importance of strong coordination, coherence and cooperation with the Peacebuilding Commission, in accordance with its resolutions 1645 (2005) and 2282 (2016), and in this regard, expresses its intention to regularly request, deliberate and draw upon the specific, strategic and targeted advice of the Peacebuilding Commission, including to assist with the longer-term perspective required for sustaining peace being reflected in the formation, review and drawdown of peacekeeping operations and special political missions mandates.

“The Security Council emphasizes the importance of drawing upon the advice of the Peacebuilding Commission when major agreements that relate to United Nations mission mandates and transitions are agreed between the United Nations, national governments and authorities, and other relevant stakeholders. 

“The Security Council expresses its intention to consider, when and where relevant and on a case by case basis, the following elements related to peacebuilding and sustaining peace, when reviewing the mandates and configuration of peacekeeping missions:

1. assessment of mandate implementation in all its dimensions, including cooperation of the host state, with a view to ensuring the full delivery of the mandated tasks as well as, when relevant, the adjustment of tasks to better contribute to peacebuilding and sustaining peace; 

2. support for a consultation process within the mission that supports and reinforces national ownership of the political processes; utilization of dedicated good offices and technical expertise within the missions to support national political processes; 

3. existence of clearly defined goals and objectives guided by specific agreed upon milestones towards peacebuilding and sustaining peace; 

4. periodic strategic and integrated analysis of the opportunities, risks and challenges faced by national and local authorities to build and sustain peace, including challenges related to building and strengthening national capacities to this end;   

5. progress in and quality of delivering the political and operational aspects of the mission’s mandate in a coherent manner, in coordination with the United Nations Country Team and in cooperation with other relevant international and regional partners, including financial institutions 

6. clarity on roles and responsibilities of United Nations peacekeeping operations, United Nations country teams and other relevant actors, including entities of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture and the United Nations Agencies, Funds and Programmes for the delivery of prioritized support to a country, consistent with its specific peacebuilding needs and priorities, as outlined by national authorities, in order to ensure effective integration of effort; as well as to support efforts aimed at addressing the root causes of conflict, within their respective mandates; 

7. existence of an exit strategy that seeks to help lay the foundation for long term and sustainable peace; including through supporting national capacities, with the support, where appropriate, of bilateral, regional and international stakeholders, including international financial institutions.   

“The Security Council takes note of the intention expressed by the Secretary-General to conduct reviews of peacekeeping missions, and requests the Secretary-General to reflect, as appropriate, in his relevant reports, analysis of progress made in and recommendations pertaining to the aforementioned elements.”

2388364,"General Assembly Overwhelmingly Adopts Resolution Asking Nations Not to Locate Diplomatic Missions in Jerusalem GA/11995  

GENERAL ASSEMBLY PLENARY
TENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION, 37TH MEETING (AM)  

**Those Supporting Text Will Be Remembered, United States Warns, as It Garners 128 Votes in Favour, 9 Against, 35 Abstentions**  


The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly during a rare emergency meeting today to ask nations not to establish diplomatic missions in the historic city of Jerusalem, as delegates warned that the recent decision by the United States to do so risked igniting a religious war across the already turbulent Middle East and even beyond.

By a recorded vote of 128 in favour to 9 against (Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Togo, United States), with 35 abstentions, the Assembly adopted the resolution “Status of Jerusalem”, by which it declared “null and void” any actions intended to alter Jerusalem’s character, status or demographic composition.  Calling on all States to refrain from establishing embassies in the Holy City, it also demanded that they comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions and work to reverse the “negative trends” imperilling a two‑State resolution of the Israeli‑Palestinian conflict.

“We meet today not because of any animosity to the United States of America,” insisted Riad Al‑Malki, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Palestine.  Instead, the emergency session had been called to make the voice of the vast majority of the international community — and that of people around the world — heard on the question of Jerusalem/Al‑Quds Al‑Sharif.  He described the 6 December decision by the United States to recognize the city as Israel’s capital, and to move its embassy there, as an aggressive and dangerous move, cautioning that it could inflame tensions and lead to a religious war that “has no boundaries”.

He went on to state that the decision would have no impact on the Holy City’s status, but it nevertheless compromised the role of the United States in the peace process.  Moreover, it did nothing but serve the forces of extremism around the world, he said, pointing out that even the closest allies of the United States could not turn a blind eye to its actions.  The Assembly was meeting in the wake of the Security Council’s failure to adopt a similar draft resolution, even as 14 of its 15 members had voted in its favour.  “The veto will not stop us,” he declared in that regard, underlining that Al‑Quds “will not fall to any siege, monopolization or domination”.

The representative of the United States, however, said she stood firmly behind the Administration’s decision, declaring:  “America will put its embassy in Jerusalem.”  Its citizens would remember today’s votes, including the countries that had disrespected the United States and singled it out, she warned.  Pointing out her country’s standing as by far the largest single contributor to the United Nations, she said its contributions were intended to advance its national values and interests, but when such an investment failed, the Government would be obliged to spend its resources “in more productive ways”.

Israel’s representative, meanwhile, said one‑sided anti‑Israel resolutions had been pushing the Middle East peace process back for years.  The Assembly remained in constant open session when it came to Israel, though the world was full of conflict, he noted, adding that the recent decision by the United States only declared what had always been true:  “Jerusalem has been, and always will be, the capital of the State of Israel.”  Today’s vote, therefore, was nothing more than the performance of a delusion, and the text did absolutely nothing to improve the lives of the Palestinian people.

At the meeting’s outset, Yemen’s representative presented the draft resolution in his capacity as Chair of the Arab Group and one of its two main co‑sponsors, the other being Turkey, current Chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).  Describing the decision by the United States as a blatant violation of the rights of the Palestinian people, as well as those of all Christians and Muslims, he emphasized that it constituted a dangerous breach of the Charter of the United Nations and a serious threat to international peace and security, while also undermining the chances for a two‑State solution and fuelling the fires of violence and extremism.

Venezuela’s delegate, speaking for the Non‑Aligned Movement, expressed grave concern about Israel’s ongoing violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including attempts to alter the character, status and demographic composition of the City of Jerusalem.  Also concerned about the decision to relocate the United States embassy, he warned that such provocative actions would further heighten tensions, with potentially far‑reaching repercussions given the extremely volatile backdrop.

Malaysia’s representative echoed those sentiments, rejecting the Jerusalem decision as an infringement on the Palestinian people’s rights.  It had also caused dismay and frustration across the Muslim world, he added.  Since the issue lay at the heart of the Palestinian cause, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital endorsed Israel’s brutal occupation and repressive policies, he said.  “We are concerned that this dire situation will only feed into the agenda of the extremists and frustrate our collective efforts in our bigger objective of combating terrorism and ending the vicious cycle of violence.”

Several delegates spoke in explanation of position, with Australia’s representative explaining that she had abstained because although her country’s Government did not support unilateral action that undermined the peace process, it did not believe today’s text would help to bring the parties back to the negotiating table.

Canada’s representative said he had abstained because the resolution was one‑sided and did not advance the prospects for peace.

Meanwhile, Paraguay’s representative said he had abstained because his delegation’s position was that the question of Jerusalem was a matter for the Security Council, as the primary body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security.

Mexico’s representative said he had also abstained, while emphasizing that convening an emergency session was a disproportionate response.  The United States must become part of the solution, not a stumbling block that would hamper progress, he emphasized, noting that the international community was further than ever from agreement.

Also speaking were representatives of Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia, Maldives, Syria, Bangladesh, Cuba, Iran, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, South Africa, Estonia (on behalf of several States), El Salvador, Argentina, Romania, Nicaragua, Czech Republic, Armenia, Hungary and Latvia, as well as the Permanent Observer for the Holy See.

The General Assembly will reconvene at a date and time to be announced.

Introduction of Draft Resolution

KHALED HUSSEIN MOHAMED ALYEMANY (Yemen), introducing draft resolution A/ES‑10/L.22, titled “Status of Jerusalem”, expressed regret at the decision by the United States to exercise the veto against the draft resolution that Egypt had submitted in the Security Council on behalf of the Arab Group.  It was intended to protect the City of Jerusalem and block any attempt to change its historical character, he said, emphasizing that the United States decision of 6 December was considered null and void and would have no impact on the city’s status.  Furthermore, it was a blatant violation of the rights of the Palestinian people, as well as all the world’s Christians and Muslims.  Describing the decision further as a dangerous breach of the Charter of the United Nations, he said it constituted a serious threat to peace and security in the region and the entire world.  It also undermined any chances for a two‑State solution and fuelled the fires of violence and extremism, he said.

Stressing that Jerusalem was a vital part of the territory of Palestine, he called upon all States, including the United States, to refrain from measures contravening the historic status quo and from establishing diplomatic missions in the Holy City, as per Security Council resolutions.  He strongly condemned all Israeli policies, practices and plans that were illegal and aimed at the annexation of East Jerusalem, rejecting all steps to change the Holy City’s legal status.  Commending the steadfastness of the Palestinian people, seeking to protect their rights in the face of aggression, he said Israel’s occupation of Arab lands was the source of all tension in the Middle East and there would be no security in the region without a solution that would ensure the Palestinian people’s legitimate rights to their own State, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

As Chair of the Arab Group, and in cooperation with Turkey as Chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), he presented the draft resolution elaborating that any steps to alter the character, status or composition of the City of Jerusalem had no legal affect, were null and void and must be immediately rescinded.

Statements

RIAD AL‑MALKI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Palestine, said his delegation had called for today’s emergency meeting to make the international community’s voice heard on the question of Al‑Quds [Jerusalem].  The position shared by the vast majority of nations was embodied in the reactions of people around the world, he noted, recalling that a draft resolution that would have declared any action to change the city’s character to be “null and void” had been vetoed in the Security Council earlier this week, despite having received support from 14 of that organ’s 15 members.  “The General Assembly now has the right to take up this issue,” he said, pointing out that there was an international consensus on the dangerous nature of the 6 December decision by the United States to recognize Al‑Quds as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there.

“We meet today not because of any animosity to the United States of America,” he said, explaining that it was because of the aggression reflected by its recent decision.  It would not impact the status of the Holy City whatsoever, but would instead impact the role of the United States itself in the peace process, he cautioned.  Expressing regret that his delegation’s warnings that such actions could inflame religious tensions had gone unheeded, he further warned that the decision could lead to a religious war that “has no boundaries”.  Indeed, the decision did nothing but serve the forces of extremism around the world, and no credible voice seeking peace could ever support it, he said, pointing out that even the closest allies of the United States could not turn a blind eye to its actions.  Al‑Quds was a holy and historic city that “will not fall to any siege, monopolization or domination”, he declared.

Today was an opportunity for the United States to join the international community in helping to prevent the escalation of conflict, he continued.  While the State of Palestine respected the sovereignty of all States, it refused to have that principle used as an excuse to deny Palestinians their rights.  “We stand today united for justice,” he declared, stressing “the veto will not stop us”.  The State of Palestine would not accept any justification — security, religious or otherwise — to excuse Israel’s continued occupation, he said, underlining that the United Nations was today undergoing an unprecedented test “with Palestine as its headline”.  Citing the unity of many of the Organization’s organs — including the Assembly, the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, the International Court of Justice and others — on the question of Jerusalem, he stressed:  “History records names, and remembers names,” including those standing up for what was right, and those speaking falsehoods.

While Palestinians had never wavered in their support of peace, colonialism and peace could not coexist, he said, emphasizing that there could not be peace for just one side.  Warning Member States not to use the excuse of supporting dialogue to avoid their responsibilities under international law, he urged them to hold accountable those who committed violations, recognize the State of Palestine and help provide both security and dignity to its people.  He cited recent examples of the “barbarism of the Israeli regime”, saying they included attacks against Palestinian civilians and children.  As the world prepared to celebrate Christmas, “the lights will not be lit in the land of Christ”, he added.  Al‑Quds would remain dark in affirmation of the Palestinian people’s unity around their cause.  By voting in favour of the draft resolution, Member States would be standing up for justice and rejecting attempts at blackmail and intimidation, he said.  “Those who want peace must vote for peace today.”

MEVLÜT ÇAVUŞOĞLU, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, described the vote as an important reminder that Palestinians — subjected to systematic violence and discrimination for generations — were not alone.  The only hope for a just and lasting peace in the region was a Palestinian State based on the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.  However, the recent decision by a Member State to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital violated international law and was an “outrageous assault” on universal values, he emphasized.  He recalled that the 13 December Summit of OIC had unanimously rejected that decision and declared East Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine.  Since Jerusalem was the holy city of three monotheistic religions, it was the responsibility of all to preserve its historic status, he said, recalling that a Member State had threatened others before the meeting to vote “no” or face the consequences.  The Assembly would not bow to such bullying, he declared, underlining that it was unethical to think that the votes and dignity of Member States were for sale.  A vote in favour of the Palestinian people would place Member States on the right side of history.

NIKKI R. HALEY (United States) said the United Nations had long been a hostile place for Israel, which undermined the Organization’s credibility and was harmful for the entire world.  Israel must not only stand up for its own survival, but also for the ideals of freedom and human dignity, which was what the United Nations was supposed to be about, she said, adding that being forced to defend her country’s sovereignty had brought many of the same thoughts to her mind.  Pointing out that the United States was by far the single largest contributor to the United Nations, which it did in order to advance its values and interests, she said that together they had made tremendous advances in a wide range of areas.  The United States was demonstrating “the American way” when it provided generous contributions to the United Nations, yet it also had the legitimate expectation that its efforts would garner the world’s goodwill and respect, she said, adding that it was being asked to pay for the dubious privilege of being disrespected.  Emphasizing that the Government of the United States was held accountable by its people, she said it had the obligation to ask for more for its investment, and when that investment failed, it also had the obligation to spend in more productive ways.

The United States had already made its decision in accordance with United States law dating back to 1995, she continued, adding that it had been repeatedly endorsed by its people.  The decision did not preclude any final status issues, including the status or boundaries of Jerusalem, nor did it preclude a two‑State solution or harm peace efforts.  Rather, the decision reflected the will of the American people and the right of the United States to move its embassy where it saw fit.  “There is no need to describe it further.”  She said her delegation would remember the day it was singled out and attacked in the General Assembly for exercising its right to act as a sovereign nation.  It would remember that day when it was asked to make the single largest contribution to the United Nations, or when it was called upon to use its influence.  “America will put its embassy in Jerusalem,” she said, emphasizing:  “It was what the American people wanted the Government to do.”  The way in which Americans viewed the United Nations and the way in which countries had disrespected the United States with today’s vote would be remembered, she vowed.

DANNY DANON (Israel) said the one‑sided steps by the Palestinians and the United Nations had pushed peace away for years.  With every anti‑Israel resolution, with every attack on the Israeli people, the United Nations had perfected its double standard.  Despite living in a world full of conflict and war, only when it came to Israel did the Assembly remain in constant open session, he said.  The United States had only declared what had always been true, he continued, emphasizing:  “Jerusalem has been, and always will be, the capital of the State of Israel.”  The vote was nothing more than the performance of a delusion, and the draft resolution did absolutely nothing for the lives of the Palestinian people, he said, describing it as nothing more than a distraction.

He went on to state that Israel knew Jerusalem was sacred to billions around the world and encouraged everyone to visit and pray in the Holy City.  There was a particular irony in the draft resolution in that its co‑sponsors accused Israel and the United States of violating international law, yet it was in those countries where terrorist groups found fertile ground.  The United Nations preached human rights and peace, but when it came to Israel, Member States completely ignored the horrific acts of terror that threatened Israeli citizens.  Violence and terror must never be tolerated, he stressed, adding that if the United Nations was really united for peace, it would pass a resolution condemning Palestinian violence.  On the contrary, today’s draft resolution encouraged more violence and instability, he said, warning that it sanctioned Palestinians to continue on a dangerous path.

SAMUEL MONCADA ACOSTA (Venezuela), speaking on behalf of the Non‑Aligned Movement, expressed grave concern about the ongoing violations perpetrated by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including attempts aimed at altering the character, status and demographic composition of the City of Jerusalem.  Expressing further grave concern about the declared intentions and plans announced by the President of the United States to transfer his country’s embassy to Jerusalem, and any other related action that would further consolidate Israel’s control and unlawful de facto annexation of the city, he warned that such provocative actions, in disrespect of Security Council resolutions, would further heighten tensions, with potentially far‑reaching repercussions.  In that regard, he called for a halt to all violations and provocations by the Government of the United States, recalling the principles and purposes enshrined in the United Nations Charter, including the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force.

He went on to caution that, against the backdrop of an extremely volatile situation and with diminishing prospects for a just peace, such unlawful actions in Jerusalem could seriously destabilize the fragile situation on the ground.  The Security Council underlined in its resolution 2334 (2016) that it “will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations”, he noted.  It also called on all parties “to refrain from provocative actions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, with the aim, inter alia, of de‑escalating the situation on the ground, rebuilding trust and confidence, demonstrating through policies and actions a genuine commitment to the two‑State solution, and creating the conditions necessary for promoting peace”.  The Non‑Aligned Movement reaffirmed the commitment of its member States to the realization of a just, lasting and peaceful solution to the question of Palestine in all aspects and in accordance with international law, he stressed.

MALEEHA LODHI (Pakistan) said the unilateral actions of one country were set to undo decades of work by the international community and to defy international law.  Pakistan rejected the decision by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocate its embassy to the Holy City in contravention of several provisions of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, she declared.  Member States must recommit to thwarting any attempts to violate the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the ultimate goal of a two‑State solution.  Expressing unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, she said it was a key pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy, recalling that her country had led and sponsored the Assembly’s first‑ever resolution on Jerusalem.  In that regard, Pakistan was proud to join the international community once again in adopting a landmark draft resolution to reject the “revisionist” decision of the United States.

DIAN TRIANSYAH DJANI (Indonesia) described the decision by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital as unacceptable and in violation of a number of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.  Recalling that Security Council resolution 478 (1980) called upon States to withdraw diplomatic missions from the Holy City, he said that text would remain valid until peace was attained for the Palestinians.  Any attempts to change the character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, were in flagrant violation of international law, constituting a major obstacle to comprehensive peace and the realization of a two‑State solution, he said, underlining Indonesia’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.

ALI NASEER MOHAMED (Maldives) said the current international system, which had emerged with the founding of the United Nations, was based on international law and every Member State, including Israel, was bound to respect and implement resolutions of the Security Council in good faith.  By adopting today’s draft, the international community would send a clear message to Israel and the handful of countries supporting its illegal actions, he said.  Emphasizing that Jerusalem’s final status could only be decided through a negotiated settlement, he appealed to Israel to withdraw from its illegal occupation of Palestine, stressing that the centre of gravity in international politics was shifting towards the rule of law, and no Power was too great to ignore that reality.

MOUNZER MOUNZER (Syria), condemning the decision to transfer the United States embassy to the occupied city of Al‑Quds and to recognize it as Israel’s capital, said it constituted a flagrant violation of the city’s special status and yet another demonstration of colonial crimes committed against Palestine.  The decision was unilateral in nature and had no impact on the city’s legal status, he said, underlining that the United States had never, and would never, stand as a neutral party in the Middle East peace process.  Condemning that country’s use of the veto in the Security Council, he pledged that his delegation would never renounce its unwavering support for the rights of Christians, Palestinians and Muslims in the city of Al‑Quds.  Indeed, Syria stood firmly for the right of the Palestinians to self‑determination and to an independent State with Al‑Quds as its capital, as well as their right of return and their right to stand as a full Member State of the United Nations.  Calling upon the United States to respect all resolutions of the Assembly and the Security Council on the matter, he said that country’s arrogance had now risen to the level of directly threatening Member States, declaring:  “This is a superpower which views the United Nations as a national institution”, adding that it treated other Member States like schoolchildren.

MASUD BIN MOMEN (Bangladesh), associating himself with the Non‑Aligned Movement and OIC, reaffirmed his country’s position on East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent and viable State of Palestine.  Bangladesh was concerned about any decision or announcement that could compromise East Jerusalem’s status as a final status issue in the Middle East peace process, change its historical and legal status, or alter its demographic structure and historic Arab‑Islamic character, he said.  It was also concerned about possible grave consequences and threats to international peace and security that could result from such an inflammation of tensions.  Urging all sides to take a pragmatic approach to the peace process by negotiating a two‑State solution with the aim of bringing about lasting peace and stability in the region, he said Bangladesh supported all efforts to resolve protracted conflicts, especially against the backdrop of its own efforts to deal with the massive, ongoing influx of forcibly displaced persons from neighbouring Myanmar’s Rakhine State.

ANAYANSI RODRÍGUEZ CAMEJO (Cuba), associating herself with the Non‑Aligned Movement and voicing support for the statements delivered on behalf of OIC and the Arab Group, said her delegation had made its position clear in its 6 December declaration “on the recognition by the United States of the City of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel”.  Quoting from that document, she said:  “Cuba expresses its deepest concern and rejection of the [United States] President’s unilateral declaration on the City of Jerusalem […] which is a serious and flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, of international law and of the relevant UN resolutions.”  Warning that the decision would have serious consequences for stability and security in the Middle East, she called upon the Security Council to fulfil its Charter responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, including by demanding that Israel immediately end its occupation.  Cuba would continue to support a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Palestinian‑Israeli conflict on the basis of a two‑State solution, as well as the right of the Palestinians to self‑determination and to an independent, sovereign State with its capital in East Jerusalem and within the pre‑1967 borders, she stressed.

GHOLAMALI KHOSHROO (Iran) said that the United States had been aiding and abetting the Israeli regime by according it unconditional support and defending it by any means necessary.  The United States had misused its veto power in the Security Council to shield the regime against the will of the international community, and its recent illegal decision made it clear that the United States sought only to secure the Israeli regime’s interests and did not respect the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self‑determination.  The Israeli occupation lay at the centre of all crises and conflicts in the Middle East and beyond, a fact long acknowledged by the United Nations, he said.  He strongly condemned the reckless, unilateral attempt by the United States to distort the historical facts and replace them with fiction.  That country’s Administration had done little to hide its intentions to shift the Security Council’s focus from the question of Palestine to fabricated “alternative issues” in the region in order to give the Israeli regime more space to freely pursue its criminal practices.

SHEN BO (China), highlighting the Palestinian question’s position at the core of Middle East issues, said it had a profound impact on peace efforts in the region.  In that context, the situation of Jerusalem had particular complexities.  Calling upon the international community to remain united in the joint pursuit of peace and to facilitate de‑escalation of the situation for the greater good of stability and tranquillity, he said a two‑State solution was the right path to a political settlement of the Palestinian question.  China firmly supported the Middle East peace process and the rights of the Palestinian people, including a fully sovereign State of Palestine, he declared, emphasizing that his delegation’s position would never change.  China would continue to play a constructive role in the quest for a political solution to the question of Palestine.

M. SHAHRUL IKRAM YAAKOB (Malaysia), associating himself with OIC and the Non‑Aligned Movement, said his country also joined the international community in expressing its deep concern over, and rejection of, the 6 December decision of the United States on Jerusalem.  “Such a move undermines efforts towards finding a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the Palestinian‑Israeli conflict,” he emphasized, noting that it had caused dismay and frustration across the Muslim world.  The decision infringed on the rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self‑determination, and contravened Security Council resolutions.  Since Al‑Quds was at the heart of the Palestinian cause, recognizing it as Israel’s capital served to endorse Israel’s brutal occupation and repressive policies, he pointed out.  “We are concerned that this dire situation will only feed into the agenda of the extremists and frustrate our collective efforts in our bigger objective of combating terrorism and ending the vicious cycle of violence,” he stressed.

JA SONG NAM (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) recalled that, during the seventieth summit of the Non‑Aligned Movement, its members had committed to supporting the interests of developing countries on issues relating to international peace and security, and to strengthening multilateralism through various United Nations instruments.  In that vein, the Security Council had adopted a resolution in 2016 that demanded Israel end its illegal settlement activities on Palestinian land.  The recent decision on Jerusalem was an insult to the unanimous will of the international community, he said, stressing that the Middle East conflict must be resolved through peaceful dialogue between the parties.  Condemning that decision as “reckless and high‑handed”, he urged the United States to pay greater attention to international efforts to resolve the conflict, in accordance with international law and in conformity with Security Council resolutions.  Concluding, he expressed his delegation’s support for the Palestinian people and their efforts to establish an independent, sovereign State with Al‑Quds as its capital.

WOUTER HOFMEYR ZAAYMAN (South Africa) expressed his delegation’s deep concern that unilateral action by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital undermined the progress made within the context of the Middle East peace process.  The decision by the Government of the United States was regrettable and not constructive in advancing sustainable peace in the region.  The Government of South Africa remained in favour of a two‑State solution for Palestine and Israel, based on international recognition and independence of a State of Palestine, he said, appealing to the United States Administration to reconsider its decision to relocate its embassy, which compromised and undermined the principles of a two‑State solution based on peaceful coexistence between the peoples of Israel and Palestine.

TOMASZ GRYSA, Permanent Observer for the Holy See, emphasized that Jerusalem was most sacred to the three monotheistic religions and a symbol for millions of believers around the world who considered it their “spiritual capital”.  The Holy City’s significance went beyond the question of borders, a reality that should be considered a priority in every negotiation for a political solution.  The Holy See called for a peaceful resolution that would ensure respect for the sacred nature of Jerusalem and its universal value, he said, reiterating that only international guarantee could preserve its unique character and status, and provide assurance of dialogue and reconciliation for peace in the region.

Action

The Assembly then adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 128 in favour to 9 against (Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Togo, United States), with 35 abstentions.

Explanation of Position

The representative of Estonia, speaking on behalf of a group of Member States, reiterated their firm commitment to a two‑State solution as well as their unchanged position on East Jerusalem.  They would continue to respect the international consensus embodied in Security Council resolution 478 (1980) until Jerusalem’s final status was resolved.  Furthermore, the status quo around the Temple Mount must be upheld in full respect for previous understandings and for Jordan’s special role.  A negotiated two‑State solution was the only realistic way to realize the peace that both Israelis and Palestinians deserved.

The representative of Australia said that while her country’s Government did not support unilateral action that undermined the peace process, it did not believe the resolution would help to bring the parties back to the negotiating table.  For that reason, Australia had abstained from the vote, but hoped nevertheless that Israel and the Palestinians would return to the talks as soon as possible.

The representative of Paraguay said his delegation had abstained because the matter was still before the Security Council, which was responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security.  Furthermore, the issue should be resolved directly by both parties.

The representative of El Salvador reiterated his support for a negotiated two‑State solution with full respect for all Security Council resolutions.  However, he expressed regret that drafts were being tabled without enough time for discussion, adding that, as such, his delegation had abstained to demonstrate its unhappiness with the procedure around the draft.

The representative of Argentina said he had abstained because the draft would not help to resolve the conflict between the parties, emphasizing that the abstention did not imply a change in his delegation’s view of the situation.  Argentina supported all attempts to bring about peace in the Middle East, he said, urging the international community to make a joint effort to uphold a two‑State solution, as per the Arab Peace Initiative and the road map of the Middle East Quartet.

The representative of Romania said his delegation’s position concerning the status of Jerusalem was in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly.  Calling for calm, he encouraged the parties to resume dialogue so as to move the peace process forward, stressing that the time had come to renew international efforts to relaunch the peace process.

The representative of Canada said he had opted to abstain because the draft resolution was one‑sided and did not advance the prospects for peace.  Emphasizing the importance of Jerusalem, he condemned the violence and terrorism of the past weeks.

The representative of Nicaragua said he had voted in favour of the draft resolution because it rebuffed recent unilateral attempts to modify the character and status of Jerusalem.  Such unilateral actions were in blatant violation of resolution 2234 (2016) and others, he said, stressing that unilateral actions jeopardized peace and stability in the Middle East and drew the international community further away from a solution.

The representative of Mexico said he had abstained.  Noting that the international community was further from agreement today than ever before, he said it was disproportionate to convene an emergency session of the General Assembly.  The United States must be part of the solution and not an additional stumbling block hampering progress.  Mexico would keep its embassy in Tel Aviv, he underlined.

The representative of the Czech Republic said that while his delegation supported the European Union position, it had nevertheless abstained because it did not believe the draft resolution would contribute to the peace process.

The representative of Armenia said his country’s position remained unchanged.  The situation should be resolved through negotiations paving the way for lasting peace and security.

The representative of Hungary said her delegation did not comment on the foreign policy decisions of the United States and its position on the issue remained unchanged.

The representative of Latvia said his delegation’s position remained unchanged.  Jerusalem’s status must be negotiated through direct talks, and the city must become the capital of both Israel and a future State of Palestine.  Latvia had abstained because it was important not to escalate the political and security situation in the region.

The representative of Estonia took the floor a second time to clarify that she had delivered her statement on behalf of Albania, Lithuania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY PLENARY  
SEVENTY-SECOND SESSION, 74TH MEETING (AM)  

**Increasing Official Development Assistance, Updating Bank Policies to Support 2030 Agenda among Resolutions Approved**  

Gearing up to implement the international community’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the General Assembly today adopted 41 resolutions and two related decisions aimed at strengthening nations’ efforts to reach agreed goals.

At the meeting’s outset, the Assembly also adopted, without a vote, a resolution on restructuring the United Nations peace and security pillar, presenting what several delegates described as “sweeping” proposals to overhaul it.

By the resolution’s terms, the Assembly took note of a Secretary‑General’s report containing five proposals, including the creation of a single political‑operational structure under Assistant Secretaries‑General with regional responsibilities, and establishment of a “Standing Principals’ Group” of the Under‑Secretaries‑General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and for Peace Operations.

Focusing then on the Second Committee, the Assembly turned to macroeconomic policy questions, adopting a resolution on international financial system and development in a recorded vote of 180 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions.  By that text, the Assembly stressed that development banks should make optimal use of their resources and balance sheets, updating their policies to support of the 2030 Agenda.

By further terms, the Assembly committed to substantially curb illicit financial flows by 2030 by combating tax evasion, transnational organized crime and corruption through strengthened national regulation and increased international cooperation and reducing opportunities for tax avoidance.

Adopting another resolution on external debt sustainability and development, the Assembly stressed creditor and debtor responsibility in avoiding build‑up of unsustainable debt to diminish the risk of crisis.  By further terms, it urged countries to direct resources freed by debt relief to sustained economic growth and internationally agreed development goals.

By a resolution on commodities, adopted in a recorded vote of 182 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions, the Assembly directed the international community to address factors creating structural barriers to international trade, impeding diversification and limiting access to financial services.  By other terms, it called on relevant stakeholders to address low industrialization and diversification of economies of some commodity‑dependent developing countries.

Other resolutions on macroeconomic policy questions concerned unilateral economic measures, international trade, financial inclusion, illicit financial flows and financing for development.

Focusing on special groups of countries, the Assembly adopted a draft on Follow‑up to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.  By that text, the Assembly underlined the urgent need to reverse the decline in official development assistance (ODA) to least developed countries, urging nations that had not met commitments to increase their contribution and make concrete efforts towards ODA targets.

By another resolution on Development cooperation with middle‑income countries, it encouraged shareholders in multilateral development banks to develop a graduation process (from a nation’s lesser developed status) that was sequenced, phased and gradual.

Addressing sustainable development, the Assembly adopted several resolutions, including one on disaster risk reduction, emphasizing that preventing and reducing such risk would provide exponential returns and significantly curtail response costs.  It also emphasized the importance of increasing the availability of multi‑hazard early warning mechanisms in ensuring early action.

According to another draft, the Assembly called for ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, adopting it in a recorded vote of 183 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with 1 abstention (Venezuela).  It also called on Governments to expand the use of renewable energy beyond the power sector to industry, heating and cooling, infrastructure and the transport sector.

Adopting a further draft on combating sand and dust storms, it recognized that such weather had inflicted substantial economic, social and environmental damage on the inhabitants of the world’s arid, semi‑arid and dry subhumid areas, underscoring the need to treat and promptly take measures to address them.

Other sustainable development resolutions spotlighted development of the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan, sustainable tourism development in Central America, agricultural technology, desertification, biological diversity, education, camelids and World Bee Day.

Turning to a related item, the Assembly adopted a resolution on agriculture development, food security and nutrition in a recorded vote of 185 in favour to 1 against (United States), with no abstentions. By that text, the Assembly stressed the need to increase sustainable agricultural production globally by improving markets and trading systems as well as increasing responsible public and private investment in agriculture, land management and rural development.

By further terms, it stressed that a universal, rules‑based, open, non‑discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system promoted rural development and contributed to world food security and nutrition.  It urged national, regional and international strategies to promote the participation of farmers, fishers and fish workers in their various markets.

The Assembly also adopted a resolution concerning natural resources in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Syrian Golan in a recorded vote of 163 in favour to 6 against (Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, United States) with 11 abstentions, which called for Israel to cease exploitation of natural resources in those territories.

Further to the text, the Assembly called on Israel to comply with international law and cease all policies and measures to alter the character and status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  It also called on Israel to stop harming the environment, cease destruction of vital infrastructure, remove obstacles to the implementation of critical environmental projects, and cease efforts impeding Palestinian development.

Resolutions were also adopted on transport links, agricultural technology, small islands, global climate, harmony with nature, oil slick on Lebanese shores, human settlements, globalization, science and technology, culture, landlocked developing countries, poverty eradication, women, human resources, operational activities, South‑South cooperation and family farming.

Committee Rapporteur Theresah Chipulu Luswili Chanda introduced its reports.

Also adopted, without a vote, was a plenary resolution on a world against violence and violent extremism.  Introducing that text, Iran’s representative urged Member States to avoid associating violent extremism with any single religion or nationality, adding that the Assembly could provide a platform to address the roots of that phenomenon.

The resolution spotlighted international efforts to combat violent extremism and reaffirmed the importance of the Secretary‑General’s Plan of Action on the matter.

In other business, the Assembly took note of a report of its General Committee and several appointments to the Committee on Conferences.  Botswana, France and the Russian Federation were appointed to serve three‑year terms on the Committee beginning on 1 January 2018.  The Assembly also noted that the Asia‑Pacific Group had recommended China’s appointment to fill a vacancy on the Committee for a term of office beginning on the date of appointment and ending on 31 December 2019.

Introduction of Draft Resolution and Reports

MIROSLAV LAJČÁK (Slovakia), President of the General Assembly, introducing a draft resolution titled “Restructuring of the United Nations peace and security pillar” (document A/72/L.33), said the Organization must be able to respond to today's challenges “in the best way it can”.  However, there were new conflicts today that were harder to identify, as in the case of online recruitment of terrorist groups.  “Different threats require different responses,” he said, calling for adjustments to the Organization’s seventy‑year‑old mechanisms.  “We must evolve,” he stressed, noting that the resolution before the Assembly today would assist in that process, as it called for a second comprehensive report on the United Nations peace and security pillar.  Thanking the facilitators, he urged Member States to adopt the text by consensus.

The representative of Colombia, speaking in explanation of position on that item, said the resolution was critical to help make the United Nations more modern and transparent.  It contained a “visionary proposal” by the Secretary‑General, who had been chosen specifically “for this important task”.  Today’s peace and security challenges required bold measures to save lives, he said, adding that the resolution marked an important step forward in transparency.  It would also provide more feedback on “what is working and what is not working on the ground” in the United Nations efforts to enhance sustainable international peace.

The Assembly then adopted the draft resolution without a vote.

The representative of the United States said the United Nations would be better able to address the needs of those on the ground with more focused, effective and efficient operations.  Any reform that was implemented must advance political solutions and enable the Organization to tailor its responses to the needs of countries in conflict or transition.  The resolution demonstrated that the Secretary‑General had wide‑reaching endorsement from Member States for his vision to make the United Nations a stronger and more relevant institution that could prevent and respond to conflicts and atrocities.

The representative of Mexico said his country had joined consensus on the resolution, as it supported the Secretary‑General in his vision to make the United Nations a stronger organization.  It was critical to have the full backing of the Assembly so that the proposal could be implemented as soon as possible.  However, it seemed contradictory that the resolution on the reform of peace and security did not include references to sustainable development or the 2015 review process.  He expressed hope that the Secretary‑General’s report would be substantive in helping the Organization move towards greater understanding and the paradigm shift that peace required.

The representative of Argentina, welcoming the Secretary‑General's initiative to reform the United Nations peace and security pillar, said the Organization should adopt a holistic and comprehensive approach to conflict prevention, building sustainable peace and development.  The text would help decrease the fragmentation in the Organization’s work, she said, adding that the “sweeping” proposal would help the United Nations focus more closely on the root causes of conflict, ensure national ownership, enhance conflict prevention and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Voicing support for efforts to make the Peacebuilding Office a “liaison” between the various relevant organs of the United Nations, she stressed that “we must move forward”, and expressed hope that the upcoming work would reflect an active exchange of ideas between all Member States.

The representative of China voiced support for the United Nations efforts to better implement the responsibilities entrusted in it by its Charter, as well as to enhance multilateralism.  Also welcoming efforts aimed at integrating the Organization’s resources and improving its efficiency, thereby allowing it to better respond to today's peace and security challenges, he said the restructuring of the United Nations peace and security architecture would also require greater consultation between Member States.

The representative of the Russian Federation, noting that his delegation had joined in the consensus, said the changes proposed would also impact the Organization’s political dimensions.  Voicing his delegation’s commitment to engage in all discussions going forward, he expressed full respect for the points of view of various Member States, and said the final analysis must help them reach a “mutual understanding”.  While the interlinked relationship between the United Nations three pillars underpinned the Organization’s work, that did not mean that they must be carried out in the same way.  In that regard, he expressed support for the Secretary‑General’s efforts to avoid duplication of labour as well as ensure geographical representation.

The representative of Egypt agreed that the non‑traditional challenges emerging in global peace and security issues required new ideas and a more efficient use of the United Nations toolkit.  Stressing that the Assembly and its organs were the only entities that could adopt any of the restructuring proposals — and that such an adoption must be undertaken with full respect for the mandates of all the United Nations organs without any amendments to those mandates — he warned against including controversial elements which had not been fully agreed by Member States.  In addition, he said, Egypt considered sustainable development to be a right and a standalone objective in itself, which must be achieved without any preconditions.

The representative of Brazil said the United Nations needed to be nimbler if it was to implement all initiatives under the pillars of peace and security, development and human rights.  His country supported reform of the peace and security pillar and welcomed efforts to overcome fragmentation in focusing on restructuring peacebuilding.  However, he said reform would not be complete without reference to the work methods of the Security Council.

The representative of Estonia, speaking on behalf of the European Union, said the Assembly had expressed strong support for the Secretary‑General and reform of the Secretariat’s peace and security pillar.  He looked forward to a detailed report of all aspects of the new pillar.  The Secretariat must act as one while taking into account specificities of all facets on the ground, as through such efforts it could improve on efforts to maintain peace.  The Secretary‑General had the authority and now full political endorsement in proceeding with the first steps of implementing his vision.  With adoption of the resolution, the Assembly had set in motion not only reform but also a good precedent for other reforms.

THERESAH CHIPULU LUSWILI CHANDA (Zambia), Rapporteur of the Second Committee, introduced that body’s reports and the draft resolutions or decisions within, noting oral revisions for some.

Action on Draft Resolutions

The Assembly then turned to draft resolutions in the reports, beginning with a text on information and communications technologies for development (document A/72/417), which it adopted without a vote.

By that text, the Assembly called on all stakeholders to make bridging digital divides a priority, put into effect sound strategies contributing to the development of e‑government and continue to focus on pro‑poor information and communications technology policies and applications.

Next, it took up Macroeconomic policy questions, taking note of the report and adopting a resolution on Unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries (document A/72/418/Add.1) in a recorded vote of 130 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States) with 48 abstentions.  By that text, the Assembly would call for the elimination of such measures against those States.

It then adopted a resolution on International trade and development (document A/72/418/Add.1) in a recorded vote of 182 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions.  By that text, the Assembly promoted a universal, rules‑based, open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non‑discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (WTO) as well as meaningful trade liberalization.

Following that, the Assembly adopted a text on International financial system and development (document A/72/418/Add.2) in a recorded vote of 180 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions.  By that text, the Assembly resolved to strengthen the coherence and consistency of multilateral financial, investment, trade and development policy and environment institutions and platforms.

Next, it adopted, without a vote, a resolution on External debt sustainability and development (document A/72/418/Add.3), by which it stressed the responsibilities of creditor and debtor nations in avoiding the build‑up of unsustainable debt to diminish the risk of crisis.  By further terms, it urged countries to direct resources freed by debt relief to sustained economic growth and internationally agreed development goals.

The Assembly then adopted a draft on Commodities (document A/72/418/Add.4) in a recorded vote of 182 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions.  By that draft, the Assembly would have the international community address factors that created structural barriers to international trade, impeded diversification and limited access to financial services, particularly for developing countries.

By other terms, it called on relevant stakeholders to address the issue of the low industrialization and diversification of the economies of some commodity‑dependent developing countries.

Next, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, a text on Financial inclusion for sustainable development (document A/72/418/Add.5), by which it encouraged Member States to adopt and pursue national financial inclusion and gender‑responsive strategies to end structural barriers to women’s equal access to economic resources.

It then adopted, without a vote, a resolution on Promotion of international cooperation to combat illicit financial flows in order to foster sustainable development (document A/72/418/Add.6).  By that draft, the Assembly expressed concern that cryptocurrencies were increasingly being used for illicit activities.  It called for greater international cooperation and sustained dialogue to combat illicit financial flows and strengthen good practices on assets return.

The representative of Nigeria said efforts by his country and Norway had led to the establishment of the interlink between achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and combating illicit financial flows, which had been endorsed in numerous fora including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.  While his delegation had expected a more robust outcome, the adopted resolution was sufficient, he said, and appealed to Member States to further request a report by the Secretary‑General on how the issue was central to achieving the 2030 Agenda.  The Assembly setting up an intergovernmental body would be key to coordinating relevant mandates, he said, adding that most developing countries supported that idea.  The African Union’s annual theme would in 2018 be “Winning the fight against corruption:  A sustainable path to Africa’s Transformation”.  Nigeria stood ready to contribute toward holding the high‑level conference on illicit financial flows and asset recovery which would be convened by the President of the seventy‑third General Assembly.  Urging Member States to share information to combat illicit financial flows, he underscored that returning stolen assets had a more positive impact than focusing on conditionalities hindering developing countries’ progress.

Following that, the Assembly adopted a draft, without a vote, on Follow‑up to and implementation of the outcomes of the International Conferences on Financing for Development (document A/72/419).

Turning to sustainable development, the Assembly adopted a resolution on Oil slick on Lebanese shores (document A/72/420) in a recorded vote of 163 in favour to 7 against (Australia, Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, United States), with 9 abstentions (Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Tonga, Vanuatu).  By that text, it noted that the oil slick damage to Lebanon amounted to $856.4 million in 2014, and the Assembly requested the Government of Israel to provide compensation to Lebanon for the damage and to other countries directly affected by the oil slick, such as Syria.

The Assembly then adopted, without a vote, a text on International Year of Camelids, 2024 (document A/72/420), by which it encouraged all Member States, the United Nations system and other actors to take advantage of the International Year to promote awareness among the public of the economic and cultural importance of camelids.

It then adopted, without a vote, a text on international cooperation and coordination for the human and ecological rehabilitation and economic development of the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan (document A/72/420).  By that text, the Assembly urged the international community to assist Kazakhstan in implementing special programmes and projects to treat and care for the affected population, as well as efforts to ensure economic growth and sustainable development in the Semipalatinsk region.

Following that, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, a resolution on sustainable tourism and sustainable development in Central America (document A/72/420), by which it stressed the need to promote the further development of sustainable tourism and strengthen the development of ecotourism, maintaining the culture and environmental integrity of indigenous and local communities.

Next, it adopted a draft on Agricultural technology for sustainable development (document A/72/420) in a recorded vote of 152 in favour to 1 against (Syria), with 29 abstentions.  By that text, the Assembly urged stakeholders to strengthen efforts to improve the development of sustainable agricultural technologies and their transfer and dissemination to developing countries.

The representative of Slovenia said that after three years of effort, the resolution on World Bee Day had received its final endorsement.  In the last three years, since the beginning of the initiative of the Slovenian Beekeeper’s Association in 2014, his country had been intensively notifying States around the world on a political as well as an expert level.  In the frame of the official procedures, the initiative had been unanimously adopted by the Conference of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations at its fortieth session in Rome in July.  After that endorsement, it was transmitted to the Assembly, and on 17 November the resolution was adopted by the Second Committee.  Global food security was a key social issue and an important priority in the development of agriculture.  A third of all food produced in the world depends on pollination, and bees had an important role to play in the preservation of ecological balance and biodiversity.  They were also good bioindicators of environmental conditions.

The Assembly then adopted a text, in a recorded vote of 131 in favour to 48 against, with 4 abstentions (Liberia, New Zealand, Norway, Turkey), on Implementation of Agenda 21, the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (document A/72/420/Add.1).

Following that, it adopted, without a vote, a text on Disaster risk reduction (document A/72/420/Add.3), by which the Assembly emphasized that preventing and reducing such risk would provide exponential returns and significantly curtail response costs.  It also emphasized the importance of increasing the availability of and access to multi‑hazard early warning mechanisms in ensuring early action.

The Assembly then adopted, without a vote, a draft on Protection of global climate for present and future generations of humankind (document A/72/420/Add.4).  By that text, it emphasized that mitigation of and adaptation to climate change represented an immediate and urgent global priority.  It also urged Member States to strengthen mechanisms and provide adequate resources towards achieving the full and equal participation of women in decision‑making at all levels on environmental issues.

Next, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, a text on Implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa (document A/72/420/Add.5).

Following that, it adopted a draft, without a vote, on implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity (document A/72/420/Add.6), by which the Assembly called on Governments and all stakeholders to take appropriate measures to mainstream consideration of socioeconomic impacts and benefits of conserving and sustainably using biodiversity and its components, as well as ecosystems providing essential services, into relevant programmes and policies at all levels.

The Assembly then adopted a text, without a vote, on Education for sustainable development in the framework of the 2030 Agenda (document A/72/420/Add.7).  By that draft, it called on the international community to provide inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels — early childhood, primary, secondary, tertiary and distance education, including technical and vocational training — so that all people had access to lifelong learning opportunities that help them exploit opportunities to participate fully in society and contribute to sustainable development.

Following that, it adopted, without a vote, a text on Harmony with Nature (document A/72/420/Add.8), by which the Assembly decided to continue observing International Mother Earth Day annually.  It also called for holistic and integrated approaches to sustainable development in its three dimensions that guided humanity to live in harmony with nature and led to efforts to restore the health and integrity of the planet’s ecosystems.

Next, it adopted a draft on Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (document A/72/420/Add.9) in a recorded vote of 183 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with 1 abstention (Venezuela).  By that text, the Assembly called for ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.  It also called on Governments to expand the use of renewable energy beyond the power sector to industry, heating and cooling, construction and infrastructure, and in particular the transport sector.

The Assembly then adopted, without a vote, a draft on Combating sand and dust storms (document A/72/420/Add.10), by which it recognized that that meteorological phenomenon had inflicted substantial economic, social and environmental damage on the inhabitants of the world’s arid, semi‑arid and dry subhumid areas, underscoring the need to treat them and take measures to address those challenges.

Next, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, a draft on Implementation of the outcomes of the United Nations Conferences on Human Settlements and on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development and strengthening of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN‑Habitat) (document A/72/421).

It then adopted a text on the Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence (document A/72/422/Add.1) in a recorded vote of 184 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions.  By that draft, the Assembly underlined that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and 2030 Agenda depended on means of implementation, particularly finance, international trade, technology and capacity‑building, calling for sincere and effective follow‑up on global commitments.

The Assembly then took note of the Second Committee’s report on “Promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence”.

Following that, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, a draft on Science, technology and innovation for development (document A/72/422/Add.2), by which it called for strengthened support to those areas, particularly in developing countries.  It would also proclaim 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements to enhance global awareness of and education in the basic sciences.

Next, it adopted, in a recorded vote of 185 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions, a text on Culture and sustainable development (document A/72/422/Add.3).  By that draft, the Assembly encouraged all relevant stakeholders to cooperate in supporting developing country efforts to develop, strengthen and consolidate cultural industries, tourism and related microenterprises.

It then adopted, without a vote, a text on Development cooperation with middle‑income countries (document A/72/422/Add.4), by which the Assembly encouraged shareholders in multilateral development banks to develop a graduation process (from a nation’s lesser developed status) that was sequenced, phased and gradual.

The Assembly then took note of the Second Committee’s report on “Groups of countries in special situations”.

Following that, it turned to a draft on Follow-up to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (document A/72/423/Add.1), adopting it without a vote.  By that text, the Assembly underlined the urgent need to reverse the decline in official development assistance (ODA) to least developed countries, urging nations that had not met commitments to increase their ODA and make concrete efforts towards the ODA targets.

Next, it adopted, without a vote, a draft on Follow-up to the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries (document A/72/423/Add.2).  By that text, the Assembly stressed that cooperation on fundamental transit policies, laws and regulations between landlocked developing countries and their neighbours was crucial for the effective and integrated solution of cross‑border trade and transit transport problems.

The Assembly then took note of the Committee’s report on “Eradication of poverty and other development issues”.

It then adopted, without a vote, a draft on Implementation of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008‑2017) (document A/72/424/Add.1).  By that text, the Assembly emphasized the importance of structural transformation leading to inclusive and sustainable industrialization for employment creation and poverty reduction.

Following that, it adopted, without a vote, a draft on Women in development (document A/72/424/Add.2), by which the Assembly emphasized the need to link policies on economic, social and environmental development to ensure that all people, in particular women and children living in poverty and in vulnerable situations, benefited from inclusive economic growth and development.

The representative of Sudan, explaining his delegation’s position on the “women and development” resolution, said it had joined the consensus.  However, he expressed concern over the wording of some of the resolution’s paragraphs, including false criticisms of particular national legal systems, and disassociated himself from that text.

Next, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, a text on Human resources development (document A/72/424/Add.3), taking note of the report on the same topic.  By that text, it called on the international community to place human resources development at the core of economic and social development as educated, skilled, healthy, capable, productive and adaptable workforces were the foundation for achieving sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and development.

The Assembly then turned to a draft on Operational activities for development of the United Nations system (document A/72/425/Add.1), adopting it without a vote.  By that text, it took note of the Secretary‑General’s report on “Repositioning the United Nations development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda: ensuring a better future for all”.

The Assembly then took note of the Second Committee’s report “Operational activities for development”.

Following that, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, a text on South‑South cooperation for development (document A/72/425/Add.2), by which it stressed that such assistance was not a substitute for, but rather a complement to, North‑South cooperation.  It also called on the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other relevant organizations to assist developing countries in implementing projects of South‑South cooperation.

Next, the Assembly adopted, in a recorded vote of 185 in favour to 1 against (United States), with no abstentions, a draft on Agriculture development, food security and nutrition (document A/72/426).  By that text, it stressed the need to increase sustainable agricultural production globally by improving markets and trading systems as well as increasing responsible public and private investment in sustainable agriculture, land management and rural development.

By further terms, the Assembly stressed that a universal, rules‑based, open, non‑discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system promoted agriculture and rural development in developing countries and contributed to world food security and nutrition.

Following that, it adopted, in a recorded vote of 163 in favour to 6 against (Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, United States), with 11 abstentions, a text on Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources (document A/72/428).  By that draft, the Assembly called on Israel to cease exploitation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Syrian Golan.

Further to the text, the Assembly called on Israel to comply with its obligations under international law and cease all policies and measures aimed at the alteration of the character and status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  It also called on Israel to halt all actions harming the environment, cease destruction of vital infrastructure, remove obstacles to the implementation of critical environmental projects, cease efforts impeding Palestinian development and export of discovered oil and natural gas reserves.

The Assembly then adopted a draft decision to approve the Second Committee’s programme of work for its seventy‑third session.

Finally, it took note of a report on programme planning.

The Assembly then took up a draft resolution titled “A world against violence and violent extremism” (document A/72/L.32).

The representative of Iran, introducing that text, said it was a follow‑up to Assembly resolutions 68/127 and 70/109, both of which had been adopted by consensus.  That unity demonstrated the pressing need to act to combat violent extremism, especially through the principles of tolerance and moderation.  Calling for collective international action in that regard — especially in the wake of the atrocities committed over the last few years by extremist groups in Iraq and Syria, including by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Daesh) — he stressed that “dialogue, moderation and tolerance are the most effective antidote to violent extremism”.  Urging Member States to avoid associating violent extremism with any particular religion or nationality, he said doing so “played right into the terrorists’ hands” and further spread extremist ideology.  Noting that the Assembly could provide a strong platform to help address the roots of that phenomenon, he said the text also reaffirmed measures taken at the international level such as the Assembly’s high‑level 2016 meeting on the topic, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) 2016 conference on youth and the Internet.  It also spotlighted the Secretary‑General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism and requested him to report on the implementation of the present resolution at the Assembly’s seventy‑fourth session.

The Assembly then adopted that draft resolution without a vote.

Speaking following the adoption, the representative of Canada said her delegation strongly condemned all violent extremism, including violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.  The rights of all people must be respected, she stressed, noting that the Secretary‑General’s Plan of Action recognized the important link between social exclusion and violent extremism.  All States — especially the resolution’s main sponsor — should comply with their international obligations to protect human rights.

The representative of Israel said her delegation had joined in the consensus, but voiced concern not with “the message but the messenger”.  Iran, the text’s main sponsor, was in fact the “nerve‑centre” of violent extremism and terrorist incitement around the globe, as well as its main sponsor.  Iran’s proxies butchered innocent people and violated human rights, she said, adding that members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Iran were hanged from cranes, journalists were arrested, girls as young as 12 were married off and prisoners were tortured.  In Syria, Iran’s continued support for the Assad regime had allowed it to use chemical weapons against its own people, and next door in Lebanon it had helped Hizbullah increase its weapons arsenal.  With the adoption of the present text, it was critical for the international community to focus on Iran’s own actions, she stressed, noting that that country had already violated the very resolution it was sponsoring.

The representative of Saudi Arabia said his country had joined consensus on the resolution based on its belief in a comprehensive effort to combat violence and extremism.  It supported all efforts aimed at fighting violent extremism, but must address contradictions concerning security.  It was clear that Iran, the sponsor of the resolution, was also the main sponsor of violence and violent extremism across the world.  Iran had worked to destroy Yemen and was continuing to do so through violations of international law.  Several of its militias had wreaked havoc in Syria and Lebanon, and it was supporting extremist groups with weapons and other prohibited items.  He condemned Iranian support for those groups, stressing the need to prevent and counter all forms of violent extremism.

The representative of the United States noted that the Assembly had on 19 December adopted a resolution condemning Iran for continuing to violate international law and voicing concern over the targeting of minority religious communities.  Yet, 24 hours later, Iran was sponsoring a resolution against violence and extremism.  It had often acted in clear violation of its international obligations, which ran counter to the spirit of the resolution.  Her country had joined consensus on the resolution, as it believed in a comprehensive effort to counter extremism.  While Iran urged countries to unite against violence, its Government actively fomented violence across the Middle East.  Its support for Hizbullah had expanded the group’s arsenal, directly challenging Lebanese sovereignty and threatening Israel.  Iran abused its own people, supported political opponents of other Member States and imprisoned journalists and tourists on trumped up charges.

The representative of the Russian Federation said her country had joined consensus, as it believed in the resolution’s potential.  It viewed extremism as separate from terrorism, although it was a breeding ground for it.  Efforts to counter violent extremism must be based on international law and the United Nations Charter.  That was important when vague terms were being used to put forth dubious concepts.  She noted that extremist propaganda could, without violence, lead to undermining of the rule of law, destabilization of society and mass violations of human rights.

The representative of the European Union delegation rejected any form of discrimination, including on the grounds of sex, race, colour, language, genetic features, religion, membership in a minority group or sexual orientation or any other.  All nations must respect international human rights, promote good governance and uphold the rule of law.  She therefore urged all States — including the resolution’s main sponsor — to respect the rights of all their people, including ethnic, sexual and religious minorities.

Right of Reply

Speaking in exercise of the right of reply, the representative of Iran responded to the statement delivered by the delegate of the “Israeli regime”, who had levied baseless allegations and lies against his country.  Israel’s anger over the resolution adopted today was understandable, as it was an occupying entity that had created an apartheid system in the territories it controlled.  The representative of Israel had clearly deemed the resolution to be “against itself”, he said, noting that it pursued one of the most extreme policies in the modern world and denied the people living under its occupation their most basic rights.  In contrast, Iran had done everything in its power to combat violent extremism.

Responding to the representative of the United States, he said that country had for almost a year pursued a new policy which included levying baseless allegations and lies against Iran.  It was also working to advance the interests of the Israeli regime in the Middle East and was taking advantage of some regional countries by creating a “local bogeyman”.  It was not a coincidence that the United States had gone into high gear in its false allegations against Iran following the massive condemnation it received on its decision to recognize Al‑Quds [Jerusalem] as Israel’s capital.  The United States Government’s regime change project inflicted severe suffering across the Middle East, he said, adding that that country supported, armed and trained known terrorist groups in Syria.  The United States’ own past aggressions and interventions in the region had created fertile ground for recruitment by those advocating the violent takfirist ideology.

Turning to the representative of Saudi Arabia, he said that that country was a main sponsor of violent extremism worldwide, having lavishly financed the export of its fanatical ideology to poorer nations over the last three decades.  Saudi Arabia remained a critical support base for Al‑Qaida, the Taliban and other terrorist groups, and it supported any group that would fight the Government in Syria.  Noting that ISIL/Daesh was a product of Saudi support and financing, he said that country’s ideology propagated hatred and sought to spread it abroad.

2388139,"USAID in Afghanistan: Challenges and Successes BY: William Hammink

For nearly sixteen years in Afghanistan, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has sought to deliver effective development results in a war zone. Its most extensive program since Vietnam, the effort has pushed the agency well beyond its traditional boundary of delivering development aid. This report—which is based on field experience in Afghanistan, interviews, and a review of retrospective analyses—examines the challenges of working amid conflict while, despite generous funding, subject to shifting political and security objectives and high expectations. Its recommendations are specific and targeted to future endeavors in similar environments around the world. 

**Summary**

- The demands on USAID in Afghanistan since 2002 have pushed it well outside its traditional boundaries.

- Expectations were high that USAID would provide development to match the major U.S. military effort: delivering enduring development results in a war zone and billions of dollars of assistance in the face of ever-changing priorities and urgency in a country torn apart by decades of civil war.
Running throughout have been trade-offs, and at times tension between short-term security and political objectives, using quick-response actions and longer-term development efforts needed to strengthen institutions, support economic growth, reconstruct destroyed infrastructure and build a state after decades of civil war.

- Short-term stabilization programs or long-term development programs in areas with active ongoing conflict have had limited enduring impact. Targeted humanitarian assistance has had more impact.
Clarity is essential for short-term, quick-impact, quick-response programs, especially in regard to related timelines, sustainability issues, risks, the impact of exogenous events on stability, governance and “hearts and minds” programs, and the broader strategic policy requirements to achieve stated U.S. political and security objectives. Keeping expectations reasonable, especially in complex environments, is imperative.

- As much as possible in a war zone situation, proven development principles—such as local systems, sustainability, evidence-based design and implementation, strong monitoring and evaluation, and country ownership—need to be maintained. Requisite analyses up front are essential, as is focus on institutions and local capacity.

**About the Report**

This Special Report examines the challenges the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) encountered while working in a war zone, despite generous funding, subject to high expectations for long-term institutional development results and constantly shifting U.S. short-term political and security objectives. Based on field experience in Afghanistan, interviews with key practitioners, and a review of retrospective analyses, the report was drafted while the author was an interagency professional in residence at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP). The report reflects the author’s viewpoints and opinions and not those of USAID or USIP.

**TRANSCRIPT**

**MEDIA STAKEOUT FOLLOWING SRSG TADAMICHI YAMAMOTO’S BRIEFING TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL**

**New York – 21 December 2017**

**(near verbatim)**

* * *

**Participants:**

- UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto Tadamichi 

**Yamamoto:** Good afternoon. I just finished the meeting on Afghanistan. In the meeting today, there were clear focuses, one on elections and one on peace efforts. On elections, there was a clear consensus that the timeline of the elections is still met, and that their conduct be credible and transparent. The second focus was on peace efforts. There is going to be a meeting, the Kabul Process on Peace and Reconciliation, on 1 February. A lot of expectation was made on that particular meeting, particularly in terms of consolidating international efforts. On both issues of elections and peace and reconciliation, it was stressed that an Afghan lead and an Afghan ownership are critical. These were I think the main points of the meeting today.

**Question:** The international criminal court has made a request to review some of the events in Afghanistan since 2003. What do you think of that? I understand the ICC is separate from the UN, but obviously would have some ramifications in the country. What’s your thought on that?

**Yamamoto:** They have work to conduct, and the United Nations has a general understanding that we would work with them. So we’ll see how it goes. It just started, and we have to look how it goes.

**Question:** What could you say about a possible Security Council trip to Afghanistan?

**Yamamoto:** If it takes place, I think it’s a great thing. It’s one of those things which I think has to be held very confidentially.

**Question:** What is the progress in terms of getting the Taliban into the peace process?

**Yamamoto:** Well, not much actually. And I think that’s one of the things that the Kabul Process, and efforts leading up to that, will have to address. It is very important that the Taliban comes to the table, and all efforts have to be made.

**Question:** What is the reason for their hesitation in joining the process?

**Yamamoto:** I think that is very well known. They have their own position as to how they want to join the peace efforts, which is that they don’t want to have direct negotiation with the Afghan government at the moment, but I think that this is what we are trying to make them understand, that this is actually very important.",4599,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
2388049,"Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on Syria, 21 December 2017 The EU welcomes the adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 2393 which renews the authorization of the cross-border humanitarian operations into Syria. These are desperately needed by 3 million people who still cannot be reached by any other means. The EU is also deeply concerned by the continued lack of humanitarian access to the 13.1 million people in need of assistance throughout Syria, including over 1.3 million living in siege-like conditions.  

In Syria, the fighting is far from over. The EU strongly condemns the continued systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights as well as recent attacks and the continued siege of Eastern Ghouta. We urge the Syrian regime to allow immediate, sustained and unhindered access for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. The regime's persistent obstacles to humanitarian aid and medical evacuations in Eastern Ghouta are a blatant violation of international humanitarian law and several UN Security Council Resolutions.  

The EU firmly believes only a credible political solution in line with UNSCR 2254 and the 2012 Geneva Communique will end the war and ensure the sustainable stability of Syria. In this context, the EU reiterates that it will be ready to assist in the reconstruction of Syria only when a comprehensive, genuine and inclusive political transition, negotiated by the Syrian parties in the conflict on the basis of UNSCR 2254 and the Geneva Communique, is firmly under way.  

The EU commends the Syrian Negotiation Commission's constructive and united engagement in the last round of the Geneva talks. It deplores, however, the Syrian regime's continued obstruction of talks, which has prevented progress. Therefore, the EU calls upon the regime's allies, notably Russia, to ensure that the Syrian regime fully engages in this UNSC-mandated process.  

In order to reach that aim the EU reaffirms the primacy of the UN-led Geneva process and its full support for the work of the UN Special Envoy. The EU will continue to support this process including through organising the second Brussels Conference on the ""Future of Syria and the region"" that will take place in spring 2018.

On the evening of 19 December, while in government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk), the SMM heard 80 explosions (40 assessed as outgoing rounds of multiple launch rocket systems (BM-21 Grad, 122mm) 2km north-east, ten as outgoing artillery rounds 5km north-west, four as outgoing infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) (BMP-1) cannon (73mm) rounds 8-10km south-west, one as an outgoing mortar round 5-6km south-east, 15 as outgoing rounds 6-10km east and the remainder undetermined 8-10km south-west) as well as heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire 5-10km at directions ranging from east to south-west.

On the evening of 19 December, while in “DPR”-controlled Debaltseve (58km north-east of Donetsk) for about five hours, the SMM heard 77 undetermined explosions 7-10km west-north-west. During the day on 20 December, while at the same location, the SMM heard an undetermined explosion 5-7km south-west and over 50 shots and bursts of small-arms fire 3-7km north-west.

During the day on 20 December, positioned at the railway station in “DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata (16km north-east of Donetsk) for about five hours, the SMM heard about 210 undetermined explosions and about 270 shots and bursts of heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire 2-5km at directions ranging from west-south-west to north-north-west, as well as small-arms fire 1-3km east.

Positioned at the Donetsk central railway station (6km north-west of “DPR”-controlled Donetsk city centre) for about an hour, the SMM heard 18 undetermined explosions and heard and saw 12 tracer rounds in flight from west to east, all 2-5km west and north-west (assessed as fired from the southern edge of government-controlled Pisky (11km north-west of Donetsk) toward “DPR”-controlled Vesele (9km north-west of Donetsk)), as well as shots and bursts of small-arms fire 2-4km at directions ranging from west to north-east.

Positioned 1km north of “DPR”-controlled Zaichenko (26km north-east of Mariupol) for about an hour, the SMM heard 30 explosions (two assessed as outgoing and the remainder undetermined) as well as about 70 shots and bursts of heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire, all at unknown distances at south-south-west, south-west and west.

Positioned in government-controlled Novoluhanske (53km north-east of Donetsk) for about four hours, the SMM heard ten undetermined explosions 6-8km south-west.

In Luhansk region, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations, including 40 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 950 explosions).

Positioned in “LPR”-controlled Kruhlyk (31km south-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard ten explosions assessed as outgoing tank rounds 5km south-east, assessed as part of a live-fire exercise.

The SMM continued to follow up on the withdrawal of Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) from the territory of Ukraine. (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.) Positioned in “DPR”-controlled Oleksandrivka (20km south-west of Donetsk), an “emergency service” member and another unarmed “DPR” member told the SMM that they would undertake the same duties as the previous Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the JCCC. Positioned in government-controlled Bohdanivka (41km south-west of Donetsk), the SMM noted that no JCCC officers were present, only a Ukrainian Armed Forces officer.

The SMM followed up on reports of civilian casualties. At the central hospital in “DPR”-controlled Snizhne (72km east of Donetsk), medical staff told the SMM that on 15 December, a man (aged 67) had been killed after having mishandled an explosive device while at his house at 16/2 Hryboiedova Street in Snizhne. The SMM was shown the medical certificate which described the cause of death as traumatic shock and multiple wounds to internal abdominal organs from a blast. The SMM visited 16/2 Hryboiedova Street in Snizhne and saw a broken kitchen window, shattered glass and a wooden bar blocking off the kitchen door. At 14 Hryboiedova Street, the SMM spoke with the deceased man’s neighbour (a woman in her thirties), who told the SMM she had heard an explosion at around 12:00 on 15 December from the direction of her neighbour’s house and later had seen an ambulance as well as “emergency service” members and “police” arrive at his home.

At the regional clinical hospital in Kharkiv, medical staff told the SMM that a female resident of Novoluhanske (aged 71) had been transferred there from a hospital in government-controlled Bakhmut (formerly Artemivsk, 67km north of Donetsk) on 18 December. Medical staff added that she had lost her right eye due to shrapnel wounds she had sustained; she had undergone an operation and her condition was stable. (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

The SMM followed up on reports of damage to civilian properties in residential areas caused by shelling. On 19 December, in Novoluhanske, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted recent shelling damage to roofs and walls of 36 houses, an apartment block and a public building. The UAV also spotted damage to a kindergarten and to a school: the kindergarten had damage to one side of its roof, where the entry point of a shell was visible, and shattered debris around it while the school had damage to a 4m section of the roof as well as debris in the courtyard. Next to the school, the UAV spotted a fire truck and a truck with an extended telescopic platform which appeared to be working on the school’s roof. The UAV also spotted about 20 fresh craters in the village assessed to have been caused by artillery and mortar rounds: one of the craters was 1m from an agricultural shed and another was seen on the side of a road next to two stationary military-type trucks. Additional armoured combat vehicles (ACV), mines and indications of military-type presence were also spotted in the village (see below). The SMM confirmed civilian casualties from Novoluhanske on 19 December. (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

During the day on 20 December at about 12:30, positioned at the Prince Ihor monument 1km south-east of the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge (15km north-east of Luhansk), the SMM heard an explosion assessed as an outgoing mortar (82mm) round 250m north (assessed as outside the disengagement area). At around the same time, the SMM saw a man in military-style clothes in a firing position on the southern edge of the disengagement area.

While on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard ten shots of heavy-machine-gun fire 5km south (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area).

Positioned 2km east-north-east of Bohdanivka, the SMM heard five undetermined explosions at unknown distances south-south-west and small-arms fire at unknown distances east (all assessed as outside the Petrivske disengagement area).

On the evening of 18 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded an undetermined explosion 4-6km east-north-east and two undetermined explosions 4-9km south-east (all assessed as outside the disengagement area). On 20 December, positioned in Zolote, the SMM saw that the vegetation along both sides of the road leading to Pervomaisk had not been cleared. 

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted, on 13 December, a probable mortar (120mm) 2.6km east of a military camp about 2km north of Travneve. (See SMM Daily Report 7 December 2017.)

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a government-controlled area, the SMM saw a tank (T-72) being transported on a truck near Stepanivka (54km north of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in areas outside of government control, the SMM saw three stationary tanks (T-64) near Myrne and ten stationary tanks near Kruhlyk.

The SMM revisited a permanent storage site in an area outside government control in Luhansk region, whose location was beyond the respective withdrawal lines, and noted that one tank (T-64) was again missing.

The SMM observed ACVs,[3] mines and indications of military presence in the security zone. In an area outside of government control, the SMM saw a military-type engineering vehicle digging a trench (20m long and 2m deep) 5m south of the eastern side of a junction on road T0519 near Vedenske (33km north-east of Mariupol). On the western side of the same junction, the SMM saw two recently excavated firing positions, assessed to be for IFVs.

An SMM mid-range UAV, on 13 December, spotted nine anti-tank mines (TM-62) in a trench on the southern street in Travneve, a stationary military-type truck (GAZ-66) carrying a probable generator parked next to a yard on the main street in the village and a stationary ambulance in the eastern part of the village. Additionally, on 13 December, the SMM heard that a power company had brought two generators to the village. (See SMM Daily Report 15 December 2017.) A series of trenches on the southern street in the village emanating from residential houses and six craters assessed to have been caused by artillery and mortar rounds were spotted. On the road east of Travneve toward Dolomitne (53km north-east of Donetsk), the UAV spotted two trenches, two rows of anti-tank mines (TM-62) (18 mines in total) as well as two rows of probable anti-tanks mines in a field north of the road. Further east along the same road, two sets of new trenches were spotted as well as a crater.

In Dolomitne, on 13 December, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted trenches under the railway tracks, recently dug trenches, vehicle revetments, weapon impacts to the roof of a warehouse building and shelling damage to the roof of another nearby building, all in the southern part of the village. On the road leading north of the village, the UAV spotted two rows of anti-tank mines (TM-62) – one with seven mines and the other with nine – laid across the road, and a total of five mines on either side of the road. At the northern edge of the village, several trenches were spotted cutting across the road, assessed as rendering it impassable for wheeled vehicles. About 300m north of the trenches, the UAV spotted ten anti-tank mines that had been laid across the road and, 300-400m further north, it spotted a trench, a series of tyres forming a roadblock and two IFVs (BMP-1). East of the road block, the UAV spotted an extensive position and, further north along the road, it spotted an IFV (BMP-1), an armoured personnel carrier (APC) (Kozak-variant), several trenches and vehicle revetments.

In “DPR”-controlled Holmivskyi (49km north-east of Donetsk), on 13 December, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted trenches and firing positions north of the village. (See SMM Daily Report 7 December 2017.)

In Novoluhanske, on 19 December, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted trenches, vehicle revetments and firing positions around the perimeter and inside an agricultural area, as well as an IFV (BMP-1). In the village, the UAV spotted an APC (BTR-variant), a reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-variant) and eight military-type trucks and, close to the damaged school (see above), the UAV spotted two APCs (BTR-variant and Saxon) and six military-type trucks (Ural and Kamaz). In a field south-west of Novoluhanske, the UAV spotted at least 56 anti-tank mines.

The SMM visited two border areas outside government control. At the border crossing point near Izvaryne (52km south-east of Luhansk), during one hour, the SMM saw ten cars (two with “LPR” plates), two buses and about 120 pedestrians (60 per cent men, aged 45-65 and 40 per cent women, aged 25-60) exiting Ukraine and three covered cargo trucks, two buses and 60 pedestrians (60 per cent women and 40 per cent men, aged 40-60) entering Ukraine.

At a border crossing point near Voznesenivka (formerly Chervonopartyzansk, 65km south-east of Luhansk), during one hour, the SMM saw 13 cars, two buses and 28 pedestrians (16 men and 12 women, aged 30-70) exiting Ukraine and 25 cars, a bus and four pedestrians (two men and two women, aged 30-35) entering Ukraine.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Dnipro, Chernivtsi and Kyiv.

*Restrictions of SMM’s freedom of movement or other impediments to fulfilment of its mandate

The SMM’s monitoring and freedom of movement are restricted by security hazards and threats, including risks posed by mines, unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other impediments – which vary from day to day. The SMM’s mandate provides for safe and secure access throughout Ukraine. All signatories of the Package of Measures have agreed on the need for this safe and secure access, that restriction of the SMM’s freedom of movement constitutes a violation, and on the need for rapid response to these violations. They have also agreed that the JCCC should contribute to such response and co-ordinate mine clearance. Nonetheless, the armed formations in parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions frequently deny the SMM access to areas adjacent to Ukraine’s border outside control of the Government, citing orders to do so. (See, for example, SMM Daily Report 2 December 2017.) The SMM’s operations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions remained restricted following the fatal incident of 23 April near Pryshyb; these restrictions continued to limit the Mission’s observations.

Denial of access:

Related to disengagement areas and mines/UXO:

The SMM was prevented from accessing secondary roads south of the Zolote disengagement area due to the possible presence of mines and UXO. Armed “LPR” members positioned on the southern side of the Zolote disengagement area told the SMM that no demining had taken place during the previous 24 hours. The SMM did not consider it safe to proceed.
The SMM was prevented from accessing secondary roads in the Zolote disengagement area due to the possible presence of mines and UXO. Ukrainian Armed Forces officers of the JCCC at a checkpoint on the northern side of the Zolote disengagement area told the SMM that no demining had taken place during the previous 24 hours. The SMM did not consider it safe to proceed and informed the JCCC.
The SMM was prevented from accessing parts of the Stanytsia Luhanska disengagement area, with the exception of the main road, due to the possible presence of mines and UXO. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the JCCC told the SMM that no de-mining had taken place during the previous 24 hours. The SMM did not consider it safe to proceed and informed the JCCC.
The SMM could not travel across the bridge in government-controlled Shchastia due to the presence of mines. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the JCCC said there were mines on the road south of the bridge. The SMM informed the JCCC.

2387999,"UN envoy calls for peace agreement to stop ‘ongoing suffering of millions of Afghans **NEW YORK - **As this calendar year closes, we are still left to tackle the issue that concerns us most in Afghanistan, a convincing peace process to end the 40 years of conflict, said the UN Secretary-General’s special Representative for Afghanistan at United Nations headquarters today.

“One year ago in this Council, I called upon all Afghans to come together and find ways to build their own joint future,” said Tadamichi Yamamoto, who is also head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).  “We must use the upcoming winter months, when conflict levels tend to decrease, to advance on this issue before the cycle of violence is renewed next spring.”

The UN envoy described the 1 February 2018 Kabul Process meeting, where the Government of Afghanistan is expected to present its strategic concept for reaching a political settlement with the armed opposition, as an opportunity that must not be missed.

“I once again call on the Taliban to express a clear willingness to begin negotiations towards a political settlement, and to start the initial dialogue,” he said, calling attention to the increased consultations among the countries in the region about securing peace in Afghanistan.

Another issue Yamamoto highlighted to the Security Council during the debate on the Secretary-General’s latest report on the situation in Afghanistan is the holding of parliamentary elections next year, followed by presidential elections in April 2019.

“The holding of timely, credible, and accepted elections is indispensable to maintaining the constitutional order and trust in the representative system of government,” he said, underlining that security and women’s political participation are vitally important to the credibility of the elections.

In addition to these issues, Yamamoto outlined issues around civilian casualties, Afghanistan’s economy and its regional relationships. “I am particularly concerned about recent reports of increased military activities between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” he said, calling on Afghanistan and Pakistan to find ways of collaborating more effectively to address the issues that affect the populations of both countries.

In closing, the UN envoy said that the United Nations is ready to do whatever it can in the interest of a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan. “I truly hope that empathy for the ongoing suffering of millions of Afghans will move us all to make the efforts necessary to achieve peace and realize the important opportunities that lie beyond a much needed peace agreement,” he said.

2393439,"Venezuela Situation Update, November 2017 The total number of Venezuelans in Colombia has more than doubled in less than four months, reaching 660,000 individuals, end-November, up from 300,000 in June.

Between January and October 2017 over 100.000 Venezuelan nationals have entered Peru through the northern entry point in Tumbes, according to authorities.

In Brazil 15,645 Venezuelans have lodged asylum claims in 2017, 1,680 Temporary Residence Permits have been granted and a total of 30,000 are estimated to live in the country.

**POPULATION OF CONCERN** 

- In November the movements from Venezuela to Colombia continued to grow, according to government figures that show net arrivals from Venezuelans reached 4,000 people per day (up from 3,500 in October), and 2,500 Colombian returnees per day. Colombian authorities also reported that some 200,000 have crossed into Ecuador. 

- Over 1 million Venezuelans have now registered for the Border Mobility Card (TMF) in Colombia. 

- In Peru 19,000 Venezuelans have applied for the Temporary Permanence Permit (PTP), Peruvian authorities estimate. Since August 4,000 PTPs have been issued out of that total. 

- At least 60,000 Venezuelans are estimated to be residing in the Southern Caribbean. 

- In Brazil some 15,000 of all Venezuelan asylum-claims have been lodged in Roraima border state since 2014, 2,500 in Amazonas state and some 590 in Sao Paulo.

**CONTEXT INFORMATION**

Over one million Venezuelans have left their country, according to host Government figures. Over 106,000 have sought asylum since 2014, more than half in 2017. Some 190,000 have also applied for alternative legal status across the region. They claim they are leaving for a variety of reasons, including threats by armed groups; fear of being targeted on account of their political opinion, real or perceived; insecurity and violence; lack of food, medicine and access to essential social services, as well as loss of income.

UNHCR has also identified hundreds of indigenous people crossing the borders, primarily into Colombia and Brazil. These groups sometimes travel long distances by land and have shown to be highly vulnerable as they do not have the financial resources to buy food or shelter. Additional support has been provided to them.

While the dialogue between the Government and the opposition coalition has restarted in the Dominican Republic, people continue to steadily leave the country. The socio-economic situation increasingly deteriorates and inflation has made it extremely difficult to access food, medicine, basic products and services. Reports from international organizations state that there is a considerable number of people with chronic malnutrition in the country, as well as a shortage of medicine. As a result of the strained resources, insecurity has also been increasing and having a rising impact on peoples’ lives.

**Operational Context**

**Brazil**

- The Government of Roraima has declared a state of social emergency due to the “intense, unlimited and disorderly flow of Venezuelans without means or conditions to sustain themselves” that arrive from Venezuela. Local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to provide an adequate security and health response, as well as to implement the recent government resolution that establishes standard operation procedures for the protection of unaccompanied and separated children, based on the recommendations by UNHCR.

- Among the reasons given by the Warao for leaving Venezuela, is that the government’s support to indigenous communities in the country has ceased. They claim that there are no available schools, health centres or services. Water distribution, usually their only source of potable water, has allegedly also stopped. The Warao also stated that they suffered discrimination in the access to ID- documents, which could help explain the considerable amount of Warao without identification arriving in Brazil.

- The Warao continue to move inward, confirming their intent to stay. Over 200 Warao are living in Pará state. The majority is living on the streets, while some 70 people are staying in a rural school set up as a temporary shelter by the Municipality. Following UNHCR’s counsel, Amazonas and Pará authorities created a formal communication channel to exchange experiences and lessons learned.

**Colombia**

- Armed groups activities at the Colombian-Venezuela border, incursions by the Venezuelan military into Colombia, confrontations between governments and the lack of capacity to control the actions of armed actors on both sides of the border are increasing risks for persons of concern in these areas. UNHCR continues to monitor the reports of violence at the border.

- In October, a pamphlet was distributed in Arauca by the “Araucan Social Cleansing Group”, accusing Venezuelan men of selling drugs to children and committing crimes and Venezuelan women of being prostitutes, and called for them to go back to Venezuela or face assassination.

- Colombian authorities are concerned about the spread of diseases including malaria, measles, diphtheria and tuberculosis in reception areas. They state that due to a lack of health access in Venezuela, arrivals are boosting transmission rates. More than 19,000 Venezuelans have received emergency treatment in Colombia, increasing pressure on local services. The Government is working with the Red Cross and WHO/PAHO to increase services, and UNHCR is advocating to ensure a protection-sensitive approach.

- The Special Stay Permit (PEP) application deadline expired on 31 October. Over 67,000 Venezuelans applied for the permit, which allows them to regularize their status, work and access basic services for up to two years in Colombia. UNHCR is advocating for this measure to be extended to ensure that legal pathways remain open, as is the case in other countries in the region.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2393344,"Mine Action and Confidence-Building: Harnessing Trust for Conflict Prevention in Colombia _Adriana Erthal Abdenur, in San Vicente del Caguán, Caquetá, Colombia_

Christmas preparations are in full swing at the church offices in San Vicente del Caguán, in the department of Caquetá.  Groups of children sit cross-legged on the patio, cutting stars out of shiny construction paper and hanging ornaments on the bushes.  In a small meeting room, I sit down to speak with Sonia (not her real name), one of the community leaders for mine action.

Sonia is young, but—like San Vicente as a whole—exhausted by war.  In the early 2000s, San Vicente became the epicenter of a [failed peace process](http://centromemoria.gov.co/proceso-de-paz-del-caguan/)between the FARC and the government, in which the creation of a cease-fire zone allowed the guerrilla to regroup.  To stop the Army operations in the area, the guerrilla planted hundreds of anti-personnel mines around the town and its surrounding fields.  The area remains one of the most intensely contaminated areas of Colombia (itself among the countries with the highest number of landmines and explosive remnants of war, ERW). Coming into San Vicente, I had seen the demining operations by the side of the road, with Army specialists in full protective gear perched tensely over small squares of soil, patiently combing the soil for casings.   My local guide had pointed at the dense overgrowth covering vast fields–fertile land left fallow due to the suspicion there are still landmines.

Since the final agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC was signed, in December 2016, demining efforts have intensified in this part of Colombia, with [the Army and eight agencies](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/municipios-asignados.aspx) working in priority areas.  Yet accidents continue to happen.  The day before my visit with Sonia, a farmer had one of his legs blown off under the knee when he stepped on a mine in a nearby field.  “He was airlifted by the Army,” says Sonia, noting that his community just recently had been identified for mine action.

Sonia recounts the successes, but also mentions the need to build confidence.  The government broadcasts images of villagers playing football matches on decontaminated fields, but in reality the locals won’t step on that land until they have tested it the old-fashioned way: by sending their cattle to graze on it.“  I ask Sonia whether she herself would walk across one of the demined fields. She pauses. “No.”

When asked why, she reminds me that decontaminated land is said to be free of suspicion of mines, rather than free of mines, and that there is still work to be done on build the local population’s confidence in the process. The impact of mines/ERW is predicated not only on the destructive, even lethal capacity of the explosives, but also on the more generalized fear that vital areas may be contaminated, which prevent entire communities from cultivating land, building essential infrastructure, or accessing vital resources. While it takes little effort to spread fear through mines, [substantial investment is required in trust and confidence-building](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12096848) to minimize that fear.

Yet peace process stakeholders and peacebuilders can also leverage this link between mines and trust to create new dialogue spaces, both during peace talks and during their implementation. Demining, in other words, can present unique opportunities for confidence building among warring parties, in part because mine clearance is often needed in order to implement a local ceasefire or other localized actions even during negotiations. In the FARC process, for instance, demining became the first bilateral point in de-escalation, in order to implement a local cease-fire.   Demining thus required that the Colombian military and the FARC guerrillas collaborate directly, setting a precedent for further cooperation.   Demining, in fact, became one of the main topics around which the agreements were organized, and [is the object of an entire agreement](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/acuerdo/Paginas/Acuerdo-sobre-limpieza-y-descontaminacion.aspx).

After the final agreement was signed, in December 2017, humanitarian mine action (HMA) was among the immediate priorities. A body was set up to [issue a strategy](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/Desminado-Humanitario.aspx) and guidelines following international standards, and the Colombian demining oversight body began working with eight demining agencies (as well as the Organization for American States) to survey, map, and demine vast priority areas.

For locals in the countryside—the areas most directly affected by the conflict—one major trust issue relates to the effectiveness of demining, especially when different types of artifacts are buried at different depths. But trust also implies the credibility of institutions, from the agencies to the government bodies overseeing them. In turn, attaining this confidence requires building an ongoing relationship with local actors, at both individual and institutional levels. As in many other contexts, demining agencies working in Colombia carry out non-technical surveys that include consultations with local communities, and that incorporate locals—including women—into their teams.  Demining agencies are also required to establish an _enlace_—a key person that links the agency and the community and that facilitates the flow of information in both directions. When properly established and maintained, these channels allow for the community to voice concerns from beginning to end of process.

Equally important are the level and capacity of community’s own proactive involvement in the process.  In parts of Colombia, local and regional groups have become proactive in mine action, especially in awareness-raising efforts and in identifying demands and concerns.  This participation allows communities to become familiar with the modus operandi of different agencies. Ideally, it can also create communication channels across communities on the demining process, helping to identify challenges and share solutions.

However, there is still work to be done. In this part of Colombia, community leaders complain that there are not enough _enlaces_.  This gap undercuts the exchange of information, which is vital not only to the agencies (which rely in part on popular knowledge to identify mined areas) but also to the communities, who continue to suffer casualties and live in fear even as mine action efforts are undertaken elsewhere.  In some instances, agencies can undermine trust.  Near her hometown, notes Sonia, one agency has divulged who planted the explosives. “This information can reignite resentment among groups,” she notes. “We need to demine without focusing on who did what, otherwise it becomes hard to break the cycle of distrust and resentment.”

Matching agencies to local communities can also be part of this process.  The agreement with the FARC establishes that [ex-combatants also participate in demining](http://caracol.com.co/radio/2017/02/04/nacional/1486166835_366877.html). Sonia assures me that there are communities in Caquetá that in fact would prefer to have the ex-combatants decontaminating their land.  “They know one another,” she says. “And you can’t demine without trust.”

2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2393194,"Solar power brings light to Congolese refugees in Angola **LOUVA, Angola** – Since the outbreak of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kasai region earlier this year, nearly 35,000 refugees have poured into Angola’s Lunda Norte Province.

The population is highly vulnerable. Some 75 per cent of refugees from Kasai are women and children, according to UN reports. Many refugees have reported witnessing mass killings, rape and other human rights abuses during their flight from conflict.

Ester, 25, recounted the frenzy of her departure. “It was the day when the war arrived to our village. They were killing people. I was not able to take anything with me, only my children,” she said.

Humanitarian groups are working to relocate many of the refugees from the Cacanda reception centre to a new settlement in Lóvua.

The new location allows the refugees to have some privacy and space for farming, but it is not connected to an electrical grid, so the refugees are left in total darkness when the sun sets – a problem for their safety and security.

Ester’s family recently moved into the settlement. “We are living in the bush. I do not have any lamps, and no light. It makes me feel afraid,” she said. “There is, for example, no light for us to be able to go to the toilet during night.” 

**Darkness poses risks**

Around the world, women and girls report being threatened or assaulted when leaving home at night to relieve themselves or manage their menstrual hygiene. These risks are elevated in crisis settings, when social safety nets, law enforcement and other protection mechanisms break down.

Darkness poses other risks as well. Women who go into labour at night, for example, may have trouble getting to clinics or being properly treated without a reliable light source.

“Light is important to help maintain the safety and rights of women and adolescents at night,” said Florbela Fernandes, UNFPA’s representative in Angola.

**Portable sunshine**

UNFPA is working with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to provide 50 solar-powered units to community centres, medical facilities and other communal spaces in the Lóvua refugee settlement. 

The units, donated by Panasonic, consist of a solar panel, three LED lamps, and a rechargeable battery that can also be used to charge mobile phones.

“We hope these solar lamps can be installed in public facilities to be able to extend the services and provide light in the dark,” said Yuzo Kitamoto, deputy representative for the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Angola, after a visit to Lóvua in December.

Women and girls arriving in Lóvua are also receiving solar-powered torches, part of the dignity kits that are a standard part of UNFPA’s humanitarian response. Some 2,000 dignity kits – which contain hygiene items such as soap, underwear and sanitary napkins – are being handed out, with more on the way. 

UNFPA is additionally partnering with the UN Refugee Agency to deliver solar street lights to the settlement. And in partnership with Médicos del Mundo, UNFPA has set up women-friendly spaces, where women and girls can rest, socialize, and learn where to receive reproductive health services and help for survivors of gender-based violence.

As for Ester, she is determined to move forward. “I hope for a good life with my family here in Angola,” she said. “I am too afraid to return now.”

2393139,"Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of 19:30, 25 December 2017 **This report is for the media and the general public.**

Following the [recommitment to cease fire](https://reliefweb.int/node/2390589), the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations in Donetsk region and a similar number of ceasefire violations in Luhansk region between the evenings of 22 and 23 December compared with the previous reporting period. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations in Donetsk region compared with the previous 24 hours and no ceasefire violations in Luhansk region. The SMM recorded more ceasefire violations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions between the evenings of 24 and 25 December compared with the previous 24 hours, but fewer compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December. The Mission followed up on reports of a civilian injured along the contact line near Berezove and observed damage to residential areas of Pavlopil and Yasynuvata assessed as caused by shelling. The SMM continued monitoring the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske; it recorded a ceasefire violation inside the Stanytsia Luhanska area. The SMM’s access remained restricted in all three areas and elsewhere, including at two “DPR” weapons storage sites. The Mission observed weapons in violation near Poltavka. The SMM visited five border areas beyond government control. In Kyiv, the SMM monitored four gatherings in the city centre.

In Donetsk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 of December, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations[1], including about 200 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 320 explosions). About 40 per cent of these violations, including about 140 explosions, were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December, mostly in the area between government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk) and “DPR”-controlled Debaltseve (58km north-east of Donetsk). Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations, including fewer explosions (18), compared with the previous 24 hours. Between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, although the SMM recorded more ceasefire violations (including 14 explosions) compared with the previous 24 hours, there were significantly fewer ceasefire violations compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, nine projectiles in flight from west to east and two projectiles from east to west, followed by a total of two undetermined explosions and 42 projectiles (42 from west to east and one from east to west), all 1-3km south.

In Luhansk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 December, the SMM recorded a similar number of ceasefire violations, but more explosions (six) compared with the previous reporting period (no explosions). Almost all ceasefire violations were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded no ceasefire violations; between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, the SMM recorded an explosion and a shot of small-arms fire.

During the day on 23 December, positioned 1km north-west of “LPR”-controlled Depreradivka (65km west of Luhansk), the SMM heard five undetermined explosions and six bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 5-7km north-west.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the south-western edge of “LPR”-controlled Molodizhne (63km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an undetermined explosion at least 5km south-west.

On 23 December, a “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Oleksandrivka (20km south-west of Donetsk) told the SMM that a senior “DPR” member had issued an “order” to all “DPR”‑members of the armed formations to comply with the recommitment to the ceasefire and not to return fire. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the Joint Centre for Control and Co‑operation (JCCC) in Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk) told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire and that Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the area had also been informed. On 24 December, an armed “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Pikuzy (formerly Kominternove, 23km north of Mariupol) told the SMM that “DPR” members in the area were aware of the recommitment to cease fire. In government-controlled Lebedynske (16km north-east of Mariupol), an officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire.

The SMM followed up on media reports of a civilian casualty. On 23 December, a Ukrainian Armed Forces soldier told the SMM that a man (71 years old) had triggered a booby trap while off the paved surface north of a checkpoint near Berezove (31km south-west of Donetsk) on 21 December. A volunteer paramedic, who said he had been working nearby at the time of the incident, told the SMM that the man had gone into the vegetation off the road when he tripped the booby trap, which had left his chest and left leg penetrated by metal fragments. Medical staff at the hospital in government-controlled Volnovakha (53km south of Donetsk), where the man was taken, showed the SMM X-rays which, according to the staff, showed approximately 15-20 fragments embedded in the man’s left leg, hip, and chest.

The SMM observed damage to civilian properties in residential areas. On 23 December, approximately 250m south-east of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street in government-controlled Pavlopil (26km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed a fresh crater, assessed as caused by an artillery shell (122mm) fired from an east-north-easterly direction. The SMM observed power lines cut about 75m south of the crater and saw a piece of shrapnel consistent with an artillery shell lodged in the outer pane of a south-facing window of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street. A resident of the house told the SMM that she had heard a loud explosion south-east of her home shortly after 22:00 on 22 December and immediately thereafter lost power. A resident of another house on the same street also told the SMM that he had lost power to his house shortly after hearing a loud explosion just after 22:00 on 22 December.

At 55 Karla Marksa Street in Yasynuvata, the SMM saw a fresh crater 3m south of the property’s entrance gate. The SMM saw fresh shrapnel marks on the gate, fence and south-facing wall of the house and assessed the impact as caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. The owner of the property (man in his seventies) told the SMM that the impact that caused the crater had occurred at 21:45 on 20 December.

At 51 Karla Marksa Street, the SMM saw two fresh craters 3m south and 7m north of a house, as well as four south-facing windows shattered and the south-facing walls scarred by shrapnel. The north-facing wall of the house was destroyed. The SMM assessed the wall to have been destroyed by the blast wave of the impact north of the house. The SMM assessed the impact to have been caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. One of the house’s residents (man in his seventies) told the SMM that shelling had started at around 22:00 on 20 December and that he, his wife and two minor grandchildren had been inside the house at the time.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 21 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded a projectile in flight from south to north (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area).

On the evening of 22 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded an explosion assessed as an impact of an artillery round about 4km east (assessed as outside the disengagement area). On the morning of 23 December, positioned on the eastern edge of “LPR”-controlled Pervomaisk (58km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an explosion and saw smoke rising assessed as the detonation of unexploded ordnance (UXO) 500-700m south-west and outside the disengagement area.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge (15km north-east of Luhansk), the SMM heard a shot of small-arms fire 500m north-west, assessed as inside the disengagement area.

During the day on 23 December, positioned near the Stanytsia Luhanska and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 24 December, positioned near all three disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 25 December, positioned near the Zolote and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in a government-controlled area, the SMM observed four multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) (BM-21 Grad, 122mm) near Poltavka (54km north-west of Donetsk) on 23 December.

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, the SMM observed a tank (type unknown) loaded on a flatbed truck in Rubizhne (84km north-west of Luhansk) and a surface-to-air missile system (9K33 Osa) in the outskirts of Klynove (68km north-east of Donetsk) on 25 December.

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw noted ten MLRS (BM-21) were missing for the first time 23 December; it also saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm), five towed mortars (2B9 Vasilek, 82mm) (three for the first time) and seven towed howitzers (2A36 Giatsint-B, 152mm) (all seven for the first time) on 24 December. In non-government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1) and noted a mortar (2B11 Sani, 120mm) and 12 towed mortars (PM-38, 120mm) were again missing.

The SMM revisited a permanent storage site in an area outside government control in Donetsk region, whose location was beyond the respective withdrawal lines, and noted that eight tanks (three T-64 and five T-72) were again missing. The SMM was denied access to another permanent storage site in a “DPR”-controlled area as its gates were locked and no one was present to open them.*

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles (ACV) and anti-aircraft guns[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, the SMM saw five infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (BMP-1) near Popasna (69km west of Luhansk) on 22 December; nine IFVs (BMP-1), an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) mounted to a military-type truck, an ACV (type unknown) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM‑1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna, as well as an APC (BTR-70) and an armoured reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk) on 23 December; ten IFVs (BMP-variants), four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (BRM‑1K), a self-propelled anti-aircraft system (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 23mm) and an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23) near Popasna, as well as a combat engineering vehicle (IMR-2) near Bezhynove (45km north-west of Luhansk) on 24 December; and seven IFVs (BMP-variants) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM 1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna on 25 December.

In non-government-controlled areas, the SMM observed an APC (BTR-70) near Petrivske on 24 December.

The SMM continued to observe the presence of mine hazard signs. At a checkpoint at the southern end of “DPR”-controlled Sakhanka (24km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed that two mines signs had been placed on a concrete barrier which had the message “No Passage” written on it in Russian. Although the concrete barrier was on the road, the SMM observed traffic driving around it. In front of the Ukrainian Armed Forces compound northwest of government-controlled Nadezhdynka (61km west of Donetsk), the SMM saw a 30x50cm rectangular wooden sign with a white background and black painted letters with “Danger Mines” written on it in Ukrainian.

The SMM visited five border areas not under government control. On 23 December, during about 40 minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Verkhnoharasymivka (57km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM saw 14 pedestrians exiting Ukraine and six pedestrians entering. On 23 December, during about 30 minutes at the pedestrian border crossing point near Novoborovytsi (79km south of Luhansk), the SMM observed a pedestrian entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about one hour at a border crossing point near Dovzhanske (84km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM observed 20 cars, four buses and nine pedestrians exiting Ukraine, as well as 20 civilian cars (three with “LPR” plates), a bus, a covered cargo truck and 11 pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about 45 minutes at a border crossing point near Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed a covered cargo truck and five cars (two with “DPR” plates) exiting Ukraine, as well as 19 cars (eight with “DPR” plates), two covered cargo trucks with “DPR” plates and two pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about ten minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Ulianivske (61km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed no pedestrians entering or exiting Ukraine.

In Kyiv, the SMM monitored gatherings in the city centre. On 24 December, between 12:00 and 14:00, the SMM saw up to 1,500 people (men and women, mixed ages) gathered at Independence Square. The gathering was held following a call on social media by an ATO veteran critical of the ongoing protest near the Parliament building. (See SMM Daily Report 19 December 2017.) The SMM saw no more than ten police officers near the square. The SMM also saw three other groups of people chanting slogans critical of the Government, including a group of about 25 men (aged 50-60) among the abovementioned crowd and another group of about 20 men (aged 20-40) near the square, and a third group of 25 people (mostly men, aged 20-60) in Shevchenko Park. The Mission saw the third group had marched from the park to Khreshchatyk Street. All gatherings ended without incidents.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro and Chernivtsi.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2393129,"Colombia War-Crime Prisoners Face Past, Plan Future *In a Bogotá military prison, former soldiers encounter conflict resolution as they seek to rebuild lives.*

Tuesday, December 26, 2017 / BY: Aubrey Cox; Maria Antonia Montes  
PUBLICATION TYPE: In the Field  

The prisoners would be arriving soon and Adriana Combita, like a young teacher preparing to greet a new class, was nervous. This was not the first time that Combita, 26, had led a peacebuilding training with soldiers convicted of war-related crimes. But these were senior officers, commanders with master’s degrees, military officials who had lived abroad.

As they entered the classroom on the Puente Aranda military base in central Bogotá, some of the prisoners displayed a wary tension. Others slid into their seats and leaned back, looking relaxed. The 16 men made small talk while scanning the room to see who had shown up. Four of them still wore military fatigues. The rest were dressed in civilian clothing, a sign that the military or national police had severed them from service because of the severity of their crimes. Combita reviewed her agenda and taped diagrams on a white board.

The majority of the prisoners didn’t know what to expect, but they did know why they volunteered to be here: Before long, they will be given the option to tell their stories to a tribunal of magistrates established under the peace [accords](https://www.usip.org/blog/2017/09/colombia-peace-year-life-new-accord-farc) that ended 52 years of war between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC.) This classroom is a place to learn how to tell it.

The tribunal, which could recommend reduced sentences for the prisoners in exchange for the complete truth, forms part of an innovative transitional justice system known as the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP). Its mandate is to investigate and document serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the armed conflict, and to prosecute, judge and sanction the perpetrators of those crimes. The JEP is also responsible for presenting Colombian society with the truth of what happened in the conflict and addressing the rights of victims.  

Its aim is to help reweave Colombia’s social fabric.

**Generation Change**

Using knowledge and skills derived from the U.S. Institute of Peace’s [Generation Change Fellows Program](https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/06/colombian-youth-bolster-peace-accord-new-skills)(GCFP), Combita will help the men reflect on their lives and on how their actions in Colombia’s war affected others. They will learn new strategies to communicate and to engage with people from different backgrounds and experiences through channels other than violence.

Combita, whose direct but caring manner sets up an easy rapport with the prisoners, is a youth leader working on prison projects for the Internal Action Foundation. Before her Generation Change experience, she worked mostly with women prisoners, helping them develop entrepreneurship skills that might allow them to earn a living when they’re released. After participating in a training for Generation Change Fellows in March, Combita met a group of women leading trainings for imprisoned fighters from the FARC and a smaller insurgent group, the National Liberation Army. Inspired by those women, and her Generation Change experience, she decided to change her focus to conflict resolution and peacebuilding.

At the military facilities, she is helping to improve the prisoners’ ability to speak about their experiences in the war and to contribute to the JEP’s goals of truth, justice and reparation—in effect, preparing them for the JEP process. The military has given the program welcome access to its prisons.

This first session of the October 23 training lasts well beyond its scheduled two hours. In one structured exercise, Combita asks the men to reflect on the positive and negative aspects of their lives. For 10 minutes they silently draw “rivers” of their lives with positive and negative shorelines.

Many of the men, who range in age from 18 to the mid-50s, discuss their careers as a positive. Negatives include the armed conflict, the death of family members caused by it and their imprisonment. Most talk about “Dios supremo”—God supreme—as an ally throughout their journey and their families as providing stability throughout their sentences. They say the peace process that ended the conflict and the approval of the JEP are positives that they hope will allow them to tell their truth and feel some sense of release.

In other exercises, they talk about the incidents, people and places that shaped the trajectory of their lives and reflect on the experiences that landed them in prison. The objective is, in part, to [connect](https://www.usip.org/programs/mediation-colombia) to other people in a new, more human way.

“I know that what we’re doing and talking about today will help me in the future,” said one of the ex-soldiers. “I would have liked to have this type of training when I first arrived in prison. It could have helped me understand my colleagues, to help ourselves be better, understand myself and how I got here.”

**FARC and Soldiers**

Combita has already held 16 sessions applying GCFP’s lessons on prejudice awareness and reduction, conflict management and leadership development in prisons for women, [guerrillas](https://www.usip.org/publications/2016/11/gender-and-role-women-colombias-peace-process) and soldiers and police in Cartagena, Cali, and two other facilities in Bogotá.

Combita developed the prison engagements to help prepare the inmates for the JEP, considered by many the backbone of the peace accords and a critical component of the larger Integrated System of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition. Its success will largely depend on the engagement of civil society actors like her.

The JEP will handle the cases of people who participated directly in the armed conflict including military and security personnel and the FARC, though indirect participants may also appear before the JEP voluntarily. In exchange for verifiable full disclosure of all critical facts and complete cooperation with investigations, those accepting responsibility for human rights violations can benefit from reduced and alternative sentences, which may include community service. As of November, more than 1,700 members of the armed forces had applied to go through the JEP, and 3,491 FARC had inscribed as well.

Efforts to establish the JEP have progressed slowly in the first year since the accord with the FARC despite significant resistance from Colombia’s political opposition.

**Human Rights Experience**

In September, following an exhaustive review process, a selection committee picked 38 judges to lead the judicial mechanism.

Two months later, after Congress added hotly contested amendments to the JEP law including one barring magistrates with human rights experience from participating, a statute detailing the specific mandate and functioning of the program was approved. If it passes muster with the Constitutional Court early next year, the Peace Tribunals may finally become operational as early as the second half of 2018.

In the meantime, Combita and her allies press ahead because the prison engagements are critical to restoring relationships between civil society and the sector and moving Colombia closer to a [durable peace](https://www.usip.org/publications/2016/06/qa-colombia-cease-fire-accord-marks-historic-turn).

“Sometimes as men, we have a hard time reflecting on the past, and being okay with crying and letting go, and allowing ourselves to know each other better and grow closer, despite our circumstances,” said one of the prisoners as the session wrapped up. “What we’re doing here is beautiful.”",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"

2393069,"UNHCR Europe Monthly Report (November 2017) **TRENDS AND KEY FIGURES**

Between 1 January 2017 and 30 November 2017, 171,300 refugees and migrants arrived by sea and land to Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain and Cyprus only, including arrivals to the Canary Islands and by land to Spain). While sea arrivals to Europe in November were 51% lower than last year, largely due to fewer people crossing from Libya, higher numbers crossed from Libya in November than in October while Spain recorded the highest number of land and sea arrivals this year. 

As of 30 November, over 117,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Italy by sea in 2017 with just over 21,800 crossing in the past four months compared to over 95,200 in the first seven months of the year. As of the end of November, sea arrivals to Italy were 32% lower than during the first 11 months of 2016. Arrivals to Italy this year have included 15,540 unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) who comprised 13% of sea arrivals, similar to the same period last year when 14% of arrivals were UASC. While there was a 6% decrease in the number of sea arrivals in November compared to those of October, this was largely due to a significant decrease in crossings of Tunisians from Tunisia. In contrast, arrivals from Libya increased by approximately 84% in November compared to October. Eritreans were the largest group arriving in Italy in November, with more than 1,100 arrivals, over 700 of whom had arrived on just two boats. A group of Eritreans reported to UNHCR during disembarkation that they had been travelling for between six months and three years and experiencing various forms of violence and abuse during their journeys. As of the end of November, the primary nationalities that had arrived by sea in Italy in 2017 were Nigerians, Guineans, Ivorians, Bangladeshis, and Malians. 

Over 25,900 refugees and migrants arrived to Spain by the end of November, by land and sea, an increase of 106% compared to the same period last year. 

Although the number of sea arrivals (20,195) have tripled in 2017, they are still a manageable figure for a country like Spain and far from the numbers experienced in other countries in recent years.  
While arrivals by sea, mainly to the Andalusian coast, represent almost 80% of the total, the number of arrivals via the land borders has also increased by 13% compared to the same period last year. The majority of arrivals by sea in November continued to be Moroccans, Algerians, Ivoiriens and Guineans while the largest group entering via the land borders was Syrians (300 in November alone).

As of 30 November 2017, over 27,300 refugees and migrants had reached Greek shores in 2017, compared to over 171,700 arriving in the same period last year (an 84% reduction). Arrivals so far this year mainly originate from the Syrian Arab Republic (42%) and Iraq (19%). In November, 49% of sea arrivals were from Syria, 18% from Iraq and 11% from Afghanistan cumulatively amounting to 78%.  
More than 40% of each of these nationalities in November were children. Most arrivals in November have been to Lesvos (62%), followed by Chios (25%), Samos (9%), Kos (1%) and Rhodes (2%).  
In addition to the sea arrivals, an estimated 5,100 people have arrived this year at the Evros Greek-Turkish land border, based on provisional data as of 30 November 2017 with some 700 crossing via this route in November, including a number of Syrian families.  
These figures are similar to the 800 who arrived in October 2017 but nearly double when compared with recorded arrivals in November 2016 (370). Arrivals via the Turkey-Greece land border are not subject to the provisions of the EU-Turkey Statement.  
According to Turkish authorities, the Turkish Coast Guard (TCG) intercepted or rescued 2,052 people during November, contributing to a total of 20,452 in 2017 of persons mostly headed to Greece. The largest group intercepted or rescued at sea in 2017 continues to be Syrians. Since the beginning of the year, some 27,258 persons were intercepted by Land Forces at the Greek and Bulgarian land borders, with over 25,162 (or 92%) intercepted at the Greek land border since the beginning of 2017. Apprehensions at Bulgaria-Turkey and Greece-Turkey borders in November were a total of 3,127.

In the Balkans, over 4,400 refugees and migrants were recorded as present in Serbia as of the end of November with around 91% accomodated in government shelters with 34% comprising of children and 15% women. Amongst those recorded in the country, 52% are from Afghanistan, 14% from Iraq and 2% from Syria. Nearly 550 people registered their intention to seek asylum in Serbia in November. Since the start of the year, 13 people have been granted asylum in the country during first instance procedures. Push-backs continue to be reported from several neighbouring countries.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"

In 2017, Syria entered into its 7th year of conflict and Yemen’s health system is failing due to two years of intensified conflict, the economic crisis and a huge cholera outbreak. In Iraq, a military offensive aiming at liberating Mosul led to the displacement of almost 1 million people. Somalia is facing a triple threat of drought, impending famine, and disease outbreaks. Libya, OPT and Afghanistan struggle to provide health care services in insecure and under-resourced settings.

2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"

• OCHA Director of Operations, Mr. John Ging, visited Ethiopia to review the status of the Government-led international humanitarian response to drought and conflictaffected communities, including internally displaced people. 

• Humanitarian operators receive emergency logistics induction training to equip national emergency management authorities, staff from different agencies and humanitarian actors, with emergency logistics skills to ensure timely and efficient humanitarian response.

• Regional reports of the November-December national humanitarian needs assessment are currently being compiled. The humanitarian requirements for Ethiopia in 2018 will be determined once the compilation of all the regional reports is completed.

• Ethiopia continues to receive undocumented Ethiopian migrants repatriated from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 

**OCHA Director of Operations visited Ethiopia**

On 12-14 December 2017, Mr. John Ging, OCHA Director of Operations, visited Ethiopia to first-hand review the status of the Government-led international humanitarian response to drought and conflict-affected communities, including internally displaced people. The director met and discussed with the federal and regional Government of Ethiopia, donors, humanitarian agencies and communities affected by drought and conflict. Mr.Ging acknowledged the strong partnership the Government of Ethiopia has established over the years with the Humanitarian Country Team. He said that his visit is “a reflection of the importance of that partnership.”

The director visited Hamaressa IDP camp with over 4,000 people internally displaced by the Oromo-Somali inter-communal disputes. Following a briefing by the East Hararge zone administration about the scale of the crisis, Mr.Ging reassured authorities that he is committed to advocating for appropriate response to the crisis. The zonal authorities requested for urgent food and non-food assistance to IDPs East Hararge zone.  

Meanwhile subsequent intercommunal clashes were reported in West Hararge zone of Oromia region on the 12, 15 and 16 December resulting in more than 60 deaths. OCHA will continue to work with Government to verify access conditions and impact on humanitarian operations. Conflict has left close to 857,000 people displaced throughout the country.  

**Visit to Somali region**

During the meeting with the Somali Regional Government authorities, the region requested Mr.Ging’s advocacy support to scale up the ongoing response, particularly amidst the growing IDP needs and called for development investment in durable solutions for predictable pastoralist needs. The region also asked for the speedy implementation of cashbased assistance in all targeted woredas/districts.

SO2: Improve the living conditions of the protracted internally displaced persons (Transitional shelters, NFIs)  
SO3: Facilitate access to durable solutions for IDPs that are willing to locally integrate or return (Permanent shelters)  

**NEEDS ANALYSIS** 

• 1,090,000 newly displaced people are in need of Shelter/NFI assistance. The majority of the displacement is to Baidoa and Mogadishu. The displaced families are confronted with the need of shelter and other household non-food items.

• Nearly 1.4 million protracted Internally Displaced people exist countrywide • Safe and secure settlements are needed to provide crisisaffected communities with protected and healthy living spaces and environments, while ensuring sufficient privacy and dignity.  

**GAPS / CHALLENGES**

- Drought displacements are now taking a protracted trend, with many of those displaced in 2017 not planning to return to areas of origin.

- Many IDP settlements risk evictions for lack of secure tenure. Advocacy is needed to reduce secondary displacements.

- The current dyer rains and flooding are causing further damage to already weak shelters, leaving many without shelter.

- Effective delivery of assistance is hampered by limited access, insecurity, road blocks / check points and poor road network.

- Low funding for Shelter and NFIs has left no stocks prepositioned for emergency response.

***January: Record number of people in need***

At the beginning of 2017, more than 128 million people needed humanitarian assistance in 33 countries. OCHA appealed for US$22.2 billion – the largest humanitarian appeal ever launched.

The Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), then Stephen O’Brien, warned: “The scale of humanitarian crises today is greater than at any time since the United Nations was founded. Not in living memory have so many people needed our support and solidarity to survive and live in safety and dignity.”

By midyear, this had increased to some 145 million people, which means that as needs rise, so does the amount of money needed to help people. Throughout the year, humanitarian agencies reached tens of millions of people and saved millions of lives.

They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent.

2392419,"Country Cash Profile Pakistan - December 2017 Pakistan is one of the country’s most vulnerable to natural and human-induced disasters worldwide.  
In the past fifteen years it has experienced large-scale earthquakes, floods, droughts and complex emergencies. Its humanitarian preparedness and response capacity has developed tremendously in that time. Pakistan already has significant experience of major humanitarian cash transfer programmes and is actively building on this foundation.  

The World Humanitarian Summit’s Grand Bargain (United Nations, 2016) stressed the need to “work together efficiently, transparently and harmoniously with new and existing partners” to move to a more “demand-driven model more responsive to the people we are assisting”. The Grand Bargain’s purpose is to “get more means in to the hands of people in need”. The Government of Pakistan, alongside many of the humanitarian and development partners and practitioners providing assistance to disaster-affected people in the country, fully support this purpose.  

The Grand Bargain’s third commitment is to increase the use and coordination of cash-based programming. The document notes that, while not a panacea suitable in all responses, cash assistance does help deliver “greater choice and empowerment to affected people”. Cash programming should use, link or align with local and national mechanisms such as social protection systems. Aid organization and donors committed to action in six areas:

1. Increase the routine use of cash alongside other aid instruments.

2. Invest in new delivery models to increase scale.

4. Collaborate in cash programming to better understand risks and benefits.

6. Increase the use of cash programming beyond the current low levels.  

This Country Cash Profile demonstrates how Pakistan has forged ahead in the use of cash transfers to address disaster impacts in recent years, learning from experience, and how it proposes to achieve the commitments outlined above. The Profile will provide a snapshot of some of the most significant cash-based programming in Pakistan today, whether provided by government or the humanitarian and development community. It will summarize some recent initiatives on coordination and innovation for humanitarian cash transfer programming and touch on government and private sector delivery mechanisms. Finally, it will describe the Government of Pakistan’s initiative to create a national mechanism for humanitarian cash transfers that, piggy backing on existing, large-scale systems for social protection, bio-metric identity verification, grievance redress and payments, will be truly shock-responsive.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2392204,"Syria Protection Cluster (Turkey): Response Snapshot (as of 30 November 2017) **Response**

The Protection Cluster held  two operational working group meetings to support and strengthen field-level coordination for the ongoing responses in Eastern Ghouta and Northeast Aleppo. Seven members of the Protection Monitoring Task Force conducted 1059 KI interviews in 119 communities, covering 39 sub-districts, 16 districts, in 7 governorates (Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Damascus, Hama, Homs and Idleb). The Cluster released the first quarterly report of the Protection Monitoring Task Force, which is available here in English and Arabic. The report covers data collected through monthly monitoring from March to June 2017. Data was collected by 12 partners in 1,534 key informant interviews conducted in seven governorates, mostly in northern Syria. The Cluster and Sub-Clusters Technical Review Committees finalized both the second standard Humanitarian Fund allocation, awarding $2M to eight projects. The Cluster reviewed and recommended 12 protection (standalone and integrated) projects for the 2018 HRP, with a budget request of $11.4M.

The GBV Sub-Cluster actively engaged in the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) with the technical review, vetting and final approval of 16 GBV stand-alone projects and 10 integrated projects (GBV-CP or GBV-CP-General Protection). The GBV SC coordination team organized a learning session for GBV SC members (group 2) on GBV supervisory structures. The session was attended by 10 participants (9F, 1M) representing 9 organizations. The new GBV SC IMO hosted by Global Communities started work on Nov 1. On 25th Nov, the 16 Days of Activism against GBV campaign took off with a series of activities in Syria, mainly in WGSS  and in Turkey. The GBV SC engaged in advocacy actions with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), on the importance of a multi-sectoral response to GBV and launching the VOICES from Syria 2018 report. The GBV SC also organized a 4Ws refresher training, attended by 29 people (17M, 12W). Finally the GBV SC organized a 10 days training for Case Managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, GBV SOPs, PSS and Case Management. The first part of this took place from 28th Nov to 2nd Dec and was attended by 17 participants (14F, 3M), representing 14 organizations.

The child protection sub-cluster hosted in Gaziantep the yearly WOS CP meet for partners on 23-24 November. In attendance were 58 participants from 43 organizations. Participants had the opportunity to reflect on the 2017 HRP implementation as well as agree on the strategy for 2018. The need to improve inter-hub engagement on issues such as family tracing, was also highlighted. Field test of the Situation Monitoring tool was conducted and data collected and analyzed. 89 KII were conducted in Rural Damascus, Idleb and Aleppo. This was done to test the tool, the questions and process.

15 Mine Action project were approved to be included in 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) after going through the vetting , strategic and technical review process.  Efforts continue to integrate risk education materials within different sectors distributions.

**Gap**

Limited specialized services or inclusive services for other groups with specific needs, e.g. persons with disabilities or older persons, remains a critical gap for the Cluster.

Limited funding for some partners affecting their capacity to scale up response in a timely manner as required.

There is a high need to increased coverage of areas in need. Many areas and IDPs still have not been reached with risk education.

**Plan**

Conduct the final centrality of protection training of 2017. Hold a 4W introductory session for new member organizations.

The 16 Days of Activism will continue until the 10th Dec with activities in Syria, especially in the WGSS and in Turkey. The second part of the 10 days training for GBV case managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, PSS, SOPs and Case Management will be conducted from 4th to 10th Dec. In Dec a CMR specialist from Amman will visit Gaziantep and will meet and train GBV and Health actors. 2 CMR trainings are also planned inside Syria during December. The GBV SC will engage in the consultation process to support the Global GBV AOR in the development of the 2018-2020 Global Strategy.

Finalize the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and key informant interview (KII) survey tool for CP situation and monitoring. Support 5 partners (3 Syrian NGOs, 1 INGO and 1 UN agency) to attend the global Case Management Supervision and Coaching Training in Amman (4 – 8 December).

- 9,483 individuals were reached with Gender Based Violence (GBV) response. 7,227 individuals in Mudug, 1,203 individuals in Bay, 753 individuals in Banadir and 300 individuals in Galgaduud regions through: identification of survivors, awareness raising & community engagement and legal, material, medical and psychosocial support, including provision of dignity kits and installation of solar lanterns.

**Situation overview**

From 1 to 30 November, the UNHCR-led Protection & Returns Monitoring Network (PRMN), recorded 32,000 new displacements (12,000 drought-related), bringing the total of internal displacements since the beginning of the year to 1,096,000, of which 874,000 attributable to the drought and 188,000 conflict related.

A spike in conflict driven displacements in multiple regions was observed during November - heightened military operations in Middle Shabelle (Balcad district) and ongoing conflict in Lower Shabelle were the major contributors (15,000 individuals).

While approximately 6,000 IDP returns were recorded in the month (2,000 in Mudug region and substantially all of the remainder in Bay region), these numbers appear low as the onset of the rainy season might be expected to catalyse larger IDP returns as those displaced return to home villages to plant or tend crops.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"

2392149,"Tropical storm Tembin devastates Southern Philippines, CARE responds Tropical storm Tembin, locally known as Vinta, brought catastrophic damage to several provinces in Mindanao, south of Philippines. The death toll in the storm’s onslaught rose to at least 240 particularly in communities swept by flash floods and landslides in Zamboanga Peninsula region before Christmas day.  

Tembin’s heavy downpour caused flooding, landslides and flashfloods that destroyed houses, rice fields and infrastructures. Over 500,000 people were affected in eight regions. Of which, more than 90,000 are now staying in evacuation centers.

International humanitarian organization CARE has mobilized its emergency team and local partners in Mindanao to conduct needs and damage assessments. CARE’s partner Agri-Aqua Development Coalition is assessing in the Zamboanga Peninsula, one of the hardest hit regions. Another partner Mindanao Coalition of Development NGO Networks is in Lanao provinces where communities experienced widespread flooding.

“Our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy as this disaster happened before Christmas Day, a festive time for Filipinos to be with their families. Many are now staying in evacuation centers because their houses were totally destroyed by flashfloods,” said David Gazashvili, CARE’s Country Director in the Philippines. “Our emergency team and our partner organizations are ready to provide relief assistance.”

CARE has worked in the Philippines since 1949, providing emergency relief when disaster strikes and helping communities prepare for disasters. CARE specializes in providing life-saving assistance and has more than seven decades of experience helping people recover from disasters.

2392139,"The Assad Regime Has Dropped Nearly 70,000 Barrel Bombs on Syria - The Ruthless Bombing SNHR has released a report entitled: “The Ruthless Bombing” which documents that Syrian regime forces has dropped nearly 70,000 barrel bombs since July 2012.
 
The report says that the use of barrel bombs by the Syrian regime army manifest one of the most appalling ways in which the international community has blatantly let down the Syrian people as these barrel bombs have been forgotten almost completely in the last year with no condemnations to be heard about the repeated use of this barbarian type of weapons. Additionally, the report questions the possibility of accepting a regime that drops barbarian barrels on its own country without agreeing to any form of political settlements, except for one that rehabilitees it and only leads to giving some ceremonial ministries to its opponents.
 
Fadel Abdul Ghany, chairman of SNHR, says:
“The repeated use of this arbitrary, indiscriminate weapon against residential communities is a message to the Syrian people that protecting civilians and the international law are mere illusions, and that you have to submit and accept the regime that is killing you. Security Council has to take decisive action against the Syrian regime’s use of arbitrary weapon on this large, widespread scale. The U.N. special envoy has also to play a more effectual role in putting an end to the winter of barrel bombs in Syria.”
 
The report documents the toll of barrel bomb use by Syrian regime forces from the first time it was used in July 2012 until December 2017 and the resultant casualties and attacks on vital civilian facilities. The report stresses that the use of barrel bombs haven’t stopped for even one month, including the months that saw de-escalation agreements or Geneva Talks.
 
The report draws upon the daily, ongoing, routine monitoring and documentation efforts, in addition to accounts by survivors, eyewitnesses, and local media activists as the report contains nine accounts. Also, the report relies on videos and pictures that were posted online.
 
The report sheds light on the nature of barrel bombs, manufacture methods used by the Syrian regime, types of containers and explosive materials, and whatever chemical or incendiary substances that are added in some cases. Also, the report outlines a number of areas where the Syrian regime used barrel bombs heavily in the context of military progression such as Darayya city and Khan al Sheih town in Damascus suburbs, and al Mayadeen city in Deir Ez-Zour.
 
The report records that no less than 68,334 barrel bombs have been dropped by Syrian regime helicopters or fixed-wing warplanes from its first documented use in July 2012 until December 2017. These barrel bombs have resulted in the killing of 10,763 civilians, including 1,734 children and 1,689 women (adult female). In addition, no less than 565 attacks on vital civilian facilities were recorded in which barrel bombs were used, including 76 on medical facilities, 140 on schools, 160 on mosques, and 50 on markets.
 
According to the report, the governorates that saw the largest portion of barrel bombs were Damascus and its suburbs, followed by Aleppo and then Daraa while barrel bombs were used the most in 2015 where Syrian regime forces dropped 17,318 barrel bombs in that year alone.
 
The report says that Security Council resolution 2139 represented some hope for the Syrian people due to the fact that barrel bombs were explicitly mentioned in that resolution which also promised to take further steps in the case of non-compliance. However, the rate of barrel bomb use, according to the report, never changed after the resolution was adopted. The report divides the overall toll of barrel bombs before and after the resolution as the report records no less than 20,183 barrel bombs since from July 2012 to February 22, 2014, when the resolution was adopted, while no less than 48,151 barrel bombs were documented in the period of time from the resolution was adopted until December 2017.
 
According to the report, 87 attacks with barrel bombs loaded with a poison gas and four attacks with barrel bombs loaded with incendiary ammunitions were recorded. All of these attacks took place after Security Council resolution 2139 was adopted.
 
The report stresses that the Syrian government has, beyond any doubt, violated Security Council Resolutions 2139 and 2254, and used barrel bombs in a systematic, widespread manner. Also, the Syrian government, through the crime of willful killing, has violated Article 7 of Rome Statute as well as the rules of the international human rights law, which guarantee the right to life. Seeing that these crimes were committed in a non-international armed conflict, it constitutes war crimes.
 
The report adds that barrel bomb attacks are an indiscriminate bombing that targeted defenseless civilians and caused significant damages to civilian objects. The damage was too excessive compared to the anticipated military benefit.
 
According to the report, The Syrian regime has violated the rules of the customary international law, the CWC, and all relevant Security Council resolutions -particularly 2118, 2209, and 2235- through the use of barrel bombs. Additionally, using chemical weapons constitutes a war crime according to the ICC’s Rome Statue.
 
Furthermore, the report says that Syrian regime forces have used barrel bombs loaded with incendiary ammunitions against populated residential neighborhoods without taking any measures to reduce the damages to civilians and civilian buildings and facilities.
 
The report calls on the Security Council to ensure the serious implementation of its resolutions, and calls on the four permanent state members to apply pressure on the Russian government in order to cease its support for the Syrian regime. In addition, the report stresses that an arms embargo should be imposed on the Syrian regime and all those who supply the Syrian regime with finance and weapon should be prosecuted in light of the risk of these weapons being used in crimes and serious violations of human rights.
 
Also, the report calls on the Security Council to refer the Syrian case to the International Criminal Court and provide all possible facilitations in this regard. Additionally, the report says that the Security Council should start imposing security and peace and Syria and prosecute all those whose involvement in perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity should be prosecuted. The report calls on the European Union and the United States to support the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism that was established in accordance with General Assembly Resolution 71/248, adopted on December 21, 2016, establish local tribunals that enjoy a universal jurisdiction, and address the war crimes that were perpetrated in Syria.
 
The report says that steps should be taken on the national and regional levels to form alliances to support and protect the Syrian people from the daily killing. In addition, steps should be taken to put the principle of universal jurisdiction into practice with regard to these crimes before local tribunals. Moreover, the report says that pressure should be applied on the Syrian government in order to compel it to ratify Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and comply with its restrictions.
 
The report calls for the implementation of the “Responsibility to Protect’ (R2P) norm especially after all political steps had been consumed through the agreement of the Arab League and then Kofi Annan’s plan and the Cessation of Hostilities statements and Astana Agreements that followed. Therefore, steps under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations should be taken, and the norm of the Responsibility to Protect, which was established by the United Nations General Assembly, should be implemented. The Security Council is still hindering the protection of civilians in Syria.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2392134,"Philippines: IFRC warns of worsening conditions following deadly Tropical Storm Tembin Manila/Kuala Lumpur 26 December —Four days after tropical storm Tembin made landfall in Mindanao, thousands of survivors are still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.

“Our teams in Mindanao are doing all they can to reach everyone who needs them. But the work is difficult and often slow,” says Philippine Red Cross Chairman Gordon. “Around the world, people are spending this time period with their families. For people affected by Tembin, what should be a peaceful time is instead full of uncertainty and fear. We need to help them.”

As responders reach the worst affected areas, details of the havoc wrought by Tembin (known locally as “Vinta”) continue to emerge. More than 500,000 people in 23 provinces have been affected. The national disaster risk reduction and management council (NDRRMC) confirms that 164 people have lost their lives to the flashfloods and landslides, with 176 are still missing. The number of casualties is expected to increase as the public authorities verify information being received from the provinces.

In addition to causing the loss of human lives and internal displacement, Tembin has substantially impacted shelter and livelihoods and caused damage to crops and critical infrastructure including roads, bridges and power transmission lines.

Volunteers and search and rescue teams from the Philippine Red Cross have been active since the hours before the storm made landfall, and are now working to reach people in need with water, food, and emergency shelter. Hot meals are being served, and welfare services provided in the evacuation centers, where over 50,000 people are staying after being evacuated prior to the landfall of the storm.

To support these efforts, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is joining the Philippine Red Cross in [appealing](https://reliefweb.int/node/2392084) for 2.8 million Swiss francs to assist more than 20,000 people affected by the storm in four of the worst affected provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro.

“People have gone through a massive shock. In just minutes, they lost everything, and then had to fight for their lives as walls of mud and water washed through their homes,” says Patrick Elliott, IFRC Operations and Programmes Manager in the Philippines.

“Now we must ensure that affected communities have immediate access to essential items and services including cash, food, water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, as well to information, psychosocial support, and protection.”

2392089,"IOM Iraq Holds Community Policing Conference on Ninewa Baghdad - In cooperation with Iraq’s Ministry of Interior, IOM Iraq held a conference on 20 December on Community Policing in Ninewa Governorate, which aims to promote cooperation between law enforcement agencies and community members towards peace and security.

Ninewa was deeply affected by the occupation by ISIL and associated conflict, with heavy damage to its infrastructure – especially in its capital Mosul – and extensive displacement, with more than 941,000 individuals still displaced across the governorate.

In 2016, with funding from the German Federal Foreign Office, IOM Iraq started the project to strengthen community policing in retaken areas of Ninewa and other conflict-affected areas in Iraq. This is done through the establishment of Community Policing Forums (CPFs) which are inclusive platforms that involve police officers, local leaders, civil society organization representatives and community members, where citizens can raise and discuss their security concerns. CPFs identify and develop initiatives that lead to safer communities, protect the most vulnerable and enhance cooperation, transparency and mutual trust between these actors. CPF members analyze the available resources in their respective communities and assess the ability of a wide range of actors to find solutions to situations that are potentially dangerous and harmful. As such, CPFs are tools for conflict prevention.

The conference followed a series of activities in November and December that included the establishment of five new CPFs in Ninewa and training for more than 400 individuals, including police officers, community members and civil society representatives, on applying community policing in a context of post-conflict returns.  

The conference was preceded by a three-day workshop exploring the role of women in security dialogue. Over 80 women and men from across Iraq participated, including police, civil society representatives and the community members, to discuss the impact of gender-based violence on community security, the role of women in violent extremism and how women and children affiliated with ISIL should be treated. Workshop participants formed working groups on these topics, and discussed how to implement action plans developed in the event.

The Community Policing conference on Ninewa was held in Baghdad and was attended by government officials, notably Mr. Saad Maan, spokesman of the Ministry of Interior and the Head of Community Police Directorate, Brigadier General Khalid Al Mhannah, NGO staff and CPF representatives from Mosul, Fallujah and Baghdad.

Brigadier General Saad Maan, spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, thanked the German Government, IOM and guests for their efforts in support of the CP model.  “We have been working very hard to put Iraqi citizens first. There will be no sustainable security in the governorates unless citizens are part of it, and that is exactly the foundation of this initiative, by strengthening community policing forums across the country, especially in Ninewa. We have achieved great results in stabilizing the country thanks to the cooperation with our international partners,” said Saad Maan.

Speakers also included CPF members from Al-Amiriat Al-Fallujah and Mosul (Baasheka), police officers, community members and civil society organization representatives, who introduced and discussed the successes and challenges of the CPFs in Ninewa. The conference gave CPF members the opportunity to network and share experiences.

“The sharing of experiences, successes and challenges of Community Policing Forums in retaken areas will help us to improve the next phase of this project and build on mutual trust that has been established”, said IOM Iraq Chief of Mission Gerard Waite.

“I am very grateful for the cooperation between the government of Iraq and Germany on this Community Policing project,” said Dr. Cyrill Nunn, German Ambassador to Iraq. “We have high hopes that the success of the project can contribute to the much-needed reconciliation and stabilization in Iraq,” added the Ambassador, highlighting the valuable contribution of CPFs for the stabilization of the Iraqi social fabric.

A total of 66 CPFs have been established across Iraq; of which 42 with the support of IOM Iraq; the other 24 have been independently established by local police and communities.

- 61,711 household visits to disseminate life saving messages have been completed (16,191 today) by community mobilisation volunteers. So far, orientation training of 800 volunteers and 107 staff has been completed.

**KEY CHALLENGES**

**Community’s resistance**

Sometimes local mosques show resistance towards the child friendly space activities. Thus, influential members of the community itself, such as religious leaders (imams), need to be engaged in productive discussion to increase understanding of the necessity of these activities. Active community membership and productive engagement in child protection committees can also play a significant role in opening the mindsets of the people.

**Access to market**

Rice is availed as a relief item; however, other food items (protein or vegetables) need to acquired to ensure a balanced diet. Although many FDMNs have cash, they are unable to purchase these additional items as the markets places are far from settlement and are hard to access. Another problem is that women do not have a way to earn money, as their skills may be limited to what they can produce (e.g. sew clothes and sell) and also being unable to utilise the local markets.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"

2391679,"The Southern Cameroon crisis: bridging the middle ground 22 December 2017: There is an ongoing crisis in Cameroon. Thousands have fled the English-speaking areas of the country because of violence and unrest, and many are calling for an independent state. What has the government done to alleviate this situation, and does it go far enough?

For several decades, the minority English-speaking community in Cameroon has been expressing its disillusionment with the reunification process that brought the English and the French-speaking parts of the country together in 1961.

They complain about marginalisation and under-representation in the country’s Francophone-dominated administration. Such conditions are in direct contravention to the reunification accords which pledged to preserve the status of the erstwhile autonomous English-speaking state of West Cameroon federated with French-speaking East Cameroon. This union was abruptly terminated in 1972 leading to the dissolution of the State of West Cameroon into two administrative provinces.

This issue of contention has since sparked recurrent waves of protests in Anglophone Cameroon. Fresh protests broke out in October 2016, following a strike by Anglophone teachers and lawyers demanding for educational and judiciary reforms.

Pro-Anglophone movements took advantage of the strikes to demand a return to a federal system of administration that was abolished in 1972 while others have been pushing for the [establishment of an independent state](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/171001123925310.html), separate from the majority French-speaking areas.

As it now stands, [thousands have fled](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/thousands-flee-violence-cameroons-anglophone-region-171221102642211.html) the English-speaking areas because of continued violence and unrest.

**Protests, strikes and boycotts**

Thus far, protests have largely been nonviolent in nature. These include controversial school boycotts, enforcement of general strikes (known locally as ‘ghost towns’), public protests, advocacy campaigns and the establishment of a governing council to speak on behalf of the Anglophones, which was set up by pro-Anglophone movements in the diaspora.

However, violent incidents such as the [burning down of school buildings](https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-school-set-fire-anglophone-strike-deepens/3997440.html) have also recently been witnessed. The involvement of pro-Anglophone movements in these crimes, however, has yet to be fully established beyond a set of unproven assumptions claiming that their aim was to reinforce continued school shut down.

Current protests have resulted in increased youth radicalisation, the loss of lives, the destruction of property, the imprisonment of Anglophone activists, school shut downs, poor school performance, a slowdown in economic activity, an Anglophone diaspora at odds with the government, a general sense of insecurity and a deep sense of political distrust between the Anglophone communities and the government.

The crisis contributes to the multiple conflicts risks threatening Cameroon’s fragile peace. These include the Boko Haram insurgency infiltrating the country from neighbouring Nigeria and the uncertainty that characterises the peaceful political transition from the 34-year old regime in Cameroon.

**Dialogue for peace**

This Anglophone crisis is a divisive and politically sensitive subject handled with caution by civil society organisations and Cameroon’s friends and partners.

None of them boldly identify themselves with either side but have however expressed concerns over human right abuses. They have called for dialogue towards sustainable peace. These include the United States Department of the State, The African Union Commission, the United Nations Secretariat for Central Africa, the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa, Pope Francis and the Bar Council of England and Wales.

Earlier in the crisis, Roman Catholic Bishops in Anglophone Cameroon issued a letter stating their understanding of Anglophone grievances. They have called for dialogue to facilitate their peaceful resolution. The same call came from the Fons (ethnic traditional rulers) of Cameroon’s North West Region who, like some Independent Opinion Leaders, have urged for the release of pro-Anglophones detainees to foster peace.

**Palliative measures**

n December 2016, the government responded to the crisis by engaging in talks with members of a civil society consortium that was created to speak on behalf of the Anglophone communities. These talks, however, were short-lived due to the political nature of some of the demands.

In a subsequent controversial move, the state resorted to arresting and detaining the leaders of the consortium. Others went into exile. Access to the internet was suspended in English-speaking Cameroon for three months to curb the flow of information that the government believed was fanning the crisis.

Since then, continued calls for dialogue have largely been ignored. In August 2017, the government sent delegations to discuss the state of the crisis with the diaspora. This initiative was met with stiff resistance from Anglophone activists living abroad.

Nonetheless, the government has begun introducing a series of progressive measures to address some pertinent concerns regarding the effective integration of the Anglophone communities in Cameroonian society.

These include the translation of the OHADA Uniform Act (a law harmonising business transactions in Africa) into the English language, the creation of the National Commission for Bilingualism and Multiculturalism to foster greater national integration, the creation of a Common Law Bench at the Supreme Court of Cameroon as well as a Common Law Department at the School of Administration and the English-speaking Universities of Buea and Bamenda. Some pro-Anglophone activists under detention have also been released.

These, however, have been judged as palliative measures. They do not tackle the root cause of the crisis – supposedly the quest for a federal state or secession. Some pro-Anglophone movements want a neutral third party mediating talks to resolve the crisis.

This is where the deadlock lies and until this is broken, it is uncertain the crisis will end anytime soon.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"

Water, sanitation, care and management of injuries and access to food are the most immediately and life-saving needs.

UNICEF team out of the Mindanao Field Office is working around the clock with partners on the ground to assess the extent of damage and loss.

UNICEF stands ready to deliver lifesaving water, sanitation and hygiene supplies upon request. UNICEF’s prepositioned water and sanitation supplies, that are ready to move, include water kits for families, large water bladders for community use, water purification tablets, jerry cans, and tents.

Of particular concern are the internally displaced in camps, communities already vulnerable from Marawi conflict who are once again affected. Tents were easily destroyed by the winds and rain and drove families to seek shelter elsewhere.

Lanao del Sur has been badly hit. UNICEF is present in some of the affected areas and will continue to monitor and maintain close contacts with local authorities.

The Emergency Appeal is currently being revised and these changes will be reflected. The revised Emergency Appeal will be focused in carrying out roof repairs in coordination with the local authorities.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

**A.2 Summary of current response**

**Overview of Host National Society**

4,225 volunteers are activated, of which 2,533 are from the operations and relief groups carrying out recovery work in the affected regions in sanitation and epidemic control including 531 volunteers working in the protection centres. The Restoring Family Link (RFL) office is working with 168 volunteers at the municipal level, in the 15 provinces and the central headquarters) with 1,161 volunteers

**Overview of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement in the country**

The IFRC continues providing support and coordination with the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) through its Country Cluster Support Team based in Dominican Republic, and through the Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) based in Panama. The Country Cluster Support Team and the regional disaster management coordinator (also emergency shelter focal point) are giving the support to all the response actions of this operation. The sectors and needs addressed by this Emergency Appeal were identified by the CRC in coordination with the government.

The Spanish Red Cross, who has had presence in the country, deployed one staff member to support the National Society’s response efforts. In addition, on the onset of the emergency and on 9 October, two staff members from the Canadian Red Cross Society were deployed to Cuba with the aim to contribute to the response requirements of the Cuban Red Cross.

The Cuban Red Cross coordinated bilaterally with the Spanish Red Cross, through its permanent cooperation program, a shipment of new clothes and footwear for adults, and psycho-pedagogical centres including children without subsidiary protection.

**Movement Coordination**

The Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) has been sharing official information from the CRC with all Movement members. The CRC led coordination meetings at country level with the Spanish Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Society.

At the onset of Hurricane Irma, communication was established with Movement partners to inform of the storm’s path through the Caribbean.

2391604,"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock – Statement on Yemen, 24 December 2017 I remain deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Yemen, where more than 22 million people need humanitarian assistance – 8.4 million of whom are already on the edge of starvation. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have continued and must stop. I am encouraged, however, by the news that the first commercial fuel imports into Hudaydah port since 6 November docked today, while commercial food imports that resumed in recent weeks have continued. 

Yemen imports approximately 90 per cent of its food and nearly all its fuel and medicine. The steady flow of these imports is a lifeline for millions of civilians. Commercial food imports are needed to keep food available and affordable in markets across the country. Fuel imports are essential to run generators in hospitals and health facilities, as well as to power water networks and sanitation systems, among other essential activities. Millions of people depend on these critical services. Hudaydah port is the closest port to the majority of Yemenis. 

As Yemen continues to grapple with widespread hunger, malnutrition, internal displacement, the world’s largest cholera outbreak, an alarming diphtheria outbreak and other challenges, it is essential that we work together to keep commercial food, medicine and fuel imports flowing into all ports. We must also ensure that life-saving humanitarian assistance is able to enter all ports swiftly and quickly reaches the millions of people who need it. Humanitarian aid is often shipped on commercial vessels, further underscoring the importance of keeping all ports open to humanitarian and commercial vessels. I am committed to working with all stakeholders to achieve this as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to seeing commercial imports of critical supplies stabilize at adequate levels. 

Commercial imports alone will not be enough to address the vast humanitarian crisis in Yemen or to provide a sustainable solution. I therefore reiterate my call for all parties to the conflict to provide unconditional, sustained humanitarian access – for both staff and supplies – across the country and without interference. I also call on all parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and engage meaningfully with the United Nations to achieve an inclusive, negotiated political settlement.

Ukraine is one of Europe's trafficking hotspots, with 61,000 people trafficked since 2014 - mostly while looking for better job opportunities abroad, according to the United Nations migration agency.

Most victims are taken to Russia, Poland and other European countries where they are forced to work in factories, building sites, farms and as beggars or sex workers, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says.

BUSINESS BOOST

When Iryna arrived in Belarus in 2014 with a group of 15 Ukrainians, their passports were confiscated and they were paid $200 in the first three months - barely enough to afford food.

""We didn't even know where we were,"" she said, recalling how they were moved to various construction sites in remote areas.

Threatened at gunpoint, the group worked up to 18 hours a day renovating a two-storey house over several months. They slept on the floor, and were fed only ready-made boiled noodles.

Those who complained were beaten, said Iryna, who fell ill.

""I had problems with my stomach and a high temperature but no one would bring me medicines,"" she said.

When her captors realised she could not keep working, they returned her passport and abandoned her in the capital, Minsk.

She spent the summer doing casual jobs until she made enough money to buy a train ticket home in 2015 to Vinnytsia.

She was financially and spiritually broken, her mother having died of cancer while she was enslaved in Belarus.

""I had a terrible depression because I couldn't save my mum,"" she said, choking back tears as she recalled her return.

Yet two years on, Irnya has turned her life around.

An IOM project to help former slaves reintegrate into society, by providing them with training and money to start a business, helped her to set up a small embroidery workshop and earn enough to feed her family.

Iryna received $800 last year, which she spent on a sewing machine. She now produces towels, tablecloths and other embroidery items that she sells online and at local fairs.

""I am happy,"" she said. ""I don't have to think about getting money to buy bread.""

""EATING MY SKIN""

The trafficking business is thriving in Ukraine.

The IOM identified 639 victims in the first six months of 2017 - 30 percent up on the same period last year.

Economic crisis and political upheaval linked to the conflict in eastern Ukraine have fuelled the crime, it says.

Igor, another Ukrainain survivor, was beaten up, fed rotten food and forced to handle chemical barrels without safety equipment after being lured to Russia with the promise of a well-paid job four years ago.

Chemical leaks burned his hands, and left them itching.

""Basically it was eating my skin,"" the 37-year-old said by phone, declining to give his real name.

He was freed after about six months as his health worsened.

Igor is happy to be in Ukraine, having started a furniture company with three fellow victims he met through the IOM project, which teaches groups of up to 30 people skills to run a small company, such as management, accounting and marketing.

Since it started in 2006, almost 1,000 slavery survivors have started businesses, from pig farms and beauty salons to coffee shops and cucumber greenhouses.

Students are encouraged to submit a business plan to apply for a grant of up to $2,700 in equipment for their enterprise.

""The idea ... is to help people monetise their skills,"" said Ali Chabuk, a senior livelihood specialist at IOM Ukraine.

Owning a business also helps victims' psychological recovery, he added.

""They see themselves as something valuable, as key participants to the local economic development,"" Chabuk said.

Former slaves such as Iryna and Igor share their stories at events organised by IOM's partner charities in Ukraine - trying to raise awareness about how migration can lead to slavery.

""There's a lot of people that are trying to find themselves somewhere else, in random countries without understanding that it's possible to do something here,"" said Igor.

""My life has really settled down. It has taken on a different meaning and different colours.""",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2391554,"Rwandan refugees encouraged to repatriate before the coming into effect of the cessation Clause Since 2011, the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees has carried out different activities encouraging the Rwandan refugees who were still living in exile to repatriate before the coming into effect of the Comprehensive Solutions Strategy (Cessation Clause) on 31st December, 2017. 

84,596 Rwandans have been repatriated since 2009.  The Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees supported those Rwandans to be well integrated in the Rwandan Society. However, there are Rwandans still living in host countries under the refugee status. 

In a press conference held on 22nd December, 2017 on the coming into effect of the cessation clause, the Hon. Minister of MIDIMAR, DE BONHEUR Jeanne d’Arc encouraged the Rwandan refugees to repatriate or get necessary documents allowing them to live legally in host countries before the coming into effect of the cessation Clause on 31st December, 2017.

“Since Rwanda is a peaceful country, we encourage the Rwandans to repatriate before the coming into effect of the cessation clause. Further, for those who are carrying out different activities in host countries, they advised to get necessary documents allowing them to legally live  in those countries,” the Minister said during the press conference with national and international media.

Apart from advising the Rwandans to repatriate or get necessary documents, the Hon. Minister reminded the Rwandans living under the refugee status that they will no longer get support from international Humanitarian organizations as usual from the time the cessation clause comes into effect.

“According to international convention, once the refugees’ status is abolished the support also ceases. For this reason, we remind the Rwandans to repatriate or get necessary documents to avoid legal stances from host countries and the lack of support from the humanitarian organizations,” she reminded.

The Cessation Clause on Rwandan refugees which comes into effect on 31st December, 2017 will have no extension as it has previously been. The coming into effect of the cessation Clause impacts the Rwandans who fled the country between 1959 and 1998. 

The cessation clause is provided by the 1951 Convention in its article 1 C spelling out the conditions under which a refugee ceases to be called a refugee. It clarifies that the cessation clause comes into effect when stateless persons whose reasons for becoming refugees have ceased to exist.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"
2391519,"Brussels suspends deportation of Sudanese asylum seekers After reports that Sudanese were tortured upon their forced return from Belgium, deportations have been suspended, pending an investigation.

Belgium will refrain from sending refugees back to Sudan until the end of January, after reports that at least six Sudanese asylum seekers sent back to their homeland have been held and seripusly maltreated upon their return.

In September, State Secretary for Asylum and Immigration, Theo Francken, invited Sudanese officials to Brussels to help authorities identify Sudanese migrants and arrange for their forced repatriation. He wanted the delegation to review the cases of more than 100 illegal Sudanese, many of whom were arrested at the Maximiliaan Park in Brussels.

Human rights groups heavily criticised the step and warned that the officials were likely to be security agents, sent to target political refugees.

According to testimonies collected by the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, some of those returned were tortured. Two have since fled Sudan again.

“When I landed in Sudan, they stopped me for hours in the intelligence offices, they wanted to know why I went to Europe, who I met, and how I got there,"" one of the deported immigrants reported.

“I was beaten with sticks, beaten constantly, after two days they released me, I was so scared that I was bedridden for three days after that,” he said. “They [the Sudanese authorities] made me sign documents stating that I would not carry out any political action and that I would never leave the country. My life is in danger.”

In response to the reports The Belgium Chamber of Representatives held an emergency meeting late on Friday to hear testimony from Francken. “If it turns out that they were really tortured, this will be a big problem,” he told the Belgium press earlier this week. “Then no one will be sent back any more.”

The Netherlands

In November, Dutch police forcibly evicted 90 migrants, including 17 Sudanese nationals. In early December another Sudanese asylum seeker was sent back.

A Sudanese activist living in the Netherlands told Radio Dabanga at the time that the Dutch immigration authority has closed the files of 17 Sudanese nationals including Darfuris, as they doubted their arguments.

Jaber said more than 1046 families have returned from Shangil Tobaya in North Darfur to 15 villages in the Al-Wihda County, pointing the returnees became convinced that the security situation is stable following the imposition of the state authority.

He added the security organs managed to restore the situation to normal especially after the large deployment of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the area.

The commissioner pointed out that all motorcycles have been confiscated as they constitute the major means of committing crimes in the state.

Jaber further appealed to foreign and national aid groups to move urgently to meet the demands of the returnees in order to encourage them to permanently settle in their villages.

For several years, the government sought to dismantle IDPs camps that have been established in areas around the capitals of Darfur’s five states after the eruption of the armed conflict in the region.

Since the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur in July 2011, the government constructed several villages and vowed to support IDPs who return to their home areas.

However, the displaced complain that the security situation remains the same pointing to the government militia saying they continue to attack them and grab their land.

UN agencies estimate that over 300,000 people were killed in Darfur conflict since 2003, and over 2.5 million are displaced.

The ability of protection partners to regularly access those areas and conduct sustained protection activities remains constrained and unpredictable, with 13 besieged communities reached in October 2017 against 17 reached in July 2017. 58% of the total interventions were in 43 sub-districts categorized as severity 5 or 6 in the updated Protection sector severity scale (as of September 2017). 69% of the total response is delivered in four Governorates – Aleppo, Damascus, Homs and Rural Damascus. Gaps in the protection response remain apparent in some locations, in particular Ar-Raqqa (0.32% interventions conducted in this governorate) and Deir-ez-Zor (0.03% of interventions conducted in this governorate). While active hostilities have come to an end in Ar-Raqqa governorate, widespread contamination of explosive hazards and currently limited survey and clearance capacities of mine action humanitarian agencies continue to hamper the response, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.

UNHCR together with government counterparts and partners continued providing assistance to Somali refugees who decided to voluntarily return home. To ensure sustainable reintegration of Somali refugee returnees, UNHCR provides the enhanced return package2 . Detailed achievements throughout November are presented below per sector.

**Protection and Return Support**

**Return Management**

■ The Government of Kenya have now authorized resumption of road convoys to Somalia but due to rainfalls in the region (Dhobley town, Lower Juba region), most of the return routes are not accessible, making return by road not feasible.

■ Flights to Kismayo have resumed on 21 November. The suspension was put in place on 28 September after the State of Jubaland imposed new landing fees on UN flights. The last return flight from Kenya to Kismayo was received on 28 September.

**Protection Monitoring**

■ UNHCR has shared the Country of Origin Information (COI) for the month of October with the Return Help Desk in Refugee Camps in Kenya and Yemen. The COI includes information about the humanitarian, security and political situation in Somalia. The COI helps Somali refugees make an informed decision about their return.

■ During November, the pilot phase of UNHCR’s new post-returns monitoring system commenced across South Central Somalia. Consultations were held with partners in Mogadishu before the rollout of the telephonic monitoring began. The new monitoring system includes a face-to-face survey.

**Return Figures**

Since the beginning of repatriation in 2014, a total of 109,317 Somalis returned to Somalia; 74,606 from Kenya, 34,077 from Yemen (33,667 spontaneous and 418 assisted) and 626 from other countries of asylum (589 from Djibouti, 34 from Eritrea, two from Tunisia, and one from Pakistan).

The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney T.D., and Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development, Mr. Ciarán Cannon, T.D., today announced additional Irish funding of €500,000 towards the humanitarian response in Yemen, now the world's largest crisis, with over 20 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.

This new funding is in addition to €750,000 provided last month and brings Ireland’s total direct humanitarian support to the crisis in Yemen to over €5.3 million this year, and nearly €12.5 million since 2012. In addition, Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated USD $25.6 million to Yemen in 2017. 

Ireland provides this support through the UN-managed Yemen Humanitarian Fund, an approach which allows for the most urgent needs to be met quickly, be they for food, shelter, health or protection for the most vulnerable.

 Announcing the funding, the Tánaiste said:

*“The scale and severity of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is overwhelming, and the suffering of the Yemeni people is increasing every day. A staggering 22.2 million people, or 76% of the population, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, an increase of 1.5 million people since June 2017 alone. The UN has warned that Yemen is now the world’s largest man-made humanitarian crisis, with 17.8 million people food insecure and 8.4 million people at risk of starvation.*

*Basic public services are on the brink of collapse, and the cholera outbreak is of an unprecedented scale. Over 3 million people have fled from their homes, and more than 11 million people are in need of protection, facing serious risks to their safety, well-being and basic rights.*

*Following the launch of a missile from Yemen towards Riyadh on 4 November, the Saudi-led coalition imposed restrictions on humanitarian access in Yemen. Ireland unreservedly condemns missile attacks which endanger civilian lives, including the attack on 13 December. Ireland has also consistently highlighted, in bilateral contacts and at EU level, that humanitarian and commercial access to Yemen is necessary to avoid tragedy on an appalling scale. At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I myself urged stronger EU action in this area, and I am personally committed to following this issue closely*.”

Minister of State Cannon added:

“*The humanitarian needs in Yemen continue to exceed available funding, with the UN Humanitarian Response Plan 61% funded. Ireland remains committed to responding where needs are greatest, and we have consistently provided humanitarian support to the people of Yemen. We will continue to do so in 2018*.”

- The UN OCHA Humanitarian Pooled Funds allocate funding in-country to a broad range of partners, including UN organisations, and national and international NGOs. The Pooled Funds form part of the Humanitarian Response Plan for each country and the funding is allocated to meet critical humanitarian needs ranging from food assistance to protection to livelihoods support.

- Ireland has consistently contributed to the humanitarian response in Yemen. Today’s allocation brings Ireland’s total direct humanitarian support to the crisis in Yemen to over €5.3 million this year, and nearly €12.5 million since 2012. In addition, Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated USD $ 25.6 million to Yemen this year.

- The situation for the Yemeni people will only improve permanently with peaceful resolution of the conflict. Ireland supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.

- Ireland will also continue to support efforts to investigate alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and to hold those found guilty of such violations accountable for their actions. At the UN Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen. This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.

- The situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate rapidly. According to the UN, 22.2 million people, or 76% of the population, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. 17.8 million people are currently food insecure, and this is expected to worsen - the UN has warned that 8.4 million people are at risk of famine. Over three million people have been forced to flee from their homes. Critical basic public services in health, water and sanitation, and education, are on the brink of collapse, with 16 million people lacking access to safe water and sanitation and 16.4 million with no access to adequate healthcare.

2391379,"Kandahar leaders strategize on eliminating violence against women **KANDAHAR** - To eliminate violence against women, the support and participation of everyone in Afghan society, especially religious scholars and other community leaders, is crucial, participants said at a UN-backed symposium in the capital of the southern province of Kandahar.

At the day-long event, attendees from civil society, religious leadership, academia, provincial justice offices and the department of women’s affairs discussed the state of violence against women in Kandahar and strategized on new approaches to addressing what many have characterized as an endemic problem in the southern region.

Although the Afghan government has taken steps to improve the welfare of women and eliminate gender-based violence through the Elimination of Violence Against Women legislation, the situation remains unchanged for many women, especially regions of the country where harmful traditional practices still take place.

The event, which was facilitated by the Kandahar regional office of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), ended with participants calling for more to be done by everyone, and for the government to work with community leaders to help bring change.

“Violence against women in Afghanistan must immediately stop,” said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, in recent statement. “For Afghan women to achieve their full potential and their immense capacity in development, in peace and in security, the violations of the rights of women and girls, particularly through violence, must cease.”

One in every three women around the world has experienced physical or sexual violence. Gender-based violence is a global issue, affecting millions each year, particularly the most vulnerable, including Afghan women and girls. It is now widely recognized that violence against women, including harassment and harmful practices, is major barrier to women and girls enjoying their fundamental human rights, and is a direct challenge to women’s inclusion and participation in sustaining peace.

The International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, marked every year by the United Nations on 25 November, represented the start of the global campaign on 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. This year’s 16 Days theme, ‘Leave No One Behind,’ reflected the importance of the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, which commits to eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.

UNAMA is mandated to support the Afghan Government and the people of Afghanistan as a political mission that provides 'good offices' among other key services. 'Good offices' are diplomatic steps that the UN takes publicly and in private, drawing on its independence, impartiality and integrity, to prevent international disputes from arising, escalating or spreading.

UNAMA also promotes coherent development support by the international community; assists the process of peace and reconciliation; monitors and promotes human rights and the protection of civilians in armed conflict; promotes good governance; and encourages regional cooperation.",4600,"Protection and Human Rights"

In November, UNHCR with SARC collectively assisted around 52,000 people with core and supplementary non-food items. Among the locations served include Al Mayadin, Deir-ez-zor City, Enbeh, Lower Baqras, and Shmeitiyeh.

2391354,"UNHCR welcomes Britain’s support for South Sudanese refugees in Sudan [EN/AR] **Khartoum, Sudan, 21 December 2017** - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today welcomed a multi-year contribution of £7.5 million (approximately US$9.9 million) spread over three years from the Government of the United Kingdom to respond to the critical needs of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan, and those anticipated to arrive between 2018 and 2020.

UNHCR will use the funds to provide life-saving assistance to respond to the vital needs of the South Sudanese refugees as well as host communities in White Nile; West and South Kordofan; and East and South Darfur in the area of protection, water and sanitation, and education. The funds will also allow UNHCR to procure non-food items, such as blankets, sleeping mats and cooking kits, for this vulnerable population. South Sudanese refugees arrive in Sudan in very poor condition, exhausted after long walks to reach the borders and in urgent need of protection, especially children who have lost or been separated from their families during the journey.

Dr. Christopher Pycroft, Head of the Department for International Development in Sudan, said “The unfolding tragedy in South Sudan has had terrible human consequences. The British people stand by those affected by conflict and famine, and commit to continue to support the hundreds of thousands of women and children who have been forced to flee their own country, by providing them with safety, food and water and a roof over their heads. DFID has committed to provide this assistance over three years to help our partner UNHCR, and the other aid agencies involved, to plan ahead and deliver life-saving assistance on the ground more effectively, and to help ensure that children continue to have access to Education even during this time of crisis.”

The UK has been a major donor to UNHCR in Sudan for years, contributing over £ 14.8 million (around US$ 20.8 million) in the past four years. This has enabled UNHCR to assist refugees in the country and has greatly contributed to supporting the South Sudan response since the early days of the crisis.  
Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR’s Representative in Sudan particularly welcomed this multi-year agreement and said: “The United Kingdom has consistently demonstrated its commitment to UNHCR activities to assist the most vulnerable children and people from South Sudan. In an operational context that can change very quickly, this multi-year funding will give more predictability and flexibility to UNHCR to respond more efficiently and at scale when a crisis hits and help respond to expected needs in 2018 as part of our contingency planning”.

To date, close to 453,000 South Sudanese have crossed into Sudan since December 2013, and are now residing across 9 states, in addition with an estimated 350,000 remaining in Sudan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.

Sudan continues to open its borders to refugees seeking safety in the country, which is critical as the conflict in South Sudan is becoming ever more complex in parallel with a worsening food security situation.

2393124,"Driven from their lands, Colombia’s Awá struggle to survive By Michelle Begue in Villa Garzon, Colombia  | 

**Back on their ancestral lands in the Colombian rainforest, Awá Mayasquer elder Cuasaluzan Nastacuas hunted, raised livestock and planted food crops.**

But uprooted by the country’s bloody armed conflict, the 63-year-old now gets up each day at three in the morning to find work as a day labourer in a provincial city half-an- hour away by bus. 

“When we lived in the jungle … we worked on the land, planting yucca and raising pigs. We never worked in the city before being displaced,” his son Armando Cuasulzan Pai explains.

Indigenous peoples like the Awá Mayasquer are among those most impacted by more than five decades of armed conflict in Colombia that has displaced more than 7.6 million people both within the country and beyond its borders.

The community, whose lands are in Nariño province in southwest Colombia, were caught in the crossfire between government forces and left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

While a peace agreement in 2016 ended hostilities, the painful memory of rebel massacres that killed at least 11 in 2009, and the fear of landmines, make the community reluctant to return to their traditional home.

“The elders don’t even want to consider going back. They say they’d rather die here than be forced to go back. We decided to stay here and asked for relocation, for security reasons,” says Armando, who the leader of his community.

One of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world, Colombia is home to 102 different indigenous groups. But up to a third, including the Awá, are at risk of extinction because of the conflict and related displacement, according to Colombia’s Constitutional Court.

“You have to understand that their life is based around the group,” says Harold Juajibioy, a UNHCR staffer who works with the Awá. “When the armed conflict arrives in their lands the first thing that suffers is their sense of unity. It isn’t just a harming an individual, but harming a community.”

**“When the armed conflict arrives in their lands the first thing that suffers is their sense of unity.”**

In 2011 the Constitutional Court called for the adoption of precautionary measures to protect the group. And in April last year – after six years of internal displacement - 17 displaced Awá families were given 239 hectares of land by the government in the municipality of Villagarzon, in southern Colombia’s Putumayo region, to start over.

The resettled families, the first to be relocated there by the government, have gradually built elevated wooden shacks to live in. But their new homes lack running water, flushing toilets and electricity, and have black plastic trash bags covering most of the roofs to protect them from the heavy wet season rains.

“What does this Indigenous community need? Not just territory, we need housing, energy, water, running water in order to live, and livelihood projects so we can grow food. The government has really neglected us,” says Armando.

To get back on their feet, Armando says the community needs financial support to sow food crops and purchase cattle. “That is why it has been hard for us here. Some days we eat, other days we get by on a just a little coffee. That’s the situation we are living in,” he says.

While living conditions are hard, displacement for indigenous communities means more than just a loss of land. “Many times, out of fear or as a way to protect themselves, they don’t use their native language outside of their land,” says Juajibioy. “Because of discrimination in urban places, those cultural traditions, customs and rituals usually begin to disappear or deteriorate,” he adds.

While most of the homes in Villagarzon are not finished, one small but well-built wooden house stands in the middle of these lands. It is their cultural centre – built by the UN Refugee Agency - decorated and painted with the emblem of their planned indigenous reservation.   

A marimba - a percussion instrument built from bamboo – has been placed in the centre for the community to play. “We brought the marimba from Nariño,” says Armando, “The elders taught me to play it. And now I teach my sons, so that our culture can continue.”

The sun is setting and Ignacio Cuasaluzan has just come back from Mocoa, 18 kilometers Awáy. He made 25 thousand pesos in a long day’s work, the equivalent of US$8. It is just enough to pay for 12 kilos of rice which he will use to feed some members of his family. He joins his children to listen as Armando plays the marimba.

“We lived connected to nature,” he says wistfully. “We hear the birds sing and our marimba music complements the birdsong.”",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

**OCHA Director of Operations visited Ethiopia**

On 12-14 December 2017, Mr. John Ging, OCHA Director of Operations, visited Ethiopia to first-hand review the status of the Government-led international humanitarian response to drought and conflict-affected communities, including internally displaced people. The director met and discussed with the federal and regional Government of Ethiopia, donors, humanitarian agencies and communities affected by drought and conflict. Mr.Ging acknowledged the strong partnership the Government of Ethiopia has established over the years with the Humanitarian Country Team. He said that his visit is “a reflection of the importance of that partnership.”

The director visited Hamaressa IDP camp with over 4,000 people internally displaced by the Oromo-Somali inter-communal disputes. Following a briefing by the East Hararge zone administration about the scale of the crisis, Mr.Ging reassured authorities that he is committed to advocating for appropriate response to the crisis. The zonal authorities requested for urgent food and non-food assistance to IDPs East Hararge zone.  

Meanwhile subsequent intercommunal clashes were reported in West Hararge zone of Oromia region on the 12, 15 and 16 December resulting in more than 60 deaths. OCHA will continue to work with Government to verify access conditions and impact on humanitarian operations. Conflict has left close to 857,000 people displaced throughout the country.  

**Visit to Somali region**

During the meeting with the Somali Regional Government authorities, the region requested Mr.Ging’s advocacy support to scale up the ongoing response, particularly amidst the growing IDP needs and called for development investment in durable solutions for predictable pastoralist needs. The region also asked for the speedy implementation of cashbased assistance in all targeted woredas/districts. Mr. Ging and the Somali regional authorities discussed the need to improve accountability mechanisms, including quality needs assessment and information management.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

All that changed when the war happened and fighting started in her village. Suad and her family decided to leave all their belongings behind and flee; walking over 1,000km until they reached Idleb. They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent. Suad decided to borrow money from her neighbours and buy an old, second-hand sewing machine to bring in a little income.  

Learning about IOM’s Project from her husband, Suad applied and was soon accept- ed. “You can’t believe how happy I feel. I’ll be able to pay back the money I borrowed for the old sewing machine because it was quite a burden to us.” With the money she saved, she is able to support her family and buy medication for her sick husband. “I am getting closer to achieving my goal. I’ll work hard so I can take my kids from this tent to a decent apartment.  

My husband is buying fabric from the market for me to sew so he doesn’t have to work jobs that do not suit his health condition. We’ll work together toward our new goals and for our children’s future.”",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

The activities under Water and Sanitation will no longer be conducted as other actors in the country such as UNICEF and other UN agencies in coordination with the local authorities are covering these needs. The Emergency Appeal is currently being revised and these changes will be reflected. The revised Emergency Appeal will be focused in carrying out roof repairs in coordination with the local authorities.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

**A.2 Summary of current response**

**Overview of Host National Society**

4,225 volunteers are activated, of which 2,533 are from the operations and relief groups carrying out recovery work in the affected regions in sanitation and epidemic control including 531 volunteers working in the protection centres. The Restoring Family Link (RFL) office is working with 168 volunteers at the municipal level, in the 15 provinces and the central headquarters) with 1,161 volunteers

**Overview of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement in the country**

The IFRC continues providing support and coordination with the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) through its Country Cluster Support Team based in Dominican Republic, and through the Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) based in Panama. The Country Cluster Support Team and the regional disaster management coordinator (also emergency shelter focal point) are giving the support to all the response actions of this operation. The sectors and needs addressed by this Emergency Appeal were identified by the CRC in coordination with the government.

The Spanish Red Cross, who has had presence in the country, deployed one staff member to support the National Society’s response efforts. In addition, on the onset of the emergency and on 9 October, two staff members from the Canadian Red Cross Society were deployed to Cuba with the aim to contribute to the response requirements of the Cuban Red Cross.

The Cuban Red Cross coordinated bilaterally with the Spanish Red Cross, through its permanent cooperation program, a shipment of new clothes and footwear for adults, and psycho-pedagogical centres including children without subsidiary protection.

**Movement Coordination**

The Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) has been sharing official information from the CRC with all Movement members. The CRC led coordination meetings at country level with the Spanish Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Society.

Similarly, the necessary information mechanisms were established through the Partnerships and Resource Development (PRD) department.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2391544,"Soaring together to lead stabilization – A glimpse from Abu Kershola, South Kordofan “We had no communication and interaction with the locals. We did not have friends and could not trust each other” says Yagoub Ali, an IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) member in Abu Kershola. In a similar tone, El Nour Ahmed, a farmer in Abu Kershola, expresses “As a farmer, I faced frequent clashes with nomads whose cattle come to my farm grazing and destroy my crops regularly. I resorted to violence to show my power to the nomads and to convince them that I am able to protect my farm.  I was so angry that even when I was called several times by a committee of mediators to sit and negotiate to resolve this dispute, I refused.”

But things are changing for better in Abu Kershola, following a series of training on peacebuilding and conflict management, organization of peace forums & community dialogues, productivity in integrated farms, which are ran by the local Community Management Committees (CMCs) as well as the availability of water for drinking and irrigation from water yards. UNDP’s Community Security and Stabilization Programme (C2SP) brought this change, by establishing and training the CMCs, which also managed the water yards, among others.

Sharing his experience of working with CMCs, Yagoub Ali says “The CMCs facilitated interactions between us and people of Abu Kershola, they created work for us in the integrated farms; that helped us build bridge of trust with them. We now have a source of income as well as trustful relationship with brothers and sisters of Abu Kershola.” Farmer El Nour says “After I received training through the peacebuilding workshops and engaged in community dialogues organized by the CMC, I opted for peaceful negotiation with nomads because I realized that this cycle of violence is endless and there is nothing more important than to live our lives in peace.”

Abu Kershola locality, South Kordofan has suffered years of protracted conflict. Due to its proximity to Nuba mountains, the locality has witnessed regular attacks and intensive confrontations between warring parties’ troops resulting in large scale displacement of its Nuba population from Tagali group alongside groups of Arab and Fellata origin. As a direct consequence of the continued violence, traditional reconciliatory mechanisms were no longer working properly. In addition, mounting effects of climate change in the region had exacerbated the situation leading to deeper tensions between tribes in the locality.

UNDP’s innovative response to this crisis through the C2SP project was to establish CMCs comprising representatives of different ethnic groups, occupations and age groups and build its capacity in multiple sectors to address and prevent the impact of conflict. The handing over of power to people from various tribes living in the community while establishing ownership of the process and roles were crucial to lessen tensions over scarce land and water resources amongst existing communities as well as to alleviate pressure with arrival of new inhabitants.

This CMC model approach in the C2SP project, marks UNDP’s firm commitment towards stability, conflict prevention, and peace-building in the region.  UNDP works towards increasing the resilience of communities that are affected by conflict or are at higher risk of being drawn into conflict.  Placing vulnerable communities at the core who are likely to be drawn into larger conflict in the southern states of Sudan, C2SP supports the creation of alternative livelihoods opportunities; provision of socioeconomic infrastructure; capacitates communities on peacebuilding; and opportunities of reconciliation and social cohesion, anchored in the locally-owned CMC.  

The CMC members are made up of men, women and youth from different backgrounds representing diverse segments of selected target communities who work together in all aspects of the programme component thus enhancing tolerance between different tribes in the region. Apart from Abu Kershola, C2SP has targeted 6 other communities in South Kordofan - Debaibat, Abu Jubaiyah, Abassiya, Tilo, Hay Almark and Rashad. Since 2015, out of 93 targeted communities, this project has helped realize and create stability, resilience and social cohesion in 21 communities in six different states of Sudan.

C2SP supported the vulnerable communities in Abu Kershola locality through local NGO Sibro, and funding support from the Government of United Kingdom. In November 2017, DFID and UNDP, visited Abu Kershola to assess project progress and discuss challenges and how to better support community security, conflict prevention and development in the region. This was an important mission for people in Abu Kershola as it was the first visit by members of the international community in the last seven years.

During the visit, Abu Kershola CMC members expressed that they learnt new and different ways of mediation, problem solution, and dialogue from the C2SP peacebuilding training. They also collaborated with state peacebuilding mechanism who provided consultations and technical expertise and jointly organized planning and monitoring visits. They reported that, seven cases of conflict were successfully mediated during the course of C2SP intervention.

Thanks to funding from the United Kingdom government and their knowledge, C2SP continues to support stability, conflict prevention and development in the state focusing on unemployed youth with conflict carrying capacities, at-risk women, refugees, returnees and IDPs.

C2SP efforts have provided immediate results, as shared by CMCs during the visit: The CMCs prevented reoccurence of seven cases of conflict: three different inter-tribal conflicts and four farmers – pastoralists conflicts between 2016 and mid-2017. These conflicts did not escalate because of early interventions by CMCs. Each single time, the grievances were heard and resolved, with stability ensued. Ghada Elnour, an active female member of the CMC proudly expressed “Being a member of the CMC has given me a voice. This is so important to me and other women here. In the past, we were never part of the customary mediation process, but this situation is gradually changing. Due to the training in conflict resolution which we are receiving and the membership in the CMC, I am now proudly assisting in resolving emerging differences between groups and helping to prevent increase of tensions.” Youth representative of the CMC, Abaker Adam Belo added supportively, “Before C2SP intervention, there was little interaction amongst us – the young people in Abu Kershola, we used to meet only during the market day. However, we now come together and interact weekly through peace forums, in peace day celebrations, engage in the integrated farms, and community dialogue. This has helped us work collectively to consolidate unity in the community.”

However, for longer term peace in the region, more efforts need to be made on coordinated initiatives, like the CMC members. As DFID Sudan Conflict Advisor Ben Fisher who visited Abu Kershola notes in his blog “One significant obstacle however hinders the rebuilding of peace in South Kordofan. Access to big parts of the farming areas and pasture lands is restricted by mines and unexploded devices. This seriously limits the land use, both by pastoralists and farmers. Efforts are being made to coordinate with UN Mine Action to make the area safe from unexploded explosive ordinances (UXOs).” In the meantime, Abu Kershola inhabitants rise together through the C2SP supported CMCs to ensure that stability prevails in their area.

2391534,"Training Program Helps Nigerian Refugees in Cameroon **MINAWAO, CAMEROON** — Hundreds of Nigerian refugees who have fled the Boko Haram insurgency to the Minawao camp in northern Cameroon, now have the potential to become professional models after they were trained by the United Nations to be self-reliant and useful to themselves and their communities if they accept to voluntarily return. A majority of the carpenters and seamstresses are mothers.

Twenty-nine-year old Naomi Haman cuts wood with a hand saw to make a bench for the Minawao refugee camp school. The refugee who has been in the camp for two years, says in November 2017 she completed a six month training in carpentry.

""She came to be a carpenter so that sometimes even she goes to Nigeria, she can be able to make somethings like chairs or stools so that it can help her,"" says a Nigerian interpreter.

But Naomi's know-how is already useful and helping her to have some income. The mother of two who had depended on solely on her husband before he was killed by Boko Haram in Nigeria and continued depending on humanitarian assistance after fleeing to Cameroon, says she will receive about $ 5 when she completes and hands the bench to the refugee camp school that supplied the wood.

Just by Naomi's carpentry work shop, Theres Mami works on a sewing machine. The Cameroonian also benefits from the United Nations training program which has involved members of the host communities. Theres says she can now stitch torn dresses and be paid for her work.

She says their trainers started by drawing types of dresses on the board for them to identify and also draw and from there, they moved to various workshops where they were taught to stitch the items they were drawing.

The skills training project is part of UNHCR’s initiative to uphold the social and economic standing of refugees through education, vocational training, livelihoods promotion and self-reliance initiatives.

It encourages refugees and their hosts to interact to combat discrimination and reduce tensions and the scramble over already stretched natural resources.

Mamady Fata Kourouma, head of UNHCR in far northern Cameroon says the training will also be useful to the refugees when they voluntarily accept to return to Nigeria

He says to the UNHCR, training the refugees to be self-reliant is like giving them hope and making them independent and useful to themselves, their families and communities. He says they expect the refugees who are now professionals to continue convincing and training others who are just idling around the camp so that they can be useful and not a burden when they return to their country.

Sixty percent of the Nigerians enrolled in the training are women. They say they will need financial assistance from the U.N. and the Nigerian government to be able to set up businesses when they return.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

The announcement was made by the Deputy Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (DSRCC) for Somalia, Simon Mulongo, in a meeting with a section of youth leaders held in Mogadishu today.

Mr. Mulongo said the African Union mission will offer training and work closely with partners to develop structures that will enable young people exploit their talents and prepare them for leadership.

“As AMISOM, we capacitate the youth through breaking down the negative forces and to create an enabling and stable environment for the youth to operate freely and thrive. We also support initiatives to protect the youth from extreme fundamentalism in addition to the continuous training and capacity building,” the DSRCC stated.

Mr. Mulongo was responding to requests for support made the youth leaders who also took him through the challenges young people face in Somalia.

Led by Member of Parliament Abdufatah Kasim Mohamud and Abdikaafi Mohamud Makaran, the Chairperson of the National Youth Council, the youth also discussed ways and means AMISOM could offer its support.

Mr. Makaran noted that youth leaders hope to effectively utilize various opportunities, next year, to help bring positive change in the lives of young people.

“The mindset of the youths has now changed; more youths are willing to work hard. We need to focus on awareness creation, building cohesion and unity among youth as well as creating jobs. 2018 is a year in which we want to see change for the youth, tackling unemployment and enabling development,” he stated.

His remarks were echoed by Mr. Mohamud who said youth members of parliament will establish a youth caucus to advocate for policies and legislation that support youth interests.

He appealed for training of youth MPs to help them acquire skills and knowledge needed to effectively champion the rights of young people.

“Beyond building infrastructure, we need to educate the youths and equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills. Most of the victims of Al-Shabaab are youths and we need to empower them to take the lead in the security sector, in development initiatives and in civil society endeavors,” the MP said.

The Deputy SRCC commended efforts made by the youth in the improvement of peace and security in the country. He challenged them to establish proper organizational structures to effectively utilize emerging opportunities for growth.

“As young people, you are very energetic and passionate. That energy and drive must however be harnessed and driven in the right direction for you to effectively utilize your youthfulness,” Mr.  Mulongo observed.

The DSRCC further noted that youths remain vulnerable to exploitation into acts of violent extremism, hence the need for awareness creation and empowerment.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

**Protection and Return Support**

**Return Management**

■ The Government of Kenya have now authorized resumption of road convoys to Somalia but due to rainfalls in the region (Dhobley town, Lower Juba region), most of the return routes are not accessible, making return by road not feasible.

■ Flights to Kismayo have resumed on 21 November. The suspension was put in place on 28 September after the State of Jubaland imposed new landing fees on UN flights. The last return flight from Kenya to Kismayo was received on 28 September.

**Protection Monitoring**

■ UNHCR has shared the Country of Origin Information (COI) for the month of October with the Return Help Desk in Refugee Camps in Kenya and Yemen. The COI includes information about the humanitarian, security and political situation in Somalia. The COI helps Somali refugees make an informed decision about their return.

■ During November, the pilot phase of UNHCR’s new post-returns monitoring system commenced across South Central Somalia. Consultations were held with partners in Mogadishu before the rollout of the telephonic monitoring began. The new monitoring system includes a face-to-face survey.

- On 6 December, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres said following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that, “Jerusalem  is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides”. To read the full statement, please click here.

- For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which has further undermined an already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 2017 in the context of disputes between the de-facto authorities in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely impacted the availability of essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and has undermined Gaza’s fragile economy, especially the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. In the already impoverished Gaza Strip, residents have learned to adapt to the fact that electricity is only available for between two and four hours a day. The shortages have defined how people live their lives: getting up in the middle of the night if there is power to run washing machines or turn on water pumps. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory, electricity blackouts in Gaza last between 19-21 hours each day. Families in Gaza are forced to spend a large part of their income on energy, whether on the meagre supply of electricity they receive through high voltage lines, or on the cost of fuel, generators and their repair.

- A ceremony to mark the International Day of Human Rights was organized by the UNRWA Field Education Programme at Beach Preparatory Girls School A in Beach camp, western Gaza city, on 11 December. The Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, and other senior UNRWA staff as well as teachers, students and their parents attended the event. The event included activities such as songs, sketches and a drawing competition for the students. The parents also participated in an activity where they shared their views on gender equality and non-discrimination in the Gaza Strip, wishing for a better future for all. For over ten years UNRWA has been integrating human rights, conflict resolution and tolerance in its school activities. In May 2012, the Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA.

- An online lecture with the Japanese Research Syowa Station in Antarctica was conducted via Skype to a group of 30 students from two UNRWA schools on 11 December 2017. Dr. Hirofumi Oe, the station’s medical doctor, introduced the life in Antarctica and the mission of the research station to the students. The lecture lasted for two hours and included a presentation with photos and videos followed by an open discussion during which the students raised a number of questions such as the impact of climate change on the world, and Antarctica in particular. Commenting on the lecture, Dr. Hirofumi expressed his pleasure in speaking with UNRWA students in Gaza, explaining the environment of Antarctica, and the purpose and activities of the Japanese research mission there. The lecture was a great opportunity to widen both the knowledge and horizon of students in Gaza. Freedom of movement outside Gaza is virtually non-existent due to the blockade; 90 per cent of the over 271,900 students from UNRWA schools have never left the Gaza Strip in their lives. The UNRWA Education Programme recognizes the critical need for students to understand and connect with the world, and hence always seeks to implement innovative projects through which refugee students can link to, and share knowledge and ideas with, their peers and others in the rest of the world.

- UNRWA in Gaza celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 4 December 2017. The ceremony took place at the UNRWA Gaza Field Office compound and was attended by UNRWA Director of Operations, Mr. Matthias Schmale, Chief of the Field Relief and Social Services Programme, Mr. Asem Abu Shawish, UNRWA senior staff as well as heads of community rehabilitation centres that provide support to persons with disabilities across the Gaza Strip. The ceremony included speeches by Mr. Schmale, representatives from the coordination committee of the community rehabilitation centres, and a representative of persons with disabilities. It also included many uplifting performances by children with disabilities. The disability sub-programme of the UNRWA Relief and Social Services Programme provides various forms of support to people with disabilities and assists vulnerable groups of Palestine refugees through community social interventions. It conducts activities through 19 Community-Based Organizations, 7 Women’s Programme Centres, 7 Community-Based Rehabilitation Centres for persons with disabilities and 5 Youth Activity Centres.

- During the reporting period, as part of his regular outreach visits, the Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, visited Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, and Gaza City. During the visit to Khan Younis camp, the Director met with a beneficiary family receiving Social Safety Net support due to their extreme poverty and visited UNRWA Abu Teama Preparatory Co-ed school. In his visit to Gaza city, Mr. Schmale met with members of the School Parliament and their teachers at the UNRWA Gaza Preparatory Girls A, and then proceeded to Tuffah Distribution Centre, a Community-Based Rehabilitation Centre and the Sheikh Radwan Health Centre. The visit was followed by a meeting with UNRWA Health Programme senior staff in which the Chief of the Field Health Programme, Dr. Ghada Al-Jadba, highlighted the programme’s achievements and challenges in 2017.

**UNRWA’S RESPONSE**

**THE UNRWA JOB CREATION PROGRAMME: PROVIDING A SOURCE OF INCOME AND STRENGTHENING SELF-RELIANCE**

The blockade of Gaza entered its 11th year in June 2017. The heavy restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza , in addition to the three consecutive conflicts and the internal political divide, have not only crushed the enclave’s formerly trade-based economy, they are also heavily responsible for the sky-rocketing unemployment rates. Extreme poverty, food insecurity and confinement contribute to depression, and hopelessness. According to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in Gaza was at 46.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.Even more dramatically, 71 per cent of females in Gaza are reportedly unemployed.
Through the UNRWA Job Creation Programme (JCP), the Agency works to mitigate the impact of the collapsed economy and labour market in Gaza by providing livelihood opportunities for Palestine refugees.

41-year-old Palestine refugee Enshirah Al-Batah, who lives with her nine-member family in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza Strip, received a three-month work opportunity as a labourer in an agriculture project in Beit Lahia as part of UNRWA’s JCP activities.

“I applied for a position in the UNRWA Job Creation Programme seven years ago. I felt blessed and happy when UNRWA called to inform me that I got a three-month job opportunity. Every morning I go to work with my colleagues and start my work with hope and passion. We pick and package strawberries and prepare them for possible export,” Enshirah said.

The programme targets both skilled and unskilled workers as well as professionals. Priority is given to applicants from households who have been assessed as living below the poverty line of less than US$ 3.87 per person per day; other criteria are gender, age, skills, or location. UNRWA aims to provide 40 per cent of skilled opportunities to women and 40 per cent of all job opportunities to youth. UNRWA also offers thousands of opportunities for graduates from Gaza universities through its Graduate Training Programme.

“This is my first paid job ever. Due to my family’s difficult economic conditions, I received little education. I can hardly read and write so it’s not easy to find a job. At the beginning, it was hard to adapt with the new routine, but now I can’t wait until morning comes to see my friends. I feel more confident and productive,” Enshirah added.

The Job Creation Programme provides not only a source of income, but also helps to restore self-respect, dignity and some form of self-reliance to thousands of Palestine refugees. The money earned through short-term job opportunities is mostly spent to cover basic needs such as medicine, fresh food, or clothes.

“I use the money I gain to repay my family debts and pay for my daughter’s college tuition. My dreams and hopes are simple. I dream of having a stable source of income,” Enshirah added.

In the first nine months of 2017, UNRWA created job opportunities for 16,515 beneficiaries, injecting US$ 12.4 million into the Gaza economy. To address high levels of youth unemployment in Gaza, a sub-component of the JCP – the Graduate Training Programme – offered 2,799 (out of the total of 16,515 jobs) opportunities to recent graduates in 2017 to date.

**FUNDING NEEDS**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget in 2017. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

Following the 2014 conflict, US$ 316 million has been pledged in support of UNRWA’s emergency shelter programme, for which an estimated US$ 720 million is required. This leaves a current shortfall of US$ 404 million. UNRWA urgently appeals to donors to generously contribute to its emergency shelter programme to provide displaced Palestine refugees in Gaza with rental subsidies or cash assistance to undertake reconstruction of their demolished homes.

As presented in UNRWA’s occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) Emergency Appeal for 2017, the Agency is seeking US$ 402 million to meet the minimum humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees in the oPt. The Gaza portion of the Emergency Appeal amounts to US$ 355 million for 2017, to address protracted, large scale humanitarian needs. More information can be found [here](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/emergency-appeals/opt-emergency-appeal-2017).

**CROSSINGS**

Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have undermined the living conditions of 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, Erez crossing and Kerem Shalom crossing. Rafah crossing is controlled by the Egyptian authorities and technically allows for the movement of a number of authorized travelers, Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases only. Erez crossing is controlled by Israeli authorities and technically allows for the movement of aid workers and limited numbers of authorized travelers, including Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases. Kerem Shalom crossing, also controlled by Israeli authorities, technically allows for the movement of authorized goods only.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)). In 2017, these conditions have led several countries to be on the brink of famine.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

2390649,"The European Union donates an additional EUR 10.5 million to UNRWA at a crucial time for Palestine refugees The European Union (EU) has announced an additional, vital contribution of EUR 10.5 million to the 2017 Programme Budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), in support of education, access to health care, employment opportunities, and improved living conditions for millions of Palestine refugees.

This donation complements nearly five decades of steadfast EU support of Palestine refugees. This year, in particular, the European Union and UNRWA have launched the unique _Healthy Living, Healthy Spaces_ (HLHS) campaign, targeting 50 EU-sponsored UNRWA schools and 15 health centers for repair and rehabilitation across Lebanon, Gaza, West Bank and Jordan fields. Both [the HLHS initiative](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-and-eu-celebrate-launch-project-improve-unrwa-health-and-educational) and latest contribution stand as a testament to the strong EU and UNRWA partnership for Palestine refugees.

In recognition of the contribution, Pierre Krähenbühl, UNRWA Commissioner-General, stated: “Giving some half million students in UNRWA schools across the Middle East a sense of dignity and preserving their opportunities is particularly urgent at a time when the spaces in which they can develop and enjoy a normal childhood are shrinking so dramatically. This is particularly important in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in Gaza and in Syria. In these contexts, the support we receive from the EU is of critical significance.”

""With this contribution, the EU support to the regular UNRWA budget in 2017 has reached EUR 102 million. This support allows millions of Palestine refugees to receive access to education, health and other social services. These services are crucial for sustaining hope amid a tough reality,"" said EU Representative Ralph Tarraf. ""In its five fields of operations, UNRWA is contributing to stability in the face of enormous new challenges. The EU will continue to support this effort until a just and agreed-upon solution is found for Palestine refugees. This is an essential element of the EU strategy to maintain peace in the region,"" he added. 

The European Union is the Agency’s largest multi-lateral donor, with an overall yearly contribution amounting to 12.5 per cent of the total programme support. This latest donation brings the EU contributions to EUR 102 million for 2017, including EUR 82 million disbursed earlier in the year and the additional contribution of EUR 9.5 million announced this past September.

**EU AND UNRWA: TOGETHER FOR PALESTINE REFUGEES**

Since 1971, the European Union and UNRWA have maintained a strategic partnership governed by the shared objective to support the human development, humanitarian and protection needs of Palestine refugees and promote stability in the Middle East. Today, the European Union is the largest multilateral provider of international assistance to Palestine refugees. This reliable and predictable support from the European Union enables UNRWA to provide core services to more than 5 million Palestine refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, including quality education for roughly half a million children and primary health care for more than 3.5 million patients.

Collectively, the EU and its Member States are also among the largest contributors to the Agency’s humanitarian emergency appeals and projects in response to various crises and specific needs across the region. The partnership between the European Union and UNRWA has allowed millions of Palestine refugees to be better educated, live healthier lives, access employment opportunities and improve their living conditions, thus contributing to the development of the entire region.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. As a result, the UNRWA Programme Budget, which supports the delivery of core essential services, operates with a large shortfall. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

UNRWA is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees. Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight. UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection and microfinance.

2390594,"South Africa: Empowering women at JRS Arrupe Centres Johannesburg, 22 December 2017 – In South Africa, host to one of the largest populations of urban refugees in the world, the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) runs two centres for women refugees and asylum seekers. The centres, in Pretoria and Johannesburg, are named of JRS’s founder, Fr Pedro Arrupe SJ, and run projects that empower women with applicable vocational skills.

The life skills training courses offered at the Arrupe Centres range from English language to baking.  Once students complete their courses, they are given start-up kits and the opportunity to attend a business training seminar, where they learn how to use their newly acquired skills to generate income for themselves and their families.

As part of the final project before graduation, tailoring students in Pretoria must complete entire outfits.

Teaching beneficiaries how to work with fondant icing has been an important addition to the baking courses, as this particular technique enables many women to secure jobs as birthday and wedding cake bakers after graduation. 

Of all the courses, the cosmetology and hairdressing classes have proved to be especially successful in helping women gain generate income. 

“In order for these refugee women to successfully rebuild their lives in the urban settings of South Africa, skills training…and in some cases retraining in skills that are relevant, is key to their healthy integration.” says Jill Drzewiecki, JRS International’s Campaign and Philanthropy Officer. 

The opportunity to learn relevant and applicable skills is essential for female refugees living in protracted situations of displacement, especially in urban contexts; the JRS Arrupe Centres are proud to contribute to empowering women to be changemakers in their families and communities through financial security.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

2390024,"North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, November 2017 **Operational Overview**

The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains severe due to ongoing conflict, continued internal displacement and the unpredictable return of refugees from neighbouring countries. New population movements continued to be recorded in November, with 1,862 new arrivals in Gwoza, followed by 729 in Askira/Uba, 428 in Mafa, 373 in Ngala and 358 in Madagali; Jere and Chibok recorded relatively high numbers of departures. Additionally, recent important and unexpected arrivals of population (over 13,000 persons) were recorded in Nganzai, Konduga and Magumeri where there is very limited partner presence due to insecurity and lack of access. Humanitarian agencies mobilised to address to the most urgent needs, in particular through the rapid response mechanism (RRM), filling the most pressing gaps until sectors can plan and deliver a comprehensive response.  

While food security has improved throughout the north-east in 2017 as a result of a massive scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihoods assistance, the situation remains extremely fragile with many households, particularly in Borno State, mainly dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic food and livelihood needs. Many remain forced to resort to negative coping strategies to access food. The most recent Cadre Harmonisé analysis (finalised in November) projects that, without adequate and timely humanitarian assistance, 3.7 million individuals will be facing critical levels of food insecurity during the 2018 lean season (June through September). The figure does not include four Borno State local government areas (LGAs) where data could not be collected due to access constraints (in Abadam, Guzamala and Marte) or lack of partner capacity (in Kala/Balge).  

In addition to food insecurity, issues of protection continue to cause extremely serious concern throughout the north-east, including person-borne explosive device attacks in or near IDP camps, and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of internally displaced persons (IDPs) by those supposed to protect them, as was reported in Bama (Borno State). In addition, on 1 November, four pupils in a primary school in Kwaya Kusar, Borno State, were gruesomely attacked. Two of them died and the other two were severely wounded. This direct attack against an educational institution, the first one in two years, may impact school attendance as parents may fear for their children’s lives. In addition, following the resurgence of attacks by non-state armed groups in some parts of Adamawa State, 12 primary schools have been closed, affecting education continuity for the children enrolled in those schools.  

The dry season has also allowed the work on ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs to accelerate and, to date, five out of the nine planned hubs are complete (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza). Another four (Monguno, Damasak, Banki and Rann) are expected to be fully operational by early 2018. As these hubs offer secure accommodation and Internet connectivity for aid workers, they are instrumental in supporting effective last-mile aid delivery and enhancing local coordination.  

With close to 70 per cent (US$731 million out of $1.05 billion) of the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) funding requirements received before year-end, the humanitarian response in Nigeria is one of the world’s best funded. Thanks to the generous support of donors, many sectors have been able to meet their targets on key life-saving activities. However, a critical gap remained throughout the year in the funding of the Response and Recovery Planning sector. This has hampered the humanitarian agencies’ ability to deliver comprehensive livelihood support to affected people, has slowed down debris removal activities in major towns, and overall limited early recovery work across north-east Nigeria.  

As the year draws to a close, sectors and humanitarian organisations continued to carry out various programme-based and areabased needs assessments which are contributing to drafting the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan, to be finalised respectively by mid-December and early January.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

2389534,"Germany Contributes EUR 23.15 Million to UNRWA for Projects in Gaza 22 December 2017

On 8 and 13 December 2017, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) signed two agreements with the German Development Bank (KfW) totaling EUR 23.15 million from the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

As part of the overall contribution, EUR 18.15 million will be allocated to the UNRWA reconstruction programme in Gaza, allowing the safe and dignified return of some 540 Palestine refugee families to their houses that were completely destroyed during the hostilities in the summer of 2014. Reaffirming Germany’s strong commitment to support Palestinian refugees in Gaza, this grant builds on earlier contributions in the amount of EUR 57 Million by the German Federal Government towards the UNRWA emergency shelter and reconstruction programme since 2014.

An additional EUR 5 million will be used for the construction and expansion of two UNRWA schools in the Gaza Strip which will benefit around 6,000 students. Two schools will be constructed using the completely renewed, innovative, child-friendly UNRWA school design and will significantly enhance education for thousands of children over the coming years. In total, UNRWA operates 267 schools in Gaza, providing primary education to a steadily increasing student population of now over 262,000 refugee children.

The German Representative in Ramallah, Mr. Peter Beerwerth, welcomed the additional funding: “With this substantial contribution to the UNRWA reconstruction programme in Gaza, Germany is continuing its support to Palestine refugees. 540 families will be able to rebuild their completely destroyed houses.

As education is of utmost importance to Germany, we are contributing an additional EUR 5 million to UNRWA schools in Gaza. With this German support, thousands of students will profit from an enhanced and safer learning environment,” he added.

“We highly value this generous contribution and the commitment of the Federal Republic of Germany to support the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip and the work of UNRWA work which will bring the response to reconstruction needs resulting from the massive destruction caused in 2014 a significant step towards completion. We are also very much appreciate the support from the BMZ and the KfW to build schools that will enable us to continue to provide quality education for Palestine refugees’ children in Gaza,” stated Mr. Matthias Schmale, Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza.

These additional contributions further extend the significant support that the German Federal Government is rendering towards Palestine refugees in Gaza. Germany continues to support UNRWA in the fields of humanitarian assistance, employment creation, infrastructure, reconstruction and rehabilitation. The new contributions are implemented through the state-owned development bank KfW.

In 2016, Germany was the Agency’s fourth largest donor, having contributed EUR 67,534,343 (USD 73,627,810) to UNRWA. Germany has been a member of the UNRWA Advisory Commission since 2005.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**  
UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. As a result, the UNRWA Programme Budget, which supports the delivery of core essential services, operates with a large shortfall. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

UNRWA is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees. Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight. UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection and microfinance.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2388324,"Syria: Complex Emergency appeal operations update n°MDRSY003  Operations update n°14 This operations update provides a summary of key results achieved against objectives of the IFRC Syria Complex Emergency Appeal from 01 January 2017 until November 2017. As of October 2017, the number of people in Syria affected by the crisis, in urgent need of humanitarian assistance is still more than 13 million. 

This Operations Update extends the timeframe of of the Emergency Appeal (MDRSY003) until 31 December 2018 in order to continue supporting the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) in providing life- saving assistance to conflict-affected people in Syria. 

The plan and budget for the Emergency Appeal will be revised in the first quarter of 2018, based on a comprehensive review of the operation that will begin in January. The review will analyse the relevance, effectiveness and overall quality of the Emergency Appeal response to date, consider lessons learned and provide a roadmap for the future of IFRC support for the coming years. 

The 2017 operational budget of CHF 49.7 million is 72% funded, thanks to the continued efforts of the IFRC partners. Yet, the IFRC Syria operational plan and budget have a significant funding gap of CHF 13.9 million for objectives that remain highly relevant in 2018, and are in line with SARC’s priorities for response, recovery and the requisite institutional capacity. 

With this 12-month extension, IFRC will continue to mobilize resources towards the targets outlined in the current plan and budget. Current urgent funding priorities are to secure an ongoing supply of relief contingency stocks, medical stocks, and sustained capacity of the IFRC Syria office structure in 2018.   
 
Partners are encouraged to make funding commitments for the 2018 period, and contribute towards the immediate funding priorities to facilitate a timely procurement and operational priorities towards the beginning of 2018 2017 was characterized by institutional and operational reorganization for both the IFRC Syria office and for SARC. IFRC adjusted its strategies and operational approaches to overcome the challenges with the import of relief and medical stocks which continued from 2016 hindering the IFRC implementation levels during the first months of 2017. Positive outcomes mid-2017 continue to boost operational progress in the second half of the year.

2388279,"UNICEF Syria Crisis Situation Report (Humanitarian Results) - November 2017 **Highlights**

- As of 18 December 2017, the UNICEF 2017/18 winter response in Syria and Syrian refugee host countries reached over 630,000 children but remains 58% underfunded (out of US$72 million appeal) and 880,000 children remain in dire need for support.

- In Syria, the escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta and limited access of humanitarian deliveries and commercial goods has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, half of them children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since January 2017. In the same month, UNICEF reached more than 340,000 people in hard-to-reach locations (including 27,000 people in besieged locations) with life-saving interventions and critical services in the areas of WASH, education, health and nutrition and child protection.

- In November in Turkey, over 167,000 Syrian refugee children benefitted from the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education (CCTE) for attending school regularly in preceding months, a nearly 22% increase in beneficiaries over the previous payment in September. Approximately 82% of children receiving the CCTE in November also benefitted from the Emergency Social Safety Net programme, which helped reach close to 1.1 million refugees to date.

- In Lebanon, UNICEF WASH response to 190,000 people living in informal settlements (population of 272,000) is facing a critical funding shortage of US$ 26.5 million to sustain services beyond April 2018. To pre-empt the funding shortfall, a shift from full service coverage is being undertaken to mainly focus on the most vulnerable, semi-temporary costeffective water and wastewater facilities, and the establishment of a surveillance mechanism to identify possible communicable disease outbreak and trigger an immediate Health and WASH joint response.

- The number of unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) in Egypt has increased to nearly 2,500 in 2017 compared to 1,800 last year including some Syrian refugees. Key needs identified for this highly vulnerable group include legal documentation, legal support, cash assistance, education and child protection services. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs:** Humanitarian needs remained critical in Syria throughout November. Though the overall level of violence decreased in some areas of the country (primarily those linked to de-escalation zones in southern Syria, northern Homs), violence escalated and or remained high elsewhere such as in Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Raqqa and Deir-Ez-Zour where fighting and anti-ISIL operations continue to inflict high civilian casualties. The escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta along with limited access of humanitarian and commercial shipments has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, especially children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since the last survey conducted in January 20171 . 

Furthermore, fighting between armed opposition groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Nour al-Din al-Zenki (NDZ) led to the disruption of humanitarian services in western rural Aleppo. Some humanitarian services were suspended from November 14 to 18 over concerns for the security of staff. Clashes between non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and the Government of Syria resulted in shelling in southern rural Aleppo, triggering a displacement of more than 10,000 residents and 2,600 internally displaced people (IDPs)2 . 

A rise in military clashes led to a displacement of more than 90,000 IDPs from As-Saan, Hamra and Oqierbat in Hama governorate and Tamanah in southern Idleb to move northward into Idleb governorate in the past two months.3 In Raqqa, displaced populations are returning to areas with a high prevalence of unexploded ordinances and landmines. Humanitarian partners estimate more than 200 related trauma cases since cessation of military activities in Raqqa City, particularly among children, highlighting the importance of scalingup life-saving mine risk education in prior active conflict zones. The destruction of education and health4 infrastructure along with further attacks and internal displacement continues to limit access to these essential services for children throughout the country. Subsequently, an estimated 1.7 million children remain out-of-school and 200,000 others have missed-out on basic immunization and polio. 

In total, Jordan now hosts 2.7 million refugees, including 655,588 registered Syrian refugees (51 per cent children)5 . A population of approximately 40,000 Syrians remain along Jordan’s northeast desert border near Rukban, of whom 80 per cent are estimated to be women and children, with a significant percentage of households headed by females. Since the closure of the border in June 2016, only modest support has been possible from the Jordanian side of the berm, including the provision of safe water and access to basic health services, primarily through the UN and in close coordination with the Jordanian Armed Forces. The UNICEF-supported clinic near Rukban has provided around 500 medical consultations in November, a decrease from services provided in the previous month (1,002 consultations) due to limited access. The daily provision of safe water by UNICEF and access to some health services remain the only regular humanitarian assistance available for the vulnerable population at the Berm. 

Reports of minor clashes between Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) armed forces (Peshmerga), Iraq Security Forces (ISF) and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) continued in the reporting month, albeit no significant displacement. As in the previous month, armed conflict remained largely far from Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) areas where Syrian refugees reside. There has been no resolution to ongoing political tension between the KRG in Erbil and the federal Government of Iraq since the referendum on the former’s independence in September, however political dialogue is ongoing. As of November, Iraq is hosting 246,974 registered Syrian refugees including over 107,187 children 6 . Although overall numbers have remained largely static, movements continue between Syria and Iraq at the Peshkhabour border crossing. Per information received from border authorities, some 5,100 Syrians arrived in the KRI in September alone, of these, more than 3,800 were readmittances after prior authorization by border authorities to return to Syria.7 The humanitarian situation of Syrian refugees in Iraq has remained largely the same throughout 2017. With around 40 per cent of Syrian refugees under 18, the need for access to formal education remains high. Although Syrian refugees in camps remain well served, Syrian refugees in host communities may not have regular access to primary healthcare, regular safe water supply or adequate sanitation. In this prolonged refugee crisis, there is need to identify and strengthen community-based child protection networks to identify child protection issues and advocate for child-focused solutions. 

Lebanon continues to host an estimated 1.5 million refugees (over one million registered with UNHCR8 ). The sudden resignation of the Prime Minister Saad Hariri on 4 November heightened the sense of an impending crisis. While the situation normalized with his return to Lebanon, the incident exposed a precarious political context and its potential impact on the region. UNICEF continues to face critical funding shortages in Informal Settlements (US$26.5 million gap) to meet the needs of 190,000 people (estimated population of 272,000) for WASH as well as for Health (US$ 2.8 million gap). Given the expected decrease in humanitarian funding next year, UNICEF is transitioning towards strategic and longer-term systems strengthening in the areas of the No Lost Generation initiatives (child protection, youth, education and social protection) as well as child survival (health and WASH), while maintaining a more durable humanitarian response in light of ongoing needs and current instability.  
In November, nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, including over 1.5 million children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.9 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, 2,052 refugees and migrants were rescued or apprehended on their sea journey from Turkey to Greece, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece. Under the framework of the EU-Turkey Statement, seven rounds of returns took place for 75 people in November (including two accompanied children)10, bringing the total number of readmissions to 1,469 since the Statement came into effect in March 2016. 

In Egypt, the total number of registered Syrian refugees and asylum seekers has reached over 124,000, an increase from the 117,591 registered in January 2017. Forty per cent of new Syrian arrivals are coming illegally from the Sudanese border leading to an increased number of detentions. UNICEF has access to the 23 detention centres where it provides health assistance, including vaccines, hygiene kits and non-food items, with a focus on young and adolescent girls. 

The Government of Egypt grants Syrian refugee children access to education in public schools under the same rules and regulations that apply to Egyptian nationals. However, absorbing the number of Syrian students in public schools is a persistent constraint due to high class density and limited number of teachers relative to students. Other challenges to enrolment include strict documentation requirements, safety measures (inside and outside classrooms) and lack of quality teaching in public schools. Currently, an estimated 39,000 children remain out-of-school. The number of unaccompanied and separated children has increased to about 2,50011 compared to 1,800 last year. Key needs include issuance of legal documentation to help qualify for legal support and cash assistance, in addition to education, child protection services.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2388154,"To Help Refugees, Help the Whole Community by Sean Carroll

On a recent trip to Lebanon, my first to the region as the new head of ANERA, I met with a group of youth. Two were Syrian refugees, one a Palestinian refugee from Syria (a refugee twice over), one a Palestinian refugee who’s grown up in Lebanon, and one a Lebanese. Though their stories and backgrounds are different, all of them are vulnerable, living precarious lives, with many of the same challenges. In Lebanon, though, there is a definite pecking order. “It is so upsetting that the dirtiest word now is refugee,” said Alaa, the young Palestinian whose family was splintered by war, with some dead, some still in Syria, one in Europe and the rest now in Lebanon. “What is most upsetting is, we didn’t choose this, it isn’t our doing.”

Alla had learned to play three instruments, and studied two languages, and was a teacher in Syria. Now, like many fellow refugees from Syria, she describes not only the loss of her previous life and dreams, but discrimination from the host Lebanese communities and also from fellow Palestinians who, in her words, “deny a common heritage” and label her Syrian, as an intended insult.

Alla was one of many young refugees I met who even after their homes and lives crumbled around them, now often find doors shut to them on their search for a normal, productive life. And, now, a new political crisis in the country used as a proxy by many, and created by forces inside and outside, has all residents of Lebanon on edge. Many, myself included, fear a potential setback to development among refugee and vulnerable host communities.

**How to Help Refugees with Limited Resources**

The Syrian war has hit no country harder than Lebanon, a small nation where now more than one in four people is a refugee. Over [1 million Syrians](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122) fleeing civil war over the past six years have joined [450,000 Palestinians](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon) who have lived in Lebanon for generations. Imagine the equivalent in the U.S.—the population rapidly swelling to over 400 million, with more than 80 million refugees. Nearly half the world’s 22.5 million refugees are Palestinian or Syrian, and about one of every seven of them now live, temporarily or permanently, in Lebanon. As elsewhere, refugees in Lebanon face poverty, institutionalized discrimination, and, as tensions mount between refugees and their hosts, continuing threats to their security. Not surprisingly, many in the Lebanese host communities also struggle.

[Economic growth has slowed considerably](http://www.hespress.com/international/348606.html) in the past few years, and unemployment rates have risen, especially among [Lebanese youth.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS?locations=LB) Though only about 20 percent of the Syrian refugees are working-age men, some Lebanese youth feel they have been “[driven out of the labor market](http://daleel-madani.org/sites/default/files/ANERA_Youth%20at%20Risk%20in%20Lebanon-Final.pdf)” by refugees who work for less pay. Meanwhile, Syrians and Palestinians are legally relegated to menial labor and thus face difficulties of their own. Social tension is particularly acute in Bekaa and Akkar—rural regions with the highest number of refugees and host populations that compete for jobs in agriculture and construction.

So, with development needs present and overlapping among Syrians, Palestinians and Lebanese, we integrate all vulnerable communities into our development work in the country. Whether in [education, sports, youth community organizing, or vocational training.](https://www.anera.org/priorities/job-skills-training/) ANERA’s programs don’t discriminate. All are welcome.

**Youth Come Together in Class**

In Saida, near Ein El Hilweh Camp, where I met the group of youth, one of the others was a young Lebanese woman, 25-year-old Dina. She was a teenage bride who was forced to drop out of school in sixth grade because her then-husband disapproved of women being educated. After having a child, getting divorced, and missing many years of school, she enrolled in ANERA’s X-ray technician course, one of a variety of job skill offerings throughout the country. Now, she’s doing an internship at Al Na’eeb Hospital that will soon turn into a full-time position.

Dina sat beside Omar, a [Syrian refugee of Palestinian descent.](https://www.anera.org/stories/dancing-dabke-syrian-refugee-camps/) They are about the same age but face different circumstances. The Syrian war took a toll on Omar’s outlook on life, and he became introverted and dropped out of school, even though he was once the top of his class in Syria. Stuck in [Ein El Hilweh](https://www.anera.org/stories/ein-el-hilweh-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon/) with little to do, he thought he might join a dabke dance class to have a bit of fun. But the trainer quickly dismissed him—he was told he couldn’t dance.

“I took this as a personal challenge and decided to practice to prove it to myself,” he told me. He’s gotten so good at dabke that he’s teaching one of our dance classes in the camp. He also enrolled in a photography course and found a new passion, and the potential for paid work. Because he couldn’t afford a camera on his own, we are giving him one as part of a graduation kit so he can earn a living as a wedding photographer.

With a majority of the refugee population [under the age of 25,](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/dp029_en_2.pdf) our work focuses on youth, and on supporting youth-led initiatives. On my trip I was moved by the innovative projects young people have taken up—from making toys, crafts and furniture out of recycled materials, to growing gardens in the narrow, dank alleys of refugee camps, to replacing hazardous electrical wiring hanging over the streets with solar-powered lamps that improve security.

**Community-Based Initiatives Take Off**

In response to Lebanon’s trash crisis, which made headlines in 2015, and continues to this day, ANERA works with youth and other civic and municipal leaders from host and refugee communities to lead a pilot project in [solid waste management](https://www.anera.org/stories/how-refugee-camp-recycling-project-improves-livelihoods/) in villages and camps. Focused on reducing, reusing and recycling solid waste, and through successful outreach campaigns and community organizing, the project [garnered national attention.](http://www.addiyar.com/article/1446763-%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%AD%D8%A7) It was so successful in the northern Lebanese town of Mashha—where half the residents are refugees—that 80 percent of residents participate. Neighboring towns are joining to solve their ongoing trash crisis and scale up the model.

In all of these instances, development success comes when we work with the whole community, not just one sect or segment, refugees or residents. In opening doors for the displaced to opportunities for dignity, normalcy, and income security, those doors must not swing against the aspirations of the young and vulnerable among their host communities. Fortunately, we have good models and successful impact, integrating work across sectors and among different communities. Let us all encourage and build on an environment that allows for this integrated, community-led approach, rather than a return to increased sectarianism. Let us recognize and respond to differences in obstacles and aspirations – not in nationalities, sects or status.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2388139,"USAID in Afghanistan: Challenges and Successes BY: William Hammink

For nearly sixteen years in Afghanistan, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has sought to deliver effective development results in a war zone. Its most extensive program since Vietnam, the effort has pushed the agency well beyond its traditional boundary of delivering development aid. This report—which is based on field experience in Afghanistan, interviews, and a review of retrospective analyses—examines the challenges of working amid conflict while, despite generous funding, subject to shifting political and security objectives and high expectations. Its recommendations are specific and targeted to future endeavors in similar environments around the world. 

**Summary**

- The demands on USAID in Afghanistan since 2002 have pushed it well outside its traditional boundaries.

- Expectations were high that USAID would provide development to match the major U.S. military effort: delivering enduring development results in a war zone and billions of dollars of assistance in the face of ever-changing priorities and urgency in a country torn apart by decades of civil war.
Running throughout have been trade-offs, and at times tension between short-term security and political objectives, using quick-response actions and longer-term development efforts needed to strengthen institutions, support economic growth, reconstruct destroyed infrastructure and build a state after decades of civil war.

- Short-term stabilization programs or long-term development programs in areas with active ongoing conflict have had limited enduring impact. Targeted humanitarian assistance has had more impact.
Clarity is essential for short-term, quick-impact, quick-response programs, especially in regard to related timelines, sustainability issues, risks, the impact of exogenous events on stability, governance and “hearts and minds” programs, and the broader strategic policy requirements to achieve stated U.S. political and security objectives. Keeping expectations reasonable, especially in complex environments, is imperative.

- As much as possible in a war zone situation, proven development principles—such as local systems, sustainability, evidence-based design and implementation, strong monitoring and evaluation, and country ownership—need to be maintained. Requisite analyses up front are essential, as is focus on institutions and local capacity.

**About the Report**

This Special Report examines the challenges the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) encountered while working in a war zone, despite generous funding, subject to high expectations for long-term institutional development results and constantly shifting U.S. short-term political and security objectives. Based on field experience in Afghanistan, interviews with key practitioners, and a review of retrospective analyses, the report was drafted while the author was an interagency professional in residence at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP). The report reflects the author’s viewpoints and opinions and not those of USAID or USIP.

2387879,"Details Announced on Expanded Approach to Sustainably Address Humanitarian Situation in
Yemen December 20, 2017: Today, the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen- represented by the Spokesperson, Col. Turki Al Maliki, along with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Yemen- Ambassador MonahmmedAl Jaber, spoke at a joint press conference in Riyadh to discuss details around a more comprehensive approach to relieve the suffering of the Yemeni people and address the humanitarian situation there with a long-term view. The full humanitarian response plan will be announced soon.  
Humanitarian Plan Overview by the Kingdom’s Ambassador to Yemen, Ambassador Mohammed Al Jaber

- The comprehensive humanitarian efforts aim to remedy the human condition in Yemen, through providing humanitarian aid and commercial shipments of foodstuffs, petroleum products, and other commercial goods delivered to the Yemeni people in all regions of Yemen. It aims at doing so in a way that addresses the needs of Yemen, providing a means for a dignified life for the Yemeni people, at a level much higher than it was at during the year 2017. The goal of the humanitarian operations is not to provide a temporary solution but to address and repair the humanitarian conditions in Yemen in a comprehensive and lasting manner.

- The Coalition today has declared that it will continue to keep Hodeidah Port open for humanitarian and aid provisions, allowing entry for commercial shipments, including petroleum byproducts, foodstuff, and other products, for thirty days, as a measure to support the effort of the UN envoy Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh and his recommendations regarding Hodeidah Port.

- The Coalition will permit the entry of the UN’s four cranes to Hodeidah Port.

- The humanitarian operations include increasing the capacity of the Yemeni ports, using the various land passes from the Kingdom, and using the Port of Jizan, if the need arises, to ensure that humanitarian aid and commercial shipments are delivered to all the regions in Yemen.

- The Coalition will provide safe passage corridors for the humanitarian aid and commercial shipments to reach their destinations in all the regions of Yemen. This step aims to ensure that the humanitarian aid operations are flexible. The goal of delivering comprehensive humanitarian aid and commercial shipments remains, despite the Iranian-backed Houthi militias continued impedance and rejection of all the global efforts and suggestions in this regard.

- We will coordinate with the legitimate government of Yemen, through convening urgently in the coming days with the UN and other humanitarian organizations, to discuss the various details of the humanitarian operations, and the means and mechanisms of implementation, as well as, the role of the UN and humanitarian aid agencies play, to complete the organizational discussion and begin implementation as soon as possible. We will also discuss with the UN the humanitarian contributions needed to ease the suffering of our neighbors in Yemen.

- We continue to work on implementing these steps at a time when our cities and our citizens face a continued assault by ballistic missiles at the hands of the Iranian-backed Houthi militia. In this comprehensive humanitarian operation; we seek to lift the injustice and oppression that these Iranian-supported militias are placing on the people of Yemen. We will not allow the Iranian-backed Houthi militia to continue to dominate and loot the humanitarian aid and commercial shipments and use them in their assault on the people of Yemen

**Operational Statement by the Spokesperson for the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen, Colonel Turki Al Maliki**

The Threat of Ballistic Missiles:

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels pose a direct threat to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The Iranianbacked Houthi militia threaten the Kingdom’s territory both through missile launches and through attempts by militants to penetrate the border on foot in mountainous areas. o He confirmed that the missiles fired at Riyadh were produced in Iran.  
These missiles were not previously present in Yemen. o He confirmed that at least ballistic 83 missiles have been fired into the Kingdom’s territory. o He reiterated that Iranian-supplied missiles are a security threat for the region, as well as, a growing number of countries, such as Lebanon and Europe.  
Humanitarian Aid Access:

- Col. Al Maliki reiterated that goods are continuing to enter Yemen even after the first missile launch into Riyadh:

o AIR ENTRY: Nov 13-Dec 20 -- 340 permits for aid delivery at 5 airports. 196 tons of cargo. o SEA ENTRY: Nov 13-Dec 20 – 259 permits issued, 435,051 tons of food and 296 tons of medical; including fuel supplies.

- He confirmed that the Coalition intends to keep Hodeidah Port open for 30 days as stated today. In addition to the previous aid, commercial food and fuel aid are also permitted to enter.

- As iterated by Ambassador Al Jaber, 4 cranes funded by USAID will be allowed into Hodeidah Port soon.

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that the Iranian-backed Houthi leadership continuously refuse to accept proposals from the UN Special Envoy for inspection protocols or independent administration of the Port of Hodeidah.  

Targeting Procedures and Military Operations:

- Col. Al Maliki also mentioned that Coalition airstrikes are based on intelligence and extensive monitoring and surveillance, to ensure all targets are military installations and to avoid civilian casualties.

- He reiterated that targeting is specific, clear, and legal. o Extensive precautions are taken to avoid civilian areas, especially where women and children are present.

- Col. Al Maliki highlighted that some strikes are made at the request of the Yemeni Armed Forces. o Examples of facilities targeted include weapons factories, storage facilities, training camps, air defense assets, and coastal radar threatening Red Sea ships.

- Forces of Yemen’s legitimate authorities control 85% of the territory.

- More than 11,000 Houthi fighters have been killed since the operation began.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

**Operational Update**

UNHCR is bracing for further displacement and a spike in humanitarian needs as hostilities intensify in frontline areas on Yemen’s west coast. This follows the recent fighting in the capital, Sana’a, and neighbouring northern governorates. Over the past number of days, UNHCR has received reports of new displacement from Hudaydah and Taizz Governorates. UNHCR and partners are still assessing the situation, but initial reports are that more than 1,400 people have fled from Taizz and Hudaydah to locations in Southern Taizz and Lahj. With numbers expected to rise further, UNHCR is working with partners to support and help those fleeing, with emergency relief items for 2,000 families in Hudaydah, and a further 2,000 aid kits are on their way along with 2,000 emergency shelter kits.  

Meanwhile, following recent clashes, the situation in Sana’a has returned to relative calm, with UN humanitarian flights resuming a reduced service. UNHCR offices in Sana'a reopened as of this week with a core team of international staff, and is working with partners to resume humanitarian operations that were put on hold due to insecurity in early December. As a matter of urgency, UNHCR is restoring services where possible and resuming assistance for the most vulnerable IDP and refugee families, particularly a winter cash assistance programme aimed at 17,000 families.  

On 17 December, humanitarian organizations in Yemen issued a statement emphasizing neutrality and condemning any allegations of corruption and bias in the provision of relief assistance by parties to the conflict. UNHCR continues to work to serve the growing needs of those in Yemen and advocates for a political solution to put an end to the suffering.  

In Aden on 10 December, following repeated delays caused by difficulties in receiving clearance, the fourth Assisted Spontaneous Return (ASR) departure took place. A total of 108 returnees arrived safely in Berbera port in Somalia on 11 December, supported with return cash grants to assist their reintegration. On 18 December, a fifth movement took place. So far, a total of 676 individuals have returned to Somalia through the UNHCR-led programme in coordination with IOM.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2387429,"Evaluation of 3rd Call off of civil society support through umbrella organisations 2013–2017 **Executive Summary**

This report presents the findings, conclusions and recommendations from the evaluation of the third call of civil society support in Ethiopia through umbrella organisations. The evaluation was commissioned by Sida.

The Ethiopian context is challenging. The 2009 Charities and Societies Proclamation severely restricted the space for civil society organisations to work on rights-based issues and for donors to provide funding for human rights and democracy promotion.  
In the third call, five umbrella organisations were funded with a total of MSEK 61 for three years. They in turn selected some hundred sub-grantees/implementing partners.  
The projects were supposed to contribute to strengthening the role and capacity of civil society, address marginalised areas and groups, gender equality, women’s and youth’s economic empowerment and harmful traditional practices (HTPs) and gender based violence (GBV).

The main objectives of this evaluation were to document and analyse results – effectiveness, impact and relevance – and their sustainability and to analyse the relevance and effectiveness of these results and modes of working in relation to the new Swedish strategy for development cooperation in Ethiopia.  
Findings

**Effectiveness**

There are many similarities with respect to project design, thematic areas and partners between the five umbrella organisations, but also some differences. Jerusalem Children and Community development Organisation (JeCCDO) exclusively works with community-based organisations (CBOs) that support OVCs, their caregivers/guardians and other vulnerable groups in their communities. Initiative Africa (IA) and its NGO partners promote female students’ access to education through a number of measures. Union of Ethiopian Women Charitable Associations (UEWCA) and Mothers and Children Multi-sectoral Development Organisation (MCMDO) support interventions against FGM and HTPs. UEWCA also engages in, among others, improving the economic capacity of women and in supporting OVC students and their guardians. The Center for Development Initiatives (CDI) attempts to curtail trafficking and GBV. 

The evaluation team’s document review, interviews with management representatives of the umbrella organisations and field trips to four regions, Amhara, Tigray, Oromia and SNNPR, where sub-grantees, beneficiaries and local government representatives were interviewed, clearly show that there are results. Women have been assisted with business training and credits to start income-generating activities, OVCs were supported with school materials and girls from low-income families were enabled to aim for higher education. Awareness-raising and other activities addressed genderbased violence, harmful traditional practices and trafficking. The subgrantees/partners have acquired new skills, primarily relating to organisational capacity, in trainings and experience sharing exchanges. 

The evaluation aimed to assess the effectiveness of the interventions, but magnitude and quality of the achievements were often difficult to assess. There were several reasons for this, mainly related to incoherent reporting, lack of systematic monitoring and limited analysis.  
Some of the umbrellas claim to have achieved amazing reductions of HTPs.  
Comprehensive evidence to back these claims is, however, lacking. 

IA and its partners had developed a results matrix with objectives and indicators that were used to monitor achievements. However, as the results were at output level, more long-term effects were not captured. Due to the short programme period this would probably have been difficult anyhow.  
An observation that seems to be relevant for all the five umbrellas and their subgrantees/partners is that the results have been achieved for the immediate target groups while there are few effects at overall societal level, benefiting more destitute women, OVCs that have dropped out of school and victims of HTPs than those who participate in the project activities. One example of such effects at system level is, however, IA and ETA’s work with a school violence index, which the Ministry of Education has agreed to use in all schools in the country.

**Impact**

Despite restrictive legislation, sub-grantees at local level have managed to establish relationships of trust and confidence with relevant government offices in woredas and kebeles. There are examples of this interaction having led to increased accountability of government officials at local level. Sub-grantees were also able to exploit grey zones of the legislation, for example through cooperating with local government bureaus on rights-related trainings. At the same time, however, some CSOs struggled to maintain their independence and avoid co-optation. 

**Relevance**

In relation to the topics mentioned in the call for proposals, the support has been relevant. Almost 9,000 women have been economically empowered, about 28,000 girls have studied instead of being married off, 5,500 OVCs have been supported, and street children have returned to school. CSOs have been strengthened and especially the CBOs have developed, from funeral societies to development actors. Some organisations – and their beneficiaries - have been empowered to take on a more active role in their communities. Thereby they have contributed to voices of marginalised groups being heard and a more pluralistic society.

What a human rights-based approach (HRBA) entails is unclear, both due to the Ethiopian context and the confusion of human rights as an objective and the rights perspective as an approach. Many CSOs claim that they are applying a rights-based approach, but this mostly means that they work on some rights, framing the issue in a neutral language, or vaguely refer to equality, dialogue and related issues.

**Relevance and Effectiveness for the New Swedish Strategy**

The objectives of the organisations and the results they have achieved are relevant for the new Swedish strategy for development cooperation with Ethiopia 2016-2020, primarily for expected contributions under the area “Strengthened democracy and gender equality and greater respect for human rights”. Their modes of work are also relevant for the strategy areas “opportunities and tools to enable poor people to improve their living conditions” and “better environment”. The latter area has the advantage of being less sensitive in the restrictive legal environment in Ethiopia.  
However, limited space for civil society is not the only obstacle to work for strategic results and policy change. Increased civil society interventions for such transformations would also require analysis and strategic thinking as well as a longterm perspective.

**Recommendations**

Among the recommendations to the umbrella organisations are that they should initiate a process where plans and strategies for influencing policy making are elaborated. Umbrellas and sub-grantees would benefit from more clearly trying to delineate their agenda from the government’s agenda. To better account for their resource use, as well as for learning purposes, the organisations should develop and implement monitoring and evaluation systems that are useful for all stakeholders, simple and easy to use. Efforts should also be made to operationalise the concept of HRBA.

The recommendations to the Embassy/Sida include considering the advantages and disadvantages with different types of partners - CBOs, mass-based and developmental and NGOs. Capacity development should be provided to the umbrellas and the programme period should be extended. Furthermore, efforts should be made to promote exchange with similar support programmes, such as the CSSP. The Embassy/Sida should also, together with the umbrella organisations, explore the possibilities of conducting a study on the long term effects of the support on different categories of beneficiaries.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

2386119,"Mali: Food Assistance Fact Sheet -  December 19, 2017 **Situation**

- Recurrent natural disasters, limited job opportunities and severe poverty contribute to chronic malnutrition and hunger in Mali, with civil conflict since 2012 exacerbating food insecurity and spurring population displacement in the north. As of late 2017, the Government of Mali (GoM) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that there were approximately 40,700 internally displaced persons within Mali and 134,100 Malian refugees residing in neighboring countries. Overall, nearly 44 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line, according to the World Bank. Preliminary results from a national nutrition survey, conducted by the GoM and UN agencies in mid-2017, found that almost 11 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition. In Timbuktu and Gao regions, the malnutrition level exceeded 15 percent, the UN World Health Organization’s emergency threshold.

- The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report that farmers are currently harvesting their crops across the country, with yields projected to be significantly higher than the five-year average. FEWS NET anticipates that most households in Mali will face Minimal (IPC 1) food insecurity through May 2018. However, food security conditions in some regions, including the Western Sahel, the Inner Niger Delta and pastoral areas of Timbuktu and Gao regions, will likely decline to Stressed (IPC 2) levels of food insecurity between March and May as cereal prices increase and households deplete their food stocks. A recent Cadre Harmonisé (CH) report—a tool used in West Africa for the classification and quantification of food insecurity—also projected that 795,000 Malians will likely face Crisis (Phase 3) or worse levels of food insecurity between June and August 2018, a period which includes pastoral and agricultural lean seasons.*

\* The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a standardized tool that aims to classify the severity and magnitude of food insecurity. The IPC scale, comparable across countries, ranges from Minimal (IPC 1) to Famine (IPC 5). The CH, a similar tool used only in West Africa, has a separate scale ranging from Minimal (Phase 1) to Famine (Phase 5).

**Response**

- In Mali, USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) works with the UN World Food Program (WFP) to respond to urgent food needs though general food distributions, blanket and targeted supplementary feeding programs and food-for-assets activities. FFP also facilitates WFP’s local and regional purchase of food and delivery of food vouchers to stimulate local production and markets. Through the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), FFP provides ready-to-use therapeutic food to treat severely malnourished children.

- With support from FFP, non-governmental organization (NGO) partners provide cash transfers and food vouchers to vulnerable Malians to both improve household access to food and spur market recovery. These partners are also helping to restore community infrastructure and diversify livelihoods. 

- FFP partners with NGO CARE to implement a five-year, $45 million development program to benefit more than 300,000 individuals in the Mopti region. The project aims to strengthen food, nutrition and income security among poor households and improve their resilience to future shocks.

However, while in Dominica 94 per cent of publicowned or funded schools have reopened, attendance is only at 68 per cent, possibly highlighting the impact of outward migration in the aftermath of the hurricane.

- The resettlement of Barbuda residents has not gone according to plan with only 34 per cent of the population signaling an intent to return from Antigua in the short-term; the main ferry service being out of operation and a decision that the previously state-funded passage (US$ 72 round trip) will now be borne directly by passengers.

- In Dominica, only eight per cent of people, mainly those living in the cities of Roseau and Portsmouth, have access to electricity. In the British Virgin Islands (BVI) only one-fifth of the population has restored power.

- Since the launch of the programme on 4 December, approximately 1,120 children from a target population of 6,000 vulnerable children and their families have been reached with the UNICEF-supported Emergency Cash Transfer Programme in Dominica.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

With the holiday season approaching, increasing pockets of population in hurricane-ravaged countries continue to see a gradual return to normalcy; but a large segment of the population is still struggling. While critical services, such as water, were restored to between 70 and 90 per cent of people (British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands, respectively), the return of electricity has been at a much slower rate. As of 13 December 2017, over 90 per cent of the population in Dominica was without electricity, while 80 per cent of the residents in British Virgin Islands and 40 per cent in Anguilla remain without power.  

The education sector continues to make strides to return to normal, even as a shift system and temporary learning spaces - such as UNICEF-provided tents - continue to be utilised. School enrolment figures in Antigua (Barbuda), Anguilla and Turks and Caicos Islands have reached or surpassed pre-hurricane levels, reflecting some movement between the islands, especially from Dominica. In Dominica, 94 per cent of all public-owned or funded pre-schools, primary and secondary schools have reopened, with an attendance rate of 68 per cent, according to pre-hurricane enrolment figures. However, considering migration trends since the hurricane,it is expected that the school-age population currently residing on the island is below the 18 September 2017 figure.  

The expected resettlement of Barbuda residents currently in Antigua, remains a critical concern. According to the *Intent to Return* survey conducted by IOM, only 34 per cent of approximately 1,600 people, want to return in the short term. The means of transportation from Antigua to the smaller sister island is also doubtful, with the main ferry being out of service, and a decision that Government will no longer bear the cost of the passage.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

2385694,"Yemen - Inter-Agency Joint Cash Study: Market Functionality And Community Perception of Cash Based Assistance - December 2017 **SUMMARY**

Since 2015, conflict in Yemen has left 3 million people displaced and over half of the population food insecure, and has destroyed much of the country’s infrastructure1. As of July 2017, much of the population had lost their primary source of income, 46% lacked access to a free improved water source, and an outbreak of cholera had become the largest in modern history.

The Cash and Market Working Group (CMWG) estimated that in 2016, cash transfer programmes were conducted in 22 governorates across Yemen; however, it found little evidence to determine which method of financial assistance is the most suitable in the context of Yemen. In order to build an understanding of the current market systems and the perceptions of the Yemeni population towards cash transfer programmes, the CMWG initiated this study with the objective of identifying the most appropriate method of cash based interventions to be used by humanitarian actors. A Technical Assessment Working Group (TAWG) was established to coordinate the design, implementation and analysis phases, and was chaired by REACH and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The members of TAWG contributed resources and actively participated in data collection for the study, while REACH provided remote support and technical expertise, primarily by: providing advice for the development of tools and methodology of the study; providing technical and coordination support for data collection; leading technical data management and data cleaning; developing data analysis framework and leading data analysis process; designing, drafting and disseminating the final output; and producing maps and other data visualisation products.

This study consisted of two components, the first of which aimed to build an understanding of market functionality across 13 governorates of Yemen to which partner organisations were able to gain access, through Key Informant interviews conducted with 1399 vendors of selected essential commodities. The second component of the study was based on 114 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with different population groups (internally displaced persons, returnees, host community members and members of the historically marginalised Muhamasheen community) across 11 governorates, and aimed to explore the perceptions of communities towards cash based assistance mechanisms and address how household access to markets and financial services has changed since the onset of the conflict in 2015. The primary data for this study was collected between August and September 2017, and so is representative of the market at that point in time.

**Key Findings.**
**Market Functionality**

- The study found that in the west of Yemen, two market systems are operating semi-independently of one another. Divided by the line of conflict, the north-west and central west of the country is supplied primarily by the port Al Hudaydah, while the south west of the country is supplied by the port of Aden. The two supply networks have varying availability of goods, and different distribution mechanisms, with Al Hudaydah supplying vendors through a wholesale distribution network for most products, whereas distributors in Aden tend to directly supply vendors in neighbouring governorates. The port of Al Mukalla and the cooking gas producers of Marib are the exceptions to this trend, supplying vendors across the west of Yemen.

- At the time of data collection, a shortage of fuel was reported across Aden and the south west of the country, which subsequently resulted in transportation issues, longer restocking times and dysfunctional market price mechanisms between vendors in neighbouring governorates for essential products. Diesel supplies appeared to be a particular issue, with many diesel vendors in the south west of the country having to source their products from Al Mukalla. The findings of this study indicate that Al Hudaydah is the primary supplier of fuel and essential resources for the majority of western Yemen, and that if a situation arose whereby only the port of Aden was available for food and fuel imports, then this would have severe repercussions across the centre west and north west of the country.

- In order to evaluate the suitability of a cash transfer programme for different product types, each commodity group was assessed against a set of criteria including availability, consistency of pricing at a governorate level, and consistency of restocking times between governorates. Based on these criteria, and the data collected through the community FGDs, this study found that multi-purpose cash grants targeting food, cooking gas, hygiene items and water trucking would be the most suitable mechanism of cash based assistance.

2. Community Access to Market, Acceptance, Safety and Risk

- Price inflation, liquidity issues and falling purchasing power have presented major constraints to vendors and consumers across the country, while rapidly increasing fuel costs have impacted upon all sectors of the market, with many communities now financially and physically unable to access their local markets.

- FGD participants highlighted the scarcity of banks as the main barrier to accessing assistance through financial services providers. With the cost of transportation to their nearest bank reaching prohibitively high levels, many FGD participants reported that they were unable to travel on a regular basis. Furthermore, FGD participants indicated that banks were known to be struggling with liquidity shortages in many areas, and that the level of overcrowding meant that banks were no longer easily accessible to women and the elderly. It was also reported that the risk of theft was higher in proximity to banks.

- The major finding of the community component of this study was that any cash based intervention must prioritise flexibility and convenience to recipients. FGD participants emphasized the importance of a mechanism which allowed flexibility for them to meet their specific needs, and which could be distributed and utilised without incurring transportation costs. They also indicated that exchange offices, which have traditionally been used to transfer funds through the Hawala system, were the financial service provider to which communities had the greatest access, and which they felt most familiar with.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2385584,"UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, November 2017 **Highlights**

- An earthquake in north-eastern Iraq on 12 November reached 7.3 on the Richter scale. UNICEF provided technical support to needs assessments in affected areas with specific focus on education and WASH.

- A total of 108 school buildings were damaged, six of them badly. UNICEF will deliver 52 temporary learning spaces to affected communities to support continuation of education for over 3,800 students while more comprehensive repairs commence. Immediate WASH needs in affected areas are being met by the government, with UNICEF and WASH partners on standby.

- Water trucking continued in 16 neighbourhoods of West Mosul, filling a water supply gap while repair of the municipal network continues. In November, 109,800 people (half of them children) had continued access to safe water through this intervention.

- In November, there was a decrease in Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) deliveries distributions compared to October, due to the end of military operations in western Anbar, and a decrease in new internal displacements. In total 70,255 individuals received RRM distributions in November.

- Winter response began, and reached 5, 367 children with warm winter clothing, including 787 earthquake-affected children.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

Military operations to retake the remaining western Anbar districts under the control of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) ended in mid-November. Around 22,000 people have been reported as newly-displaced since the Anbar campaign began in September 20171 .An interagency assessment mission indicated shortage of basic services with drinking water, health care, household items and winter clothing reported as the most pressing humanitarian needs. The total number of displaced has dropped below 3 million people for the first time since 2014. Although over 2.6 million people have returned home, many locations have suffered significant conflict damage, and local authorities may not offer basic services, including water and sanitation, primary healthcare, or education.  

Protection concerns remain for people returning to areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance, and on the voluntary nature of returns. On 12 November, northeast Iraq experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 on the Richter scale, per the United States Geological Survey (USGS), with the epicentre on the Iranian side of the Iran-Iraq border. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) reported nine fatalities and over 550 people injured, with most affected districts being Darbandikhan, Halabja, and Garmiyan. The Darbandikhan Dam on the Diyala River was impacted by landslides that partially blocked the spillway and caused structural damage. Immediate need for shelter and warm clothes were reported, and 108 schools were damaged, at least 16 of them badly.UNICEF participated in joint OCHA-led assessments, and a UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team specialized in natural disasters arrived within four days at the request of the Government of Iraq (GoI). Smaller-scale aftershocks of 4 to 4.5 on the Richter scale continued throughout the month.  
Despite growing international pressure and some concessions offered by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), tensions between the federal Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government have not yet been resolved. Although humanitarian access across KRG and federal internal borders has improved since October, in some areas alternative routes are needed to avoid high-risk areas. Concerns about waterborne disease outbreaks remain high. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF are monitoring and responding with Ministry of Health (MoH),  
Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and relevant ministries.  

**Humanitarian leadership and coordination** 

UNICEF leads the WASH Cluster, co-leads the Education cluster with Save the Children International, leads the Child Protection sub-cluster and Nutrition working group, and is an active member of the Health cluster. UNICEF, UNFPA, and WFP coordinate the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) Consortium serving IDPs, and the Multi-Sector Emergency Package (MSEP), delivering aid in retaken areas. In November, the child protection sub-cluster finalised a ‘Minimum Package for Child Protection in urban newly-retaken locations’. This guidance focuses on a community-based approach, including integration between CP and education. UNICEF, UNHCR, and WHO coordinate with relevant line Ministries through the Cholera Taskforce, led by the MoH.  

**Humanitarian Strategy** 

Humanitarian action complements recovery and stabilization activities by enhancing preparedness and response capacity of State institutions and local actors. Under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), strategic priorities are to: reach as many people in need as possible across Iraq by securing safe access to front-line and newly retaken areas; facilitate and advocate for voluntary, safe, and dignified returns; give options to families to live in Iraq in dignity by expanding resilience and social cohesion programmes; and help people affected by violence recover by providing specialized protection assistance. In support of the national response, humanitarian partners are expected to simultaneously respond to both mass displacement and mass returns. The development of the Iraq 2018 HRP is ongoing. With the 2018 Cluster strategies finalised, partners’ projects are submitted to Clusters, and will be reviewed in early December, after which cluster portfolios will be presented to the HRP Advisory Board.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"

Ambassador Daniel V. Speckhard, LWR president & CEO, noted that armed conflict is a thread running through the world's current crises.

""From Syria to Yemen to South Sudan to the Philippines and Myanmar, we are witnessing spiraling violence and repeated violations of humanitarian law, including targeting of hospitals, schools and civilian residential areas, as well as blockades of relief aid,"" he said. ""These large, simultaneous emergencies have taxed the international community's ability to respond.""

Recent political developments, including the global embrace of nationalist populism and a lack of cohesive leadership in the international community, have only increased tensions.

""The international political and security situation is at one of its most dangerous points since the end of the Cold War, and in such an insecure and deeply hostile world, the world's poorest and most vulnerable people will suffer the most."" Speckhard said. ""As more and more Western governments close their borders to refugees fleeing war, the world's capacity for compassion seems to be shrinking.""

The countries and regions on the 2018 Watch List include:

* The Rohingya, facing ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, flee to Bangladesh

* In Yemen, using food as a weapon

* Ending protected status for Central American and Haitian refugees threaten local economies

* Uganda struggles with a refugee spike

* Diseases and pests are devastating crops in the developing world

* As ISIS leaves Iraq, Kurdish tensions escalate

* West Africa's Sahel: A crossroads for extremists and human trafficking

* ISIS gains a foothold in the Philippines

* Lebanon: An arena for Saudi vs. Iran tug of war

* Zimbabwe post-Mugabe: What may be next

* Venezuela on the brink

2385349,"DR Congo: The case for taking the administration seriously *Stylianos Moshonas, Tom De Herdt and Kristof Titeca explore the challenges facing the DR Congo civil service.*

The Congolese administration in its current state has long been pointed to as a major impediment to Congo’s ambition to achieve developmental outcomes: threadbare on the service delivery front, inefficient, excessive in urban settings, and corrupt – indeed indicative of the state’s predatory nature. In a sense, the civil service has come a long way: the outbreak of war in the 1990s came atop decades of economic crisis, structural adjustment, and state decline, and meant that in 2001 – when donors re-engaged with the country after ten years of absence – administrative capacity was very emaciated. Since then, though, a wide array of (mostly donor-promoted) structural reforms have  been unrolled in the DRC.

2385194,"Occupied Palestinian Territory: Humanitarian Needs Overview 2018, November 2017 OVERVIEW 

The humanitarian context of the oPt is unique amongst today’s crises and remains directly tied to the impact of the occupation, which marked its 50th year in June 2017. A protracted protection crisis continues. At least 1.9 million Palestinians experience, or are at risk of, conflict and violence, displacement and denial of access to livelihoods, among other threats. The most vulnerable Palestinians are currently denied or restricted in their access to essential services such as water and health care. A recurrent cycle of shocks, natural and manmade, has eroded the resilience of vulnerable households to cope with the prolonged nature of the humanitarian crisis. 

These dynamics are significantly magnified in the Gaza context by the protracted blockade, imposed by Israel citing security concerns after the takeover of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, three major escalations of hostilities in less than ten years and the intensification of the internal divide between the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) and the de facto Hamas authorities during the course of 2017. Combined, these factors have devastated public infrastructure, disrupted the delivery of basic services and undermined already vulnerable living conditions. Across the oPt, one in two Palestinians, or roughly two and a half million people, will need some form of humanitarian assistance in 2018.

GAZA STRIP 

The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip deteriorated markedly in 2017 due to an escalation in the internal Palestinian political divide, following the decision in March by the de facto Hamas leadership to establish a parallel structure to run local ministries in Gaza.In response, the PA reduced payments for electricity, the allowances of public employees, and payments for the referral of patients for treatment outside Gaza. Longer power outages have negatively impacted basic health and water and sanitation services and limited the ability of farmers to irrigate their lands, further undermining food security and livelihoods. Following Egyptian mediation, the two sides reached an agreement in October 2017, which envisages the PA resuming control of the Gaza crossings, as a necessary first step towards alleviating the humanitarian situation and achieving the goal of Palestinian unity under a single, democratic and legitimate national authority. The measures put in place in Gaza in 2017 by the PA had yet to be reversed at the time of preparation of the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO).

The magnitude of the challenges facing Gaza is underlined in a recent United Nations report projecting the situation of Gaza in the year 2020. The study revisited key indicators first published in 2012, and found “that most of the projections for 2020 have in fact deteriorated even further and faster than anticipated” with the population increasing and the economy and basic infrastructure and services deteriorating, and “simply unable to keep up with demand.” Real GDP growth in Gaza has slowed to only 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, while the unemployment rate for the second quarter rose to 44 per cent. Unemployment among those aged between 15 and 29 has reached a “staggering” 62 per cent. According to The Economist, “In real terms, Gazans are about 25 per cent poorer today than they were at the time of the Oslo Accords.” The standard of living in Gaza, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person of $1,700 a year in 2015, is comparable to Congo-Brazzaville; the West Bank figure, $3,700 a year, is similar to Egypt; while Israel, $35,000 a year, is “much the same as France”.

The August 2014 ceasefire continues to hold, with a relatively low number of Palestinian fatalities (17) and injuries (221) by Israeli forces as of November 2017, and no further conflict-related displacement recorded.  Approximately 23,500 people still remain displaced from the 2014 conflict, as of November 2017. The Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has played a key role in facilitating increased imports of construction materials; however, it has been less successful in facilitating the import of dual use materials beyond cement and re-bar, also critical for public works projects.  
As of November 2017, 5,755 out of the 11,000 totally destroyed housing units have been reconstructed and work on an additional 818 is underway. Insufficient funding is the primary obstacle to completing the remaining residential reconstruction projects.

Most of the two million Palestinians in Gaza remain unable to access the remainder of the oPt and the outside world, with only a minority eligible for exit permits via Israel, primarily patients, business people and the staff of international organizations. Although the number of Palestinian exits increased after the 2014 hostilities, figures have declined significantly again since the second half of 2016, with the figure for November 2017 some 47 per cent below the 2016 average. While there has been a gradual increase in the absolute number of medical patients allowed through the Israeli-controlled Erez crossing, the approval rate has also been declining, at 55 per cent in October compared to 93 per cent in 2012. While the number of approved permit applications for United Nations national staff to leave Gaza increased by 19.7 per cent from the second half of 2016 to the first half of 2017, the Israeli authorities have significantly increased the time necessary for processing permits, from 26 to 55 working days, impeding humanitarian operations.  
Movement constraints have been compounded by the protracted closure of the Rafah terminal, which has only partially opened for 29 days in 2017, allowing 1,222 patients to exit for medical treatment.

**Protection** 

Although the 2014 ceasefire has held, the ongoing restrictions on the movement of people and goods and the threat of a new round of hostilities are major protection concerns for Palestinians in Gaza. These concerns are exacerbated by the rising hopelessness and deterioration in the humanitarian situation, as well as by the shooting of rockets at Israel and the digging of attack tunnels, among other factors. The risk of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) remains and high levels of psychosocial distress are reported across the population, particularly among children, leaving them with a deep sense of insecurity, fear and hopelessness. The protracted humanitarian crisis has also exacerbated genderbased-violence (GBV) in all its forms, including sexual violence, domestic violence and child marriage. The Protection Cluster continues to identify accountability for violations during the Gaza hostilities in 2014, by all sides, and for violations during the daily enforcement of restrictions in the Access Restricted Areas (ARAs) as an urgent priority. 

**Displacement**

No new displacement was recorded in Gaza in 2017. The GRM has provided access to vital construction materials, but as of November 2017 funding is lacking for the reconstruction of about 3,800 destroyed and over 56,500 damaged housing units from the 2014 round of hostilities. Displacement continues for 23,500 people who are primarily reliant on temporary shelter cash assistance (TSCA) to rent accommodation until their homes are reconstructed or rehabilitated. TSCA been disrupted due to significant funding shortages with anecdotal evidence suggesting that this has resulted in debt accumulation and the adoption of negative coping mechanisms such as withdrawing children from school or engaging children in income generation.10 Some 4,500 families who have not yet received assistance to repair conflict-related damages are in urgent need of support due to continued exposure to the elements, high vulnerability and lack of resources. In addition, 8,100 families are at risk of exposure due to inadequate protection against the natural elements.  

**Access to essential services** 

The provision of basic services in Gaza remains a key humanitarian concern. Increasing electricity cuts are undermining basic services already depleted by the blockade, recurrent hostilities and restrictions on the import of goods considered “dual use”. Surgeries are being delayed, some diagnostic services are being put on hold, and there has been a disruption in the delivery of primary healthcare (PHC) and secondary healthcare (SHC) services by the Ministry of Health (MoH). Health provision is also impeded by delays in the shipment of essential drugs and disposables from the PA Ministry of Health, which has also recently been delaying or suspending payment for the referral of patients for medical treatment outside Gaza. The number of permit applications denied or delayed by Israel to access health care outside Gaza has also been on the increase, reaching 45 per cent of applications in October 2017.  

The blockade and escalations in hostilities have also resulted in repeated damage and the destruction of infrastructure, the deaths of students and teachers and psychosocial stress among children and teachers. Increasing electricity shortages are affecting children’s right and ability to access education at school and at home, restricting study time and their ability to concentrate.  
Some 70 per cent of UNRWA schools and over 63 per cent of Ministry of Education schools operate on a double or triple shift system which has reduced instruction time to about four hours a day, and limited the time available to reinforce learning, support slow learners, and offer remedial education and extracurricular activities. Psychosocial services are also struggling to cope with the nearly 300,000 children who require some form of mental health support or psychosocial intervention. 
 
Water and sanitation (WASH) infrastructure and delivery has also been impacted by recurrent conflict, the over exploitation of resources and restrictions on the import of “dual use” WASH items. Over 95 per cent of the water extracted from the aquifer is unfit for human consumption, with the result that 90 per cent of people in Gaza rely on purchasing desalinated water from private trucking, posing a heavy financial burden on already impoverished families and health risks due to widespread contamination of that source. Increased electricity cuts have further reduced the drinkable/ piped water supply and the operation of approximately 130 critical water and sanitation facilities. This has resulted in the discharge of untreated sewage into the sea, contaminating the majority of Gaza beaches, and heightening the risk of the overflow of raw sewage onto the streets.  

**Erosion of resilience** 

Recurrent hostilities, the blockade, degraded infrastructure and cuts in the allowances of public employees have impaired economic growth and perpetuated high levels of poverty, unemployment, (particularly among youth), and food insecurity. About 80 per cent of people in Gaza receive food assistance and other forms of social transfers which enable scarce cash resources to be spent on other essentials, preventing a further deterioration of food security and livelihood status, and reducing the impact of negative coping mechanisms. Increased power shortages have further undermined economic activity, particularly in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, with some 30,000 out of 80,000 dunums planted with seasonal vegetable crops at risk due to irregular irrigation, and dairy cattle farmers and poultry breeders also facing significant losses. The condition of the aquifer, Gaza’s sole source of natural water, is of particular concern as it will be “unusable” by end-2017, with damage “irreversible” by 2020, “unless immediate remedial action is taken.”",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2385164,"Somali asylum seeker volunteers in local German fire brigade *Yusuf puts experience gained from two conflicts to good use as a volunteer firefighter in Fürstenwalde.*

FURSTENWALDE, Germany – In the vehicle bay of Fürstenwalde-Mitte fire station, a young volunteer checks the gears of a large fire engine. Yusuf Abdirahim, a 37-year-old asylum-seeker, knows what he is doing. He has been a member of this brigade for almost as long as he has been in Germany.

Volunteer firefighters like him come to the station in Fürstenwalde, a small town an hour’s drive from Berlin, for training once a week. An instructor named Sebastian is asking each of them to explain how the equipment functions.

Yusuf has already completed a basic training course called ‘Truppmann 1’, but before he can go on his first real rescue or firefighting mission, he must pass more exams and improve his German. In emergency situations, knowing how to communicate effectively can mean the difference between life and death.

However, Yusuf is no stranger to danger, or to working in the service of others.

Born in Somalia, he and his family fled the conflict to Yemen when he was only 11. There, he attended school and started a family before joining the Yemen Red Crescent Society in 2011, for which he distributed medical aid.

“When people are in need of help at a certain time and I am in the right place to provide it, this makes me happy,” he said.

Then, in 2014, Yusuf was forced to flee again, this time to escape being forcibly recruited into Yemen’s own conflict. After a long journey, he arrived in Germany in July 2015 – but his wife and two children are still trapped in Yemen.

With his experience as a volunteer, it seemed natural for Yusuf to put himself forward for service in Germany. When his German teacher suggested the idea of the volunteer fire brigade, he jumped at the chance. It has also helped Yusuf. Not a man who likes to sit still, the voluntary work challenges him and helps to ease his worries about his family for a few hours. Today, his German is better than his English and he can talk with his colleagues freely.

And he has already played a key role. Last year, the local fire brigade was repeatedly called to accommodation centres for asylum-seekers in Stahnsdorf and Oranienburg because residents were accidentally setting off the fire alarms. Yusuf was able to explain to them in Arabic and Somali how the alarm system worked, as well as where the assembly points and escape routes were in case of fire. In fact, he has made such a difference that the ‘Ohne Blaulicht’ (Without the Blue Light) project, organized by the Brandenburg Fire Brigade Association with government funding, will now be extended to other accommodation centres.

Jörn Müller, fire chief in Fürstenwalde, has been happy to welcome Yusuf and other newcomers into his brigade. “We are grateful for their support,” added Hans-Ulrich Hengst, Mayor of Fürstenwalde.

Hartmut Ziebs, President of the German Fire Brigade Association, is also a strong supporter of Germany’s 3,000 refugee firefighters and the positive impact they have had, calling such integration efforts “important and meaningful”.

The country’s voluntary fire brigades, with their 1.1 million members, are deeply rooted in German society, especially in the countryside. They have the ability to form bonds between newcomers and locals unlike any other organization and are a place to learn German and establish contacts that can help new arrivals find work and become financially independent.

Yusuf will receive his new firefighter’s uniform, a sturdy, sand-coloured protective suit with red reflective strips that is tailored to his measurements. The firefighter in charge of allocating uniforms adds a helmet and safety boots to Yusuf’s equipment – an investment in those members of the brigade “who have proven themselves”, he said and smiled.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2384609,"Devolution moves ahead in Somalia’s south west state with formation of district councils in Baidoa and Barawe The devolution of authority in Somalia’s federal system took another step forward in the city of Baidoa this week as senior officials of the country’s South West State launched the formation of local councils in the districts of Barawe and Baidoa.

At the launch, the Speaker of the South West State regional assembly, Abdikadir Sharif Maye, welcomed the support of the federal Ministry of Interior, Federal Affairs and Reconciliation, United Nations agencies and other partners in promoting the strengthening of federalism in Somalia.

The South West State Minister of Interior, Mohamednor Madoobe Nuunow, vowed to ensure the participation of women in the district councils that will be established in the coming weeks.

“I will assure you that the forthcoming district governing bodies of Baidoa and Barawe districts will be formed soon, and women will not be left behind,” he said at the event.

The establishment of district councils in the state kicked off with the formation of a council in Hudur district earlier this year and the inauguration of a mayor last October. The district of Bardale is currently in the process of establishing a council.

A local representative of the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) also addressed the launch, stressing the importance of reserving seats in the district councils for women and representatives of minority communities in the state.

“In the voting for parliamentary seats in the 2016 electoral process, South West State met the gender quota for women participation. As we are moving to the next phase, I strongly encourage similar consideration for women and minority clans,” UNSOM’s Deputy Head of Office in South West State, Usman Dogar, said.

According to the South West State constitution, the district councils of Baidoa and Barawe will consist of 27 seats each, and two of the seats will be set aside for women.  Members of each council will be chosen by 150 designated voters, and the newly-elected members will then choose a mayor from among their ranks.

This week’s district council launching event was attended by representatives of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).

The formation of district councils in South West state is taking place under the terms of a local government law that was approved by the state’s regional assembly and formally adopted last July.

2383704,"On first visit to Somalia, UN Envoy on Youth hails role played by young people in country's future Mogadishu – What’s a 27-year-old Sri Lankan woman doing in the middle of Somalia’s capital of Mogadishu, a city rebuilding after many years of chaos and civil war?  
In the case of Jayathma Wickramanayake, she’s doing her job.

Ms. Wickramanayake is the United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, charged with addressing the needs and rights of young people, and bringing the work of the world body closer to them – especially relevant tasks for Somalia, where young people under the age of 30 make up over two-thirds of the estimated population of over 12 million people.

“Youth are not just the leaders of tomorrow, they are the champions of today. It’s important that I get out of UN Headquarters to hear first-hand their concerns – including in a place like Somalia, where youth have gone through so much and are still facing structural and institutional barriers to greater participation due to their age -- and bring those concerns to the attention of the government, policy-makers and our UN teams on the ground,” she said about her visit, her first trip to an African country since she was appointed earlier this year.

Ms. Wickramanayake spent three days in the Somali capital engaged in a wide range of activities, including her participation in the second Somali National Youth Conference, a gathering of hundreds of youth representatives from all over the country that witnessed the launch of the Federal Government’s National Youth Policy on the opening day of the forum on 17 December.

“I’m here in Somalia to reassure the support of the United Nations to the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports, state ministries and the young people of Somalia,” the UN envoy said in her remarks to the conference. “The United Nations will always be with them in this journey of implementing their youth policy.”

Her visit to the Horn of Africa country is focusing renewed attention on issues of concern to young Somalis, including unemployment, illegal migration, insecurity and violent extremism.

The recently adopted National Youth Policy is aiming to address these challenges by removing institutional barriers to youth development. Ms. Wickramanayake urged young Somalis to pursue their goals and overcome the obstacles facing them.

“Time and time again, the young people of Somalia have proven to the world that they are resilient, that they have perseverance and they have the courage to come out of the pressing issues, challenges in their societies, in their communities,” she stated during her address. 

The UN envoy also expressed sympathy with victims of the 14 October bomb attack in Mogadishu that claimed more than 500 lives, and she lauded humanitarian assistance initiatives by youth in support of the victims. She also urged young Somalis to use positive means to resolve their problems.

“The right to participation is the right of all young people,” she said. “We should keep demanding that space and when that space is there, we should make good use of that opportunity and make sure that our priorities and concerns are well reflected.” Ms. Wickramanayake’s background makes her particularly well-suited to address the concerns of Somali youth. Prior to her appointment as the Secretary-General’s youth envoy, she was heavily involved in youth-related activities, including the launch of a movement for greater political and civic engagement of young people in her native Sri Lanka – a country which has suffered armed conflict and natural disasters in the recent past.

In her current role, she is expanding the UN’s engagement with youth and its advocacy efforts in the areas of sustainable development, human rights, peace and security and humanitarian action. “For us young people, peace is broader,” she said. “Peace is bigger. Peace is not just living without conflict. Peace is development, peace is being able to freely express ourselves. Peace is everything we do in our day-to-day lives and being able to do that without being restricted.”

In her closing remarks at the Somali National Youth Conference on Tuesday, the envoy shared three main findings from her stay in Mogadishu. Ms. Wickramanayake highlighted the unity demonstrated by the youth participants who came from all across the country, the fact that young people showed themselves to be the real peace-builders needed for Somalia’s future, and the strong desires of young Somalis to connect and share experiences with other youth from around the globe.

Describing the country’s young people as its “greatest asset,” she reassured the participants and the Somali Government of the world body’s ongoing support to ensure a brighter future for the country’s youth.

During her visit, the UN envoy’s other activities included meeting with a number of senior government officials, including Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire, the Minister of Youth and Sport, Khadijah Mohammed Diriye and the Mayor of Mogadishu, Thabit Mohamed Abdi, as well as representatives of civil society, and senior UN officials.

She also met with a diverse range of young Somalis, including representatives of youth organizations and networks, the members of the newly established National Youth Council, representatives of women’s groups, and entrepreneurs participating in an innovation workshop supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2383694,"Aid localisation as a catalyst for resilience during the post-Matthew response in Haiti *The following article is based on a study on aid localisation during the response to Hurricane Matthew which struck Haiti in October 2016. It draws on a series of interviews carried out in Haiti in May and June 2017. It presents how and why aid localisation is seen as a way of increasing resilience. It also analyses certain limits that were observed.*

Given the trauma and the lessons learned from the response to the 2010 earthquake, and particularly the relentless and recurring nature of the hurricanes that Haitian organisations face and will continue to face, most stakeholders quickly saw aid localisation during the response to Hurricane Matthew as legitimate and necessary. In this precise context, the different stakeholders involved in the response almost unanimously explain that they believe in aid localisation as a way of building the country’s resilience in relation to natural disasters and crisis situations. Three underlying factors of resilience are regularly mentioned when discussing the role and position of national and local actors during the response. These are: crisis preparedness, recovery and the long-term impact of the response.

**Localisation as a vector of crisis preparedness**

**Reinforcing risk and disaster management through the Directorate of Civil Protection**

Haiti’s national risk and disaster management system is more or less in place despite still not having a legal framework. The Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC), the public institution in charge of the operational management of risks and disaster, is not part of any organic law and therefore does not have its own budget, nor does it have genuine leadership status in relation to other public institutions. Its mission is to respond to disasters and also prevent and prepare for risks. It therefore played a central role in the preparations for Matthew, and considerable progress was made compared to the situation during the hurricanes in 2004 and 2008. This improvement is mainly the result of DPC’s reinforced operational capacity due to massive investment on the part of international donors and UN agencies in recent years.

During the 2016 hurricane season, the DPC carried out two simulation exercises involving the national and departmental emergency operations centres. One of these concerned the response to a hurricane in the regions that were hit by Matthew a few weeks later. These emergency operations centres were activated several days before the hurricane, which brought together numerous aid organisations (UN agencies and international NGOs) to prepare and coordinate their operations in collaboration with the DPC, before, during and after the hurricane.

International NGOs also provided the DPC with support, particularly at the commune and local level, in partnership with Haitian civil society organisations. However, though skills at this level were reinforced through training, operational means in “communes” and “sections communales” remained extremely weak. Yet, this local level proved to be essential, notably during the preparation phase. In addition to the warning and evacuation messages sent to the population by radio and text message, the volunteer staff of the civil protection force (and the Haitian Red Cross) covered the regions concerned to communicate security measures and indicate where provisional shelters were located using megaphones. At the “commune” and “section communale” levels, the civil protection committees and emergency operations centres are less formalised and are made up essentially of volunteers. Those who were mobilized during the passage of hurricane Matthew were therefore mostly inhabitants of the affected regions, and were both victims of the hurricane and among the first to provide assistance to their families and neighbours. This situation shows the permeability between public actors, civil society and the population at the local level, and, above all, illustrates that the localisation of the response to Matthew was also boosted by local actors themselves, first among which were the population and community leaders. It shows how fine the line is at the local level between localisation, participatory approaches and community engagement.

 

**Localisation as a way of preparing for future hurricanes**

The importance of preparedness in Haiti in June 2017 was all the more obvious because the country was about to enter a new hurricane season. All the organisations present in Haiti were therefore preoccupied by this preparation and conscious of the need to contribute to it in their operations in response to Matthew. For a certain number of organisations, such as those that had been involved in the 2010 earthquake response, localisation is primarily about recognizing the legitimacy and responsibility of the state as a key actor of the response, despite its limited capacity. Without denying the importance of pre-crisis preparation which aims to give national and local actors control of subsequent responses, localisation goes further because it consists of increasing the role of national and local actors concretely during a response and putting them back at the centre of the response. As such, the localisation of the response to Matthew (though insufficient according to many interviewees) has helped to build the capacity of Haitian actors (including civil society organisations who have been very involved in the response) through practical experience, and has helped to prepare them to cope with future crises. Thus, in this specific context where there are frequent hurricanes, aid localisation cannot be put off on the pretext that local and national actors do not have the necessary capacity or are insufficiently prepared. On the contrary, it is seen as a way of increasing preparation for future crises.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2383614,"ACT Alliance Concept Note IRQ181: Support to IDPs and their Host Communities – Follow on Response **Background**

The current crisis in Iraq began in June 2014, when militants of the Islamic State (ISIS) seized control of over one third of Iraq’s territory within a few weeks. Iraqi Security Forces, the Kurdish Peshmerga and various armed groups engaged in the fight against ISIS, and finally recaptured Ramadi in February 2016, Hīt in April 2016, Fallujah in June 2016, Mosul in July 2017, Tal Afar in August 2017 and Hawija in October 2017. The Government of Iraq announced the defeat of ISIS and regained full territorial control on 9 December.  

With the major military operations coming to end, many people are now able to return to their homes, and previously experienced large-scale displacements are likely to be over by 2018. However, smaller scale movements are still expected resulting from the tension between the government of Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government, triggered by the referendum on Kurdish independence on 25 September 2017.  

According to UN estimations, 8.7 million people will require some form of humanitarian assistance in 2018. In December 2017, the number of displaced persons is 2.8 million; the number of returnees is above 2.8 million. The humanitarian crisis in Iraq remains one of the largest and most volatile in the world, with a complex reality and rapidly changing vulnerabilities and serious economic problems.  
However, with the defeat of ISIS there is now a high chance of a protracted crisis with decreasing attention, while there is still great need for help in order to break the cycle that lead to the current events.",4601,"Recovery and Reconstruction"
2383479,"ETC Internet empowers Syrian refugees in Arbat camp If you ever have the opportunity of driving along the winding road that connects Erbil with Sulaymaniyah, the cultural capital of the Kurdistan Region, you will notice the multiple checkpoints and improvised markets that characterise the journey. On the three-hour trip to Sulaymaniyah, the ETC team drove under a sun-drenched orange sky.

As we found ourselves surrounded by the majestic Goyzha and Glazarda mountain ranges, Habib Shashati, a security telecommunications specialist from the World Food Programme’s (WFP) fast IT, telecommunications and coordination support services team (FITTEST), Muslih Abdullah, an ETC Information and Communications Technology (ICT) assistant and I realised we were entering Sulaymaniyah. Just 25 km past Sulaymaniyah city, we finally reached Arbat camp, home to over 7,000 Syrian refugees. Kids ran across unpaved paths while grown-ups went about their daily grocery shopping in the countless stores doting the main street set the scene of this bustling camp and captivated us.

Established in August 2013 as a transit site for Syrian refugees, not a shred of evidence exists nowadays in Arbat that suggests tents once populated the camp. Those temporary accommodations have given way to concrete block houses. The few things that have remained consistent throughout the camp are the shared Internet connectivity and security telecommunications services established by the ETC back in 2014 to enable humanitarian activities.

After more than three years supporting humanitarians, the ETC wanted to make a positive impact on the lives of the young Syrians residing in Arbat. In July 2017, the ETC started collaborating with WFP to extend Internet services to Arbat Community Centreto support [WFP’s Tech for Food pilot](http://innovation.wfp.org/project/tech-food). Under this pilot, 100 refugees were trained in July and August on basic digital skills including data entry, image annotation and Microsoft Office as well as learning English to link them after to working opportunities online.  

Before the second batch of 50 refugees start their classes in January 2018, the ETC wanted to conduct maintenance work on the Internet services to ensure a smooth end-user experience. Practice makes perfect. While these students attended the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani they needed a space in camp to work on what they had learned. ETC Internet services at the Community Centre allowed these refugees to consolidate their skills, keep their professional profiles up to date and look for jobs.

As soon as we arrived at the Community Centre in Arbat, we were welcomed by Sandra Raad, coordinating the Tech for Food project in Iraq. She explained that in the past two days, a significant number of young Syrians between 18 and 35 had taken an online skilled-based entry exam to apply for the next cycle of this programme. 

“Tech for Food is different from any other programme that Arbat residents have been involved in as it aims at improving their livelihoods, reducing the risk of social exclusion”, Sandra explained. 

When I went into the computer lab where the entry exams were taking place, I could feel the mix of anxiety and hope in the air. But even with their nerves on edge, these Syrians’ eyes sparkled with the chance at improving their career prospects.

Speaking Turkish, Arabic and Kurdish is not enough for Mahmod Kalo (34) from Qamishli who is now determined to learn English. “I work in construction and my boss speaks English”, he said. “Communicating with him in the same language will improve our relationship and expand the possibilities of working together in more projects”. English training is one of the attractive learning components offered by Tech for Food.

Born in Qamishli and raised in Damascus, Shaven Hassan Alali (21) came accompanied by her father who was strongly encouraging her to continue her education. “I want to gain technology-related skills as these are the most in-demand in today’s job market. This programme will help me get a better job in the future”, Shaven concluded.Speaking Turkish, Arabic and Kurdish is not enough for Mahmod Kalo (34) from Qamishli who is now determined to learn English. “I work in construction and my boss speaks English”, he said. “Communicating with him in the same language will improve our relationship and expand the possibilities of working together in more projects”. English training is one of the attractive learning components offered by Tech for Food.

Everybody deserves an opportunity to grow professionally, especially the most vulnerable ones. While the almost 190 prospective students who applied for the next edition of the Tech for Food are hoping to be accepted in the programme, the ETC will continue providing reliable Internet connectivity services to empower Syrian refugees in Arbat to help them reach their full potential.

In line with the [ETC2020 strategy](https://www.etcluster.org/project/etc2020) which aims at ensuring all those responding to emergencies, including affected populations, have access to vital communications services and digital aid and under the [ETC Services for Communities initiative (S4C)](https://www.etcluster.org/services/etc-services-communities), the ETC in Iraq is constantly looking into innovative ways to better assist the affected communities.

2383239,"Household and economy-wide impacts of a public works programme in Ethiopia For close to three decades, Ethiopia has been plagued by severe food shortages. Until the early 2000s, Ethiopia’s response to food insecurity primarily involved providing emergency food aid. While the emergency aid helped save lives, it did not increase people’s resilience or help avert food shortages. In 2005, the government launched the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) to help chronically poor rural populations create assets and become food self-sufficient. A component of the country’s Food Security Programme, the PSNP is reaching close to eight million people (10 per cent of the population) living in the woredas that are chronically food insecure. This reach makes it one of the largest public works programmes in Africa.  

The programme uses a combination of administrative and community-based approaches to identify beneficiary households.  

Historical administrative data is used to identify food-insecure woredas. Communities then play a crucial role in identifying food-insecure households and in updating the beneficiary list annually, based on locally identified criteria.

This brief draws on the findings from two impact evaluations that together assess PSNP holistically, exploring impacts both at the beneficiary household level and economy-wide impacts at the local and national level.

2389134,"Statement by Sweden at the UN Security Council Debate on UNAMA (21 December 2017) National Statement delivered by Ambassador Irina Schoulgin Nyoni on behalf of Sweden at the United Nations Security Council Debate on Afghanistan (UNAMA), 21 December 2017, New York.

Mr President,

I would like to align myself with the statement to be made later on behalf of the European Union and its member states.

Let me begin by thanking Special Representative Yamamoto, Executive Director Fedotov, and Ambassador Umarov for their comprehensive briefings. Let me also thank, in particular, Ms Wazhma Frogh, for bringing the voices of Afghan women into the chamber today.

Mr President,

The report of the Secretary-General underlines the continuing instability and volatility that affects the lives of the Afghan people on a daily basis. At the same time, as Special Representative Yamamoto has pointed out today, opportunities do exist to break the cycle of violence that has afflicted the country for four decades.

Mr President, I would like to make three points today.

Firstly, only the Afghan people, working together, will determine the future for Afghanistan. An Afghan owned and Afghan led peace process remains essential. Therefore, we welcome the Afghan government's strong commitment to engage in a political process.

The upcoming meeting in the Kabul process will be an important step towards creating an environment conducive to peace. We strongly encourage UNAMA to actively support the efforts of the Afghan government to ensure that the Kabul meetings result in a sustainable peace process.

During her visit to Afghanistan in October, the Swedish Foreign Minister met with representatives from all parts of society, and underlined the importance of an inclusive peace process. Ensuring that the whole population, meaning both men and women, can participate effectively is vital for the achievement of a sustainable peace, as is the active participation of civil society.

The regional context is important as many of the challenges facing Afghanistan cannot be dealt with in isolation. We urge all stakeholders, especially Afghanistan's neighbours, to assume responsibility and to work together towards a political settlement. There is tremendous potential in increased regional cooperation and we welcome the engagement of the central Asian states in this regard.

It is imperative for Afghanistan's future stability that parliamentary elections take place in 2018 and presidential elections in 2019, as announced, and that the elections are conducted in an inclusive, credible and transparent manner. Every effort must now be made to ensure difficulties are overcome and that elections take place.

We welcome the Secretary-General's emphasis in his report on women's participation in elections. We urge the electoral management bodies and the Afghan government to take all necessary steps to ensure women's full participation in the elections, both as voters and as candidates.

Mr President,

Secondly, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is vital to the achievement of sustainable peace. We congratulate Afghanistan on its election to the Human Rights Council. As an elected member of the Council, we expect Afghanistan to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights. We deplore the recent executions of five prisoners and urge the government to reinstate the de-facto moratorium on the death penalty, with a view to abolishing this cruel and inhumane punishment.

We appreciate the efforts of UNAMA in the area of human rights, not least pertaining to its work on children and armed conflict and civilian casualties. We encourage them to continue this important work.

Attacks against humanitarian and development workers, health-care professionals, medical transports, hospitals and other medical facilities as well as schools, continue and are deeply concerning. Such attacks not only impede efforts to aid the people of Afghanistan, but infringe the enjoyment of the right to education, health and life which are crucial in building sustainable peace. In addition, civilians continue to bear the burden of the conflict, with women and children increasingly under threat. We are deeply concerned by the increased recruitment of children by armed groups, in particular the Taliban, and call for an end to this practice.

Finally, Mr President,

I would like to reiterate our strong support for the outcome of the strategic review of UNAMA and the Secretary-General's recommendations. It is now important that these recommendations are implemented without delay. With its unique field presence, UNAMA can continue to make a tangible difference on the ground and provide important support for efforts to attain a lasting peace.

An integrated United Nations approach linking together peace, development and human rights work in Afghanistan is crucial to delivering results. Our expectations from UNAMA in this regard are high.

Mr President,

Sweden's assistance to the people of Afghanistan has remained steadfast for over three decades. Afghanistan is Sweden's single largest development cooperation partner, and our support will continue, including for reform efforts aimed at building strong and independent institutions. The Afghan people can count on our continued backing as they advance their efforts to build a peaceful, stable and inclusive future.

Thank you

SECURITY COUNCIL  
8145TH MEETING (AM) 

The Security Council today renewed the mandate of the United Nations force that monitors the Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights, for a period of six months, until 30 June 2018.

Unanimously adopting resolution 2394 (2017) on the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), the 15‑member body, condemning the use of heavy weapons by Syrian forces and armed groups in the area of separation, again emphasized that there should be no military activity in that area.

The Council welcomed UNDOF’s limited return to its Camp Faouar as well as planning for its return to vacated positions and commencement of limited patrols around the camp, given the provision of adequate protection based on continuous assessment.

It underscored the importance of deployment of capabilities to counter the threat of improvised explosive devices and other technology, as well as addressing civilian staffing needs, to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF personnel and equipment.

The meeting began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 10:10 a.m.

Resolution

The full text of resolution 2394 (2017) reads as follows:

“Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously observe the ceasefire,

“Concurring with the Secretary‑General’s findings that the ongoing military activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,

“Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement,

“Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other than those of UNDOF,

“Strongly condemning the continued fighting in the area of separation, calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the UNDOF area of operations and to respect international humanitarian law,

“Recognizing the necessity of efforts to flexibly adjust UNDOF’s posture on a temporary basis to minimize the security risk to UNDOF personnel as UNDOF continues to implement its mandate, while emphasizing that the ultimate goal is for the peacekeepers to return to their positions in UNDOF’s area of operations as soon as practicable,

“Emphasizing the importance of Security Council and troop-contributing countries having access to reports and information related to UNDOF’s current temporary configuration, and reinforcing that such information assists the Security Council with evaluating, mandating, and reviewing UNDOF and with effective consultation with troop‑contributing countries,

“Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, including technology and equipment to enhance its observation of the area of separation and the ceasefire line, and to improve force protection, as appropriate, and recalling that the theft of United Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other assets, and the looting and destruction of United Nations facilities, are unacceptable,

“Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service in an increasingly challenging operating environment, underscoring the important contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to peace and security in the Middle East, welcoming steps taken to enhance the safety and security of UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan, personnel, and stressing the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF and Observer Group Golan personnel,

2387474,"Mali - Humanitarian Brief (December 2017) More than five years after the escalation of conflict in northern Mali, progress has stagnated and new momentum is required to avoid a significant setback in Mali's recovery. The signature of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in 2015 opened a unique window of opportunity, but the Malian peace process has fallen short of expectations as implementation of the agreement remains delayed. Communities whose lives were shattered by the conflict have not yet seen tangible progress and remain highly vulnerable.

**INCREASING HUMANITARIAN NEEDS**

In 2017, the resurgence of intercommunal violence and clashes between armed groups triggered displacements and disrupted the livelihoods of thousands of families. Several communities affected by the conflict still struggle to access food, water, healthcare, education, protection and livelihood opportunities. In some areas, the persisting insecurity continues to prevent the deployment of State and development actors. For many families, humanitarian actors are the sole providers of essential services. The conflict has further exacerbated the vulnerability of communities, whose capacity to withstand shocks has been eroded by repetitive droughts, foods, epidemics and chronic poverty. Mali ranks 175 out of 188 countries in the Human Development Index.  

Emergency aid remains necessary to save lives and facilitate recovery. Government and development partners' efforts to address the root causes of chronic food insecurity, malnutrition and structural problems in the delivery of basic services will take years to demonstrate tangible results.  

In 2018, 4.1 million people, representing 22% of the Malian population, will be food insecure (up from 3.8 million in 2017), including 800,000 people who will require urgent food assistance.  
Malnutrition remains a serious concern, with 165,000 children projected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, and 115,000 pregnant or lactating women requiring nutrition assistance. In Mali, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 10.7% and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) rate of 2.6% exceed the emergency thresholds established by the World Health Organization of 10% and 2% for GAM and SAM, respectively.  

In addition, 908,000 million Malians, largely in northern regions, need water, sanitation and hygiene assistance. Lack of access to potable water constitutes a risk for conflict, as communities compete for limited water resources for themselves, but also for livestock and agricultural activities.  

About 500 schools (up from 300 during the same period last year) remain closed in central and northern Mali, and 2,700 teachers have not returned or been deployed to their posts due to insecurity and the influence of extremist groups opposing education. Central Mali is particularly affected with 277 schools closed in the Mopti region.  

Non-functional schools will affect the education of 300,000 children. Out of school children that cannot reintegrate the education system are exposed to higher recruitment risks by non-state armed actors and criminal groups. In particular, girls remain at higher risk of exposure to violence in the absence of access to education.",4602,"Safety and Security"
2387339,"Rising health worker abductions in Libya threaten fragile health system 21 December 2017, Sabha, Libya – When Dr Ahmad*, a surgeon at Sabha Medical Centre, was kidnapped in November by an unknown group, his colleagues decided to act. 

Dr Ahmad was the second health worker to be kidnapped within months in the town of 100 000 people. On 18 November, all non-essential health services at Sabha Medical Centre, the biggest hospital in southern Libya, were suspended for 10 days. 

“We went on strike after the kidnapping of Dr Ahmad because we wanted to send a message to Sabha’s authorities that doctors are in severe danger. Health services cannot operate properly if health workers are not safe,” said Dr Ayman*. 

Years of conflict have severely disrupted health services in Libya, and the recent rise in abductions of health workers threatens an already fragile health system. 

Of the 8 abductions documented by WHO in Libya since 2012, 4 occurred in 2017 alone, the highest number of kidnappings of health workers recorded in a single year. In Sabha, the abductions have had a significant impact on local access to health care. 

“The kidnappings are seriously affecting the health sector as there is a brain drain of health workers fleeing to safer cities. More than 10 professors at Sabha Medical School left because of poor security,” said Osama al-Wafi, spokesperson for Sabha Medical Centre. 

According to al-Wafi, only 2 days after Dr Ahmad’s abduction, an unknown group attempted to kidnap an internal medicine specialist, but the doctor managed to escape. 

It takes years of education and practice to train doctors, and southern Libya is running low on qualified health workers. 

“We have only 10 specialized doctors left in the town, which is facing an influx of thousands of migrants. We are trying our best to provide health services for everyone in need and the doctors are doing a great job despite the pressure, but I am not sure for how much longer,” al-Wafi added. 

Sabha’s health system has been further strained by the arrival of migrants making their way towards Libya’s northern coast and across the Mediterranean to Europe, many of whom seek treatment at local medical facilities. Dr Ahmad, a renowned surgeon in Sabha who operated on both locals and migrants, was released after 12 days in captivity. 

Many doctors and health workers are hesitant to speak out, afraid that they will be targeted next. One doctor who asked not to be named said that health workers in Sabha are sometimes targeted inside health facilities. 

“Many times there were shootings inside the emergency department; sometimes fights would start outside the hospital and then continue inside it. In May, one patient was shot on the operating table when armed men stormed the hospital,” she said. 

Sabha Medical Centre hires security guards to protect health workers, but even this is not enough. According to Sabha Medical Centre employees, two security guards were shot and killed in the street in May this year after they had left the hospital for the evening. 

On 1 January 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) is launching its Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care, a global data collection tool that will allow WHO to report on numbers and trends related to attacks on health workers and health facilities worldwide. The project is part of the Attacks on Healthcare project, a priority project of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme.

2387144,"Safeguarding health-care services: Will academia take up the challenge? Palacký University, in the Czech Republic, is setting a shining example of how academia can help tackle violence against health-care personnel and facilities. In May 2017, it hosted a conference to explore the issue from a Central and Eastern European perspective. Co-organized with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Czech Red Cross, it brought together representatives from governments, the military, the health-care sector, non-governmental organizations, other National Societies and academia. Now, it is incorporating key messages from the Health Care in Danger initiative into its curricula. We asked Ivana Oborna, vice-rector for international relations at the university, to tell us more.

**How did you learn about the Health Care in Danger initiative?**

I learned about the Health Care in Danger project a few years back, while attending a meeting on contemporary armed conflicts at the ICRC's headquarters in Geneva. I was not really aware of the issue of violence against health-care personnel and facilities before then. What struck me most was the scale of the problem and how much suffering it caused. It also became clear to me just how important it was to take steps to prepare for and prevent violence, in order to manage it better if and when it occurs; and how awareness-raising was fundamental to those efforts. As an academic, it immediately occurred to me that academia could play an important part in furthering this initiative.

What role can academia play in safeguarding health-care services?
Open discussions about the different facets of violence against health-care personnel and facilities – its causes, victims, perpetrators and impact – are needed to identify and create prevention and response mechanisms. Universities can provide a safe space for discussing such sensitive topics, even if ultimately the decisions have to be made elsewhere. Incorporating messages from the Health Care in Danger initiative into university curricula and making use of broader academic networks to raise awareness and share knowledge are also steps in the right direction.

It also became clear to me just how important it was to take steps to prepare for and prevent violence, in order to manage it better if and when it occurs

**Why did you decide to organize a conference on the issue?**

When I got back from Geneva after that meeting, I shared my initial thoughts with colleagues about how we could raise awareness of the issue of violence against health-care personnel and facilities. But there was another aspect that I had not considered. When we started discussing the issue with people in the Czech Republic, we discovered that lack of awareness was just part of the problem: another major challenge was the lack of coordination between different health services at the local and international levels (including civilian/military, pre-hospital/hospital and public/private services).

We had the idea of [organizing a conference at Palacký](http://cervenykriz.eu/cz/642/Olomouc_HCiD.pdf) University to bring all of these people together. We thought it would offer a platform for sharing experiences, discussing common challenges and exploring possible solutions between people who would not normally meet. Realizing that it would also be relevant to other countries in the region, we decided to open it out to include participants from across Central and Eastern Europe.

**Was it difficult to get people on board with the idea?**

It really differed from one person to another. For example, it took time for representatives from the government and the military to confirm their attendance because they needed approval from people higher up. It's important to factor in extra time for such people. It was a different story with universities, though: they were open to exploring new areas and partnerships, and the academics were quick to back the idea.

**What are the next steps in addressing violence against health-care personnel and facilities?**

First, we need to keep people engaged with the issue. Giving people the opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences, as we did at our conference, is an important part of that. It would definitely be worth replicating what we did across the academic network; I hope other universities will take up the challenge.

***""It seems that initiatives that link up the civilian and military spheres with civil and military health services are of interest not only to all the participants but also to the authorities. This is another way academia can help tackle violence against health workers.""***

We also need to find ways to publicize initiatives or events taking place in other countries, as these can sometimes pass by unnoticed. The Health Care in Danger initiative has launched a global [Community](http://community.healthcareindanger.org/join/?__hstc=246532443.06502b59de2e9ecf5b1ade8129050f75.1511538185390.1513243215568.1513857085659.5&__hssc=246532443.1.1513857085659&__hsfp=3417823315) of Concern, which includes an online platform for information-sharing, but even this is not widely known. The excellent CitizenAID initiative in the UK could serve as a model for getting the public more involved. It is important that we reflect on the experiences of others and build on lessons learned.

Approaches to addressing violence against health-care personnel and facilities need to be incorporated into the academic curricula of medicine, law, journalism, etc. This is something that we have already started doing at Palacký University: key messages from the Health Care in Danger initiative were incorporated into the core curriculum for the general medicine programme starting in autumn 2017. Another good example is Camp PEIRA, a real-life simulation of a refugee camp in a non-international armed conflict, organized by our law faculty in October 2017. It brought together students from different faculties (law, medicine, etc.) from our and other Czech universities, and representatives of the Czech Army, the Czech Red Cross, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the ICRC. It was very well received. It seems that initiatives that link up the civilian and military spheres with civil and military health services are of interest not only to all the participants but also to the authorities. This is another way academia can help tackle violence against health workers.

Health Care in Danger is an initiative of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to make access to, and delivery of, health care safer in armed conflict or other emergencies. This initiative calls for the respect and protection of health-care workers, facilities and vehicles and the implementation of a series of recommendations and practical measures to safeguard health-care services and their humanitarian mission. This initiative is supported by a number of partners, individuals and organisations, members of the Health Care in Danger Community of Concern.

2386959,"Not a Target: Ensuring the Protection of Aid Workers *Melanie Sauter*

**Summary**

Violence against aid workers has become a major concern for most humanitarian agencies. At the same time, compliance with and respect for international humanitarian law (IHL) is deteriorating. Irregular warfare, meaning governments fighting armed groups mostly in their own territory, has become the norm. These modern wars pose a challenge to the enforcement of international law. The prevailing culture of impunity stimulates non-compliance with IHL for all conflict parties. As long as they are being targeted, aid agencies cannot effectively operate and help the most vulnerable. This is why the law protecting humanitarians needs to be standardized and better reporting and monitoring mechanisms are required.",4602,"Safety and Security"

The six aid workers, including one international and five national staff, working with Solidarités International, HealthNet TPO, and AFOD, are all accounted for. The Humanitarian Coordinator commends all those who worked to ensure the safe return of the NGO staff and particularly the efforts of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP).

The Humanitarian Coordinator reminded all parties of their obligation to respect the neutrality of on-going humanitarian operations and facilitate safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers providing life-saving aid to vulnerable people throughout the country. These aid agencies were implementing food assistance, livelihoods, health, and nutrition interventions in an area heavily impacted by food insecurity and malnutrition.

**GENEVA, 19 December 2017 -** 2017 has been a very difficult year for the children and women in CAR, and sadly we are not expecting the situation to improve in the coming months.  
  
2017 has seen a dramatic increase in violence- the previously unstable regions, such as the center and the north west, have remained very tense. In addition, the entire south west- that had previously been spared by the crisis, is now the worst hit region.  
  
Humanitarian access is constantly hampered by criminal and armed groups activities. This year only, 14 aid workers have lost their lives in the country, and the aid organizations had to temporarily suspend their activities in several locations throughout 2017.    
  
Children and women are of course the first victims: half of CAR population is in need of humanitarian support, that is 2.5 million people, including 1.3 million children.  
  
With 601,000 IDPs (same numbers as in early 2014) and 538,000 refugees abroad, this means that more than 1 in 5 Central Africans have been forced away from home.  
  
**A few examples**  

- Currently 20% of the schools are closed because of insecurity; the schools that are open have too many pupils and not enough teachers- half of the teachers are community supported and not officially certified- so there is a long way to go if we want to ensure quality education.  

- Reports of children’s rights violations are on the rise- in 2017, 50% more documented incidents than the previous year, twice the number of children recruited into armed groups-  And we know that the verified numbers are only the tip of the iceberg because of restrictions on humanitarian access.  

- Immunization campaigns have been disrupted in several regions due to persistent insecurity  

- Basic healthcare needs are not met -especially in regions where the NGOs are no longer able to operate.  
  
As UNICEF Representative, I am very concerned about the lasting impact this crisis is having on children. We have a whole generation at risk of growing up traumatized, without proper education, without healthcare and constantly exposed to the most horrific violence.  
  
**UNICEF Response**  

In these extremely difficult conditions, UNICEF does whatever it takes to deliver:  
  
- Education: temporary learning spaces for over 50,000 children in 2017- we are hoping for more in 2018 (85,000). We are also working with the Ministry of Education to improve quality of education.  
- Protection: 1,900 children released from armed groups in 2017 only (over 10,000 since 2014); BUT we need money to provide them with reintegration support. (Just half of them have received the whole package)  
- RRM (Rapid Response Mechanism): through partners that are able to react when there is a humanitarian shock in remote areas, we have been able to provide Non Food Items (mats, mosquito nets, blankets, cooking supplies etc) to close to 25,000 households and emergency water and sanitation interventions to almost 72,000 people  
  
This is a critical time for funding.  
  
This year we received less than half (46%) the funding needed to meet the humanitarian needs. In 2018 the needs are growing: we are going to need every support we can get, if we do not want the children of CAR to be left to a terrible fate.

**Massive displacements in Nangarhar**

Following a series of clashes over the past months between two competing non-state armed groups in Khogyani district, Nangarhar, intense fighting erupted mid-October provoking the displacement of more than 40,000 people in just a few days to Khogyani district centre, Behsud, Chamtala, Chaparhar, Pachieragam and Surkh Rod districts, as well as Jalalabad City (see map on next page). Renewed fighting at the end of November led to another wave of displacement, forcing several thousand people from two dozen villages.  
To date, more than 61,000 people have been displaced from Khogyani district.

**Less than two hours to flee their home and find transport to safety**

“There was fighting everywhere around our village and we decided to leave,” said one man who recently arrived in Surkh Rod district centre, 25 kilometres from the Khogyani district centre. “We walked at night because we thought it would be safer. But still one of us got struck by a bullet.” Abdul Jalil, who fled his village in Khogyani district two weeks ago, remembered: “We had less than two hours to get ready.” The mason was lucky enough to be able to afford to pay for transport and packed his wife, five children and a mattress into the taxi. “I paid US$90 to get here, three times the usual price.”

This chilly morning, he waited at a food distribution site organised by the NGO Afghan Planning Agency (APA), a national NGO-partner of the World Food Programme (WFP), fidgeting with the paper slip between his fingers that identified him as one of 300 heads of family who would receive a monthly food ration. Almost 5,500 families have already received either food or cash assistance intended to buy food.

The director of the clinic, Dr. Samiullah, confirms the added pressure that the displaced families are putting on the existing health services: since mid-October, when the first influx of displaced families from Khogyani arrived in Surkh Rod, the number of patients treated increased from an average of 4,000 to 7,000 per month. Most of the consultations are for respiratory diseases.

However, the number of trauma cases has significantly increased from only a few per month mostly caused by road traffic accidents to around 200 per month. “The majority of them are gunshot wounds,” the doctor observed.",4602,"Safety and Security"
2381544,"UK National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security 2014 to 2017: report to Parliament (December 2017) **This report sets out the cross-Government action that the UK has taken to improve gender equality, tackle sexual violence in conflict, and protect vulnerable people in conflict zones from sexual exploitation and abuse.**

We are proud that the UK continues to lead the world on the Women, Peace and Security agenda, delivering on our commitments under our National Action Plan through practical support, diplomatic action, and funding. 

Our action to improve gender equality takes a number of forms. A key aspect of it has been promoting the participation of women in political processes and in mediation roles, for example we have supported women’s participation in the Syrian, Somalian and Colombian Peace Processes. Since February, the FCO’s first ever Special Envoy for Gender Equality, Joanna Roper, has also been leading work to deliver the Foreign Secretary’s vision of a foreign policy that consciously and consistently delivers for women and girls. 

Another aspect has been our ongoing work to protect vulnerable people by improving peacekeeping. Over the last three years the MOD has delivered pre-deployment training on gender and international humanitarian law to more than 7,000 peacekeepers from African countries annually. At the UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial in London in 2016, the UK recognised the indispensable role of women in peacekeeping, and we have continued to work with countries from across the world to increase the number of women deployed to peacekeeping missions. 

In partnership with the Canadian and Bangladeshi Chiefs of Defence, the Vice Chief of Defence Staff, General Sir Gordon Messenger launched the new WPS Chiefs of Defence Staff Network at the UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial in Vancouver in November 2017. The network aims to promote the integration of gender perspectives into military planning and operations, and to improve the participation of women in armed forces and peacekeeping. These aims are reflected in the practices the UK armed forces are already adopting. 

The importance of our work on gender is referenced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review. It is also evident in ongoing work to incorporate gender perspectives into National Security country strategies on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, gender perspectives are included in the design phase of all development programmes and all Conflict, Stability and Security Fund projects.  

The Government’s pioneering Prevention of Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) continues to support survivors of sexual violence in conflict around the world and to deliver justice for the crimes they have suffered. At the UN General Assembly in September, we launched the Principles for Global Action on tackling the stigma of Sexual Violence in Conflict as part of our #EndStigma campaign. DFID’s wider work to prevent and address Violence Against Women and Girls includes specific activity on tackling all forms of violence in conflict and emergency situations including intimate partner violence.  
As part of this agenda we are funding ground-breaking research to generate new evidence on what works to inform UK and international efforts.  

We are also taking action to tackle Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) of adults and children in conflict areas, recognising that these despicable crimes are committed not only by peacekeepers but also by civilians within the agencies and organisations sent to protect the vulnerable. In September the Prime Minister joined the UN Secretary General’s Circle of Leadership, which was set up to rid UN peacekeeping operations and agencies of sexual exploitation and abuse. As a sign of our resolve, we have made the UK’s future core funding to UN and other development and humanitarian agencies dependent on a zero-tolerance approach to this issue.  

Our three Departments have worked closely together with the Stabilisation Unit to deliver the outcomes of the NAP over the last three years. Many of the achievements described in this report have been made possible by the collaboration of other governments, international organisations and civil society groups. We take this opportunity to thank all our international partners for their continuing co-operation and support.  

Looking ahead, it is clear that there is still a great deal to do. Women continue to be marginalised from post-conflict political settlements, excluded from negotiations and underrepresented in UN peacekeeping operations. Too often the needs of women in humanitarian situations are overlooked.  
In short, the promise of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 remains unfulfilled. We remain steadfast in our commitment to that resolution and subsequent resolutions. We must stay the course and continue to put women and girls at the centre of international peace and security efforts. This commitment is reflected in the next National Action Plan which sets out Government’s WPS agenda up to 2022. The importance of our work on gender is referenced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review. It is also evident in ongoing work to incorporate gender perspectives into",4602,"Safety and Security"

At the same time, several neighborhoods of the city of Damascus continue to be affected by the hostilities.**

Scores of civilians have been killed or injured since the latest spike in hostilities began on 14 November, with many civilian objects and houses being affected. Under International humanitarian law, these places must be spared during fighting.

""The humanitarian situation in Eastern Ghouta has reached a critical point. As so often in Syria over the last 6 years, ordinary people are once again trapped in a situation where life slowly becomes impossible and where goods and aid are severely limited,"" said the ICRC's Middle East director, Robert Mardini.

In addition, medical workers on the ground report hundreds of sick and wounded people are deprived from life-saving medical care. The cold weather threatens to further deteriorate the situation. With almost no fuel available, people have very little access to proper heating, further risking their health.

""Chronic disease sufferers and people with severe injuries are struggling to access care. The sick and injured must not be used as pawns in negotiations between the different parties involved in the fighting. Medical attention must be promptly given to those who need it irrespective of who they are,"" said Mr. Mardini.

The civilian population in Eastern Ghouta is also facing a frightening food shortage and a huge increase in food prices.

""Some families can afford to eat only one meal a day, an especially sad situation for people with children. As a result, most people have been relying entirely on aid from humanitarian organizations,"" added Mr. Mardini.

""All warring parties must reach a solution that puts civilians first and allows humanitarian aid to reach the population on a regular basis. No military or political gains could justify this amount of suffering, whether in Eastern Ghouta or elsewhere in Syria.""

2380169,"UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria gravely concerned by ambush on convoy carrying humanitarian items in Borno State (Abuja, 18 December 2017): The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kallon, strongly deplores the deadly ambush on a convoy carrying humanitarian food supplies for conflict-affected persons on Saturday 16 December, and expressed grave concern over the limitations that attacks of this nature may have on the delivery of life-saving supplies to people in need in north-east Nigeria.

The armed ambush by a non-state armed group took place on the road between Dikwa and Gamboru, in Borno State, and resulted in the reported loss of at least four civilian lives as well as the destruction of basic aid items initially destined to alleviate the suffering of thousands of women, children and men.

""Violence against convoys carrying humanitarian aid is unacceptable and can result in concerning limitations in our ability to provide life-saving relief to those who need it the most,"" said Mr. Edward Kallon. ""We must ensure the safety of aid workers and aid convoys across the north-east of Nigeria, so people in need of assistance can access it in a timely manner and in sufficient quantity. Many lives are at risk,"" he added.

The United Nations and its partners operate in the north-east of Nigeria in order to provide life-saving assistance to 6.9 million people affected by the brutal conflict. Humanitarian operations are carried out following the four basic humanitarian principles of operational independence, humanity, impartiality and neutrality and should be respected as such.

Since January 2017, despite major challenges, humanitarian operations in north-east Nigeria have managed to assist over 5 million conflict-affected people in the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, including 3 million with food security interventions, 936,000 with nutritional support, 5 million with health care assistance, and over 1.3 million with safe drinking water.",4602,"Safety and Security"
2379269,"Statement by humanitarian organizations in Yemen on allegations of corruption and bias in the provision of relief assistance, 17 December 2017 As humanitarian organizations working in Yemen we condemn in the strongest possible terms the allegations of corruption and bias in the provision of relief assistance that continue to be put forward by the parties to the conflict in Yemen without proper substantiation.  

United in our commitment to humanitarian action that preserves the life and dignity of people in need, we continue to provide assistance in Yemen in full respect of humanitarian principles, including impartiality, humanity, neutrality and operational independence. Rigorous oversight mechanisms are in place to ensure the highest standards of aid delivery and accountability towards the affected population. When incidents of aid diversion have occurred, we have engaged, at the highest level, with authorities and local leaders to ensure that humanitarian principles are understood and respected so that people in need receive the assistance to which they are entitled.  

In fulfilling the humanitarian imperative to save and protect the lives of the most vulnerable, we maintain neutrality in our work and do not take sides with any of the parties to the conflict. Proximity to population in need is a critical consideration in the establishment of the operational presence and programmatic footprint. Unimpeded humanitarian access is essential to assess vulnerabilities, implement and monitor an effective response. We denounce any attempt to interfere in the delivery of aid as undermining the independence of humanitarian action.  

Our staff work under very difficult circumstances in an extremely volatile environment to provide emergency food and nutrition, health, water, shelter and protection assistance to millions of people whose survival is treated by all parties to the conflict as a collateral factor in a war fought in utter disregard for international humanitarian law.  

Unfounded accusations levelled at the humanitarian community threaten the safety and protection of humanitarian workers and compromise our ability to respond at a time when our work is most needed.  

Ongoing violence across Yemen has left more than 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid and protection. In less than three years, more than 60,000 people have been killed or injured and 17.8 million have been left without access to enough food each day. Over eight million people depend on relief assistance to stay alive. The protracted blockade on the importation of commercial goods through Yemen’s main seaports is further exacerbating a dire crisis, propelling millions of people towards starvation. Behind every one of these catastrophic numbers is an individual who relies on the humanitarian community to sustain themselves.  

Yemen cannot wait, time for action is now. All the parties to the conflict in Yemen, and those with influence over them, should put the lives and survival of the millions of innocent civilians at the forefront. Much more should be done to ensure respect for international humanitarian law and the protection of the civilian population, and to facilitate unimpeded access to people in need.  

Humanitarian organizations will continue to deliver assistance to those who need it, but we know that aid is not the answer for Yemen. A political solution is more urgent than ever to stop the unnecessary suffering of millions of Yemenis.

538,432 Refugees in neighbouring countries (Chad, Cameroon, DRC, Congo) (UNHCR, 31 Oct 2017)

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

The explosion of violence of the last spring in the South Eastern part of the country (Bangassou, Zémio) has continued to spread into the Center East during November. For example, on the axis Dimbi-Kembe-Pompolo, over 17,000 new displaced persons were identified following rumours and then fighting between armed groups. This axis is a corner stone for humanitarian access to the East of the country and only a few local NGOs are now able to intervene with MINUSCA Force protection.  

In Bria (North East), the security situation is remains worrying. The confrontations between armed groups have caused populations to be displaced repeatedly. The displaced children and families in the PK3 Bria IDP site increased by 24 per cent between September and November (26,747 to 35,499) resulting in an estimated total of about 60,000 IDPs in Bria.  

In the Western region, the sub-prefectures of Bocaranga, Koui and Ngaoudaye have been affected by several peaks of violence forcing the population to be displaced several times since the beginning of 2017. The humanitarian partners in the area have been forced to suspend their activities several times, particularly in Bocaranga, at the end of September. Following a military MINUSCA intervention at the end of October in the area, approximately 15,000 previously displaced persons spontaneously returned to Bocaranga throughout the month of November. Humanitarian partners began resuming activities in the area early in November.",4602,"Safety and Security"
2376714,"Four Years Into South Sudan Conflict, Hunger and Malnutrition Continue to Rise **JUBA (15 December 2017)** – Four years after the beginning of the South Sudan conflict, the leading humanitarian organization CARE is deeply concerned by the risk of famine as rates of hunger and malnutrition continue to rise. Presently, seven million South Sudanese are in need of lifesaving assistance – deeply affected by conflict, displacement, hunger and a collapsing economy.

“This year, ongoing violence against the civilian population – coupled with unmet humanitarian needs – has resulted in hundreds of thousands of people moving within South Sudan and across the borders to Uganda and South Sudan,” said Fred McCray, CARE country director in South Sudan. “Women and girls have bore the brunt of violence during this conflict, including many during their journey to safety in neighboring countries.”

The surge in over 2 million South Sudanese civilians fleeing violence increased the pressure on neighboring countries, such as Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya, to provide humanitarian assistance. CARE applauds the communities that have sheltered thousands of refugees seeking safety and worked hand-in-hand with aid agencies to meet the basic needs of affected people.

In the first months of 2018, 4.8 million people – more than half of the population – will face severe food insecurity, while half of all South Sudanese children under five currently experience acute malnutrition. While the increase in donor support for humanitarian operations has played a pivotal role in preventing famine from being declared in South Sudan, continued humanitarian support – coupled with diplomatic engagement in an inclusive and sustainable peace process – is essential to secure the future of the South Sudanese population.

“We call on all parties to the conflict to allow unfettered access to the most vulnerable people, thousands of whom are already experiencing famine-like conditions in South Sudan. Without a permanent ceasefire and a sustainable peace agreement, the humanitarian community is not able to provide lifesaving assistance to those who urgently need it,” says McCray.

Attacks and apparent impunity for violence against humanitarian workers and aid convoys have exacerbated the increasing insecurity in South Sudan. Furthermore, bureaucratic impediments have diminished the resources available for humanitarian assistance. While the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has focused its engagement on protecting civilians and creating conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance, it must be strengthened further in 2018 in order to prevent famine.

The use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war by parties to the conflict has created untold trauma among civilians. Investments in health and protection programming will be critical to support the needs of South Sudanese women and girls, along with their families and community members, in order to work toward progress and end the cycle of violence in South Sudan.

To date, CARE has reached over a half million people in need of lifesaving assistance with food, livelihood assistance, health care, protection from gender-based violence and peacebuilding interventions.

Founded in 1945, CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. CARE places special focus on working alongside poor girls and women because, equipped with the proper resources, they have the power to lift whole families and entire communities out of poverty.

2376534,"Dominican Republic: Hurricane Irma (MDRDO010) DREF Operation Update (14 December 2017) **A. Situation analysis**

**Description of the disaster** 

Hurricane Irma impacted the Dominican Republic from Wednesday, 6 September 2017 through Thursday, 7 September. The eye of the storm passed north-east of the coastline of the country, creating storm surge along the country’s northern coast and causing wind and flood damage to vulnerable communities, resulting in higher than usual rainfall; additionally, tropical storm winds were felt 270 km away from the hurricane’s eye in Santo Domingo. The hurricane impacted coastal towns and mountainous areas, particularly vulnerable communities in rural areas. In addition to the effects of Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria struck the northern area of the country on 14 September 2017, worsening the conditions of the population already affected by Irma. 

**Summary of the current response** 

**Overview of Host National Society** 

In anticipation of a direct impact from Hurricane Irma, the Dominican Red Cross activated its internal disaster response protocols in coordination with the national disaster response system; the National Society also carried out national assessments before the storm to identify critical areas that were likely to pose a challenge to its response activities.  

Additionally, the DRC activated the Community Disaster Response Teams (Community Networks) to respond to a potential emergency. Finally, the National Society readied its emergency stock, equipment (21 water purification units, 5 water trucks) and emergency teams (Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis [DANA], water and sanitation [WATSAN], psychosocial support (PSS), search and rescue, first aid and restoring family links [RFL]), and the National Society distributed relief items to initially support 2,096 families affected by Hurricane Irma.  

After the passage of the Hurricane, the National Society deployed five DANA teams to the most affected provinces ((Montecristi, Santiago, Puerto Plata, Duarte, Espaillat, Dajabón, El Seybo, San Pedro de Macorís, La Altagracia, María Trinidad Sánchez y Samaná) and the Santo Domingo Province to conduct rapid evaluations, which took place from 8 September until mid-November 2017.  
The United Nations (UN) Country Team, in support of the government, conducted a multi-sectorial DANA, and the National Society supported the assessment through the provision of DANA-trained volunteers and vehicles.  

The DRC HAS distributed non-food items (NFIs) to 3,000 to families affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, such as Hygiene Kits, cooking kits, long-lasting insecticide treated [mosquito] nets (LLITNs) and repellent. The DRC’s water and sanitation teams have been able to produce and distribute 3,288,758 liters of water in the municipalities of Miches, El Seybo, Gaspar Hernandez and Ramon Santana throughout the emergency, benefiting 312,257 families.  

**Overview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country** 

The IFRC and Partner National Societies (PNSs) do not have a physical presence in country; consequently, the Caribbean country cluster office in Haiti and the IFRC’s regional office for the Americas (ARO) in Panama have deployed an operations coordinator and an information management (IM) officer to the DRC. Additionally, the Canadian Red Cross Society deployed a delegate to support a Real-Time Evaluation (RTE) of the National Society’s response.  Lastly, the Spanish Red Cross has been closely monitoring the situation, and it is ready to provide support either from its country office in Haiti or its national headquarters in Spain.

ARO declared an orange alert for the event on 6 September 2017, and coordination was established between the Dominican Red Cross, Latin Caribbean country cluster, and ARO. To provide more comprehensive support to the National Society, both the Country Cluster team in Haiti and ARO office moved three delegates (coordination, planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting [PMER] and information technology [IT]), who accompanied the relevant National Societies activities in their response to the hurricane. Finally, ARO developed a [Dashboard](https://app.klipfolio.com/published/cae9469a2fec77694b12137f7cffbf09/dc-aro-op-3) to monitor the storm’s progress.

2375909,"Fact Sheet NE Nigeria: Bama, Bama LGA (as of 12 December 2017) **Background**

- The Bama local government area (LGA) has been severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria.

- Bama town, the second largest in the state of Borno, was repeatedly attacked from May 2013 through September 2014 and finally seized by non-state armed groups, who turned it into their headquarters. Relatively close to the border with Cameroon, it was once a thriving commercial hub and home to 250,000 people.

- While the Nigerian armed forces regained control of the LGA in March 2015, the civilian administration has not yet officially returned. The LGA chairman visits regularly to support the ongoing humanitarian and recovery efforts.

- An informal settlement established and controlled by the military in the General Hospital site has been hosting about 15,200 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in extremely dire and congested conditions. International humanitarian aid started reaching them in June 2016. IDPs from other parts of the north-east continue to arrive weekly to Bama town.

- A new camp has been established at the Government Senior Secondary School in Bama town to help decongest the first site.  
Relocation to this new camp started on 11 December 2017.  
Humanitarians are working to ensure that all basic services are availed in this new site as soon as possible.

- The state government has embarked on a large-scale reconstruction of the LGA – the so-called “Bama Initiative” - to lay the foundation for the safe and voluntary return of displaced persons when the conditions are conducive.

- The security situation in Bama LGA remains volatile, and concerns regarding the protection of civilians are high. Freedom of movement is severely restricted.

**Humanitarian Access**

- The only locations which have a permanent humanitarian presence in Bama LGA are Bama town and Banki. Insecurity is completely preventing access to locations outside of those two towns.

- Humanitarian cargo and personnel can reach Bama town by road from Konduga with the use of armed escorts as a last resort. Aid workers can also be transported by helicopter thanks to the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS).

- In May 2017, the construction of a humanitarian hub started.  
The hub became operational in August, and has since been facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance and its coordination by providing aid workers with secure accommodation and internet connectivity

**Humanitarian Situation**

- For the past two years, IDPs in Bama town have been living in one informal, congested and closed site, based at the former General Hospital site. The informal camp hosts over 12,250 persons (about 3,400 women, 2,100 men, 5,300 girls and 4,450 boys). They come largely from other parts of the Bama LGA, namely Kumshe, Nduguno, Dipchari, Jere and Dar-Jama.

- The number of new arrivals reported in November and December is 187 people. Newly arriving IDPs are being screened by the military before being integrated into the camp, with the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and humanitarian partners, where they received life-saving assistance. As of early December, over 3,000 people did not have shelters and were staying outside or in makeshift structures.

- A new site has been set-up at the location of the Government Senior Secondary School with close to 2,700 shelters built by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the construction of over 2,250 shelters is underway by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The relocation of families to decongest the General Hospital site is to start in midDecember, but many challenges remain such as: security concerns, the poor quality of some shelters which do not abide by basic internationally-recognised basic standards, and the establishment of proper WASH facilities and services.

- In terms of health care needs, cases of acute respiratory infections, measles and malnutrition are regularly reported. There is a lack of ambulances to facilitate the referral of patients to Maiduguri for complex medical issues.",4602,"Safety and Security"
2374824,"Lake Chad Snapshot: Issue 3 (October - November 2017) The world’s most overlooked crisis in the Lake Chad Basin continues to affect the North-East of Nigeria, the Far North Region of Cameroon, the Lac Region of Chad and the Diffa Region in Niger with 17 million people living in these areas. This complex and protracted humanitarian crisis has resulted in the displacement of more than 2.3 million people, half of them are children.

Civilians are deliberately targeted. Cross-border raids by insurgents and suicide bombings have increased during the last two months. These attacks are directly affecting Plan International’s programme implementation across the Lake Chad region.

Protection issues are of grave concern with evidence of violence against children as well as all worst forms of child labour. Hundreds of cases of sexual violence, physical aggression and other violations continue to be reported. Women and girls face unabated gender based violence - they have been targeted, abducted and held hostage, raped or forced into marriage.

Michelle Delaney | Sr. Media Adviser, Norwegian Refugee Council | Oslo | Mobile: +47 941 65 579 | Email: michelle.delaney@nrc.no

The past twelve months have seen a sharp rise in the number of people fleeing their homes and in urgent need of emergency food assistance. The conflict continues to take a heavy toll on civilians. 

""Four years after the beginning of conflict in South Sudan, the situation continues to deteriorate with little hope for improvement,"" said Rehana Zawar, Norwegian Refugee Council's Country Director in South Sudan. ""Civilians, mostly women and children, bear the brunt of the violence as conflict continues to escalate in many areas of the country. Farmers are afraid to tend their crops. Women face risk of sexual violence on a daily basis when going to collect water or firewood for cooking. Hundreds of thousands of children can no longer access school due to insecurity and economic hardship.""

Six months ago, a massive humanitarian response addressed the famine that broke in the country. Today, an estimated 4.8 million people in South Sudan still face severe food insecurity - an increase of 1.1 million from last year. Risk of famine resurgence remains a real prospect in 2018 in many areas across South Sudan against the backdrop of violence and insecurity.

Recently, more than 45 people, including six aid workers, were killed in a remote village in Duk county in the east of the country. Unidentified armed men also abducted over fifty women and children, burned homes, and looted humanitarian warehouses. This single violent attack resulted in the displacement of over 2,000 civilians seeking safety in the neighboring town. The overall number of South Sudanese forced to flee their homes due to the conflict has risen in a year from 3.25 million people[[1]](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ss_170531_2016_humanitarian_response_in_review.pdf) to 4 million according to the latest OCHA official numbers.[[2]](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/171208_OCHA_SouthSudan_humanitarian_bulletin_18.pdf)

""Fighting and violence pushes increasing numbers of families to flee their homes, walking for days in search of safety, food, shelter and other basic services. Children often get separated in the process. While South Sudanese show remarkable resilience in a deteriorating context, millions depend on emergency assistance from humanitarian organizations for their survival,"" said Rehana Zawar.

The Norwegian Refugee Council urges all parties to the conflict to suspend hostilities, ensure protection of civilians, engage in meaningful dialogue, work towards a lasting peace and ensure safer access to vulnerable populations in need. By this time next year, we hope that South Sudan will have a real and lasting peace.

2373424,"World Humanitarian Data and Trends 2017 **Introduction**

World Humanitarian Data and Trends presents global and country-level data-and-trend analysis about humanitarian crises and assistance. Its purpose is to consolidate this information and present it in an accessible way, providing policymakers, researchers and humanitarian practitioners with an evidence base to support humanitarian policy decisions and provide context for operational decisions.  
The information presented covers two main areas: humanitarian needs and assistance in 2016, and humanitarian trends, challenges and opportunities.  

The report intends to provide a comprehensive picture of the global humanitarian landscape, and to highlight major trends in the nature of humanitarian crises, their drivers, and the actors that participate in prevention, response and recovery. The 2017 edition of the report builds on previous iterations of the report, providing an overview of 2016 as well as selected case studies that can be used for humanitarian advocacy.  

There are many gaps in the available information due to the complexity of humanitarian crises. Even the concepts of humanitarian needs and assistance are flexible. There are also inherent biases in the information. For example, assistance provided by communities and by local and national Governments is less likely to be reported. The outcomes and impact of assistance are difficult to measure and rarely reported. Funding data is more available than other types of information. There are also limitations on the availability and quality of data. Further information on limitations is provided in the ‘User’s Guide’.  

The data presented in this report is from a variety of source organizations with the mandate, resources and expertise to collect and compile relevant data, as well as OCHA-managed processes and tools, such as the inter-agency appeal process and the Financial Tracking Service (FTS). All the data presented in this report is publicly available through the source organizations and through the report’s own data set (available through the Humanitarian Data Exchange).  

Further information on data sources is provided in the ‘User’s Guide’.  

World Humanitarian Data and Trends is an initiative of the Policy Analysis and Innovation Section of OCHA’s Policy Development and Studies Branch.  

This report is just one part of OCHA’s efforts to improve data and analysis on humanitarian situations worldwide and build a humanitarian data community.  

This edition of the report was developed with internal and external partners, whose contributions are listed in the ‘Sources and References’ section. OCHA extends its sincere gratitude to all those partners for their time, expertise and contributions.  

Interpreting the visuals and data The report uses many visual representations of humanitarian data and trends. There is also some limited narrative text and analysis, which provides basic orientation and helps to guide individual interpretation. However, there may be multiple ways to interpret the same information.  

The ‘User’s Guide’ contains more detailed methodological information and specific technical notes for each figure. Readers are encouraged to refer to the technical notes for more detailed descriptions of decisions and assumptions made in presenting the data.

2370759,"South Sudan: Humanitarian Access Snapshot (November 2017) **OVERVIEW**

November was the most dangerous month for humanitarian workers in South Sudan since December 2013, with nine killed, including six in Duk, Jonglei, one in Ikotos, Eastern Equatoria and two in Awerial, Lakes. A total of 103 humanitarian access incidents were reported in November, compared to 116 in October. Six security incidents forced the suspension of aid activities in different locations. During the month, local authorities in various locations continued to demand involvement in NGO staff recruitment and procurement processes.

**IMPACT**

Incidents of violence, some of which led to the death of aid workers, substantially disrupted aid operations forcing the suspension of response activities in multiple locations. Fighting forced the relocation of at least 47 aid workers in six incidents in Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei, and Unity. Two NGOs temporarily suspended food security, livelihoods and health response, following the violence in Duk County. Nearly 2.4 metric tons of food items were looted and a warehouse was vandalized by armed groups during the attack. In Iholong, Eastern Equatoria, agencies suspended multi-sectoral assistance following insecurity. In Bentiu (Unity), the Rubkona County government blocked access to the waste disposal site, which resulted in heightened health risks for more than112,100 IDPs in the Bentiu PoC site. In southern Unity, fighting forced the relocation of aid workers and the suspension of food and nutrition assistance to nearly 34,000 people. The announcement of new work permit rates could see nearly US$7 million, meant for people in need, diverted to fees.",4602,"Safety and Security"
2369954,"Condemning Attacks on Aid Efforts, General Assembly Adopts Package of Texts, One Urging States to Better Protect Humanitarian Workers, Respect International Law GA/11991

General Assembly Plenary    
Seventy-second Session, 70th & 71st Meetings (AM & PM)  

The General Assembly today adopted seven draft resolutions, among them texts on credentials, the culture of peace and on strengthening the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance.

Condemning in the strongest possible terms the alarming increase in threats to and deliberate targeting of aid workers, the Assembly adopted without a vote the draft resolution “Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel” (document A/72/L.22).  By its terms, the Assembly urged States to make every effort to ensure the full implementation of the rules of international law that protect aid workers.

Also by the text’s terms, the Assembly called upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies in countries in which humanitarian personnel were operating to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to allow those personnel to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population, including refugees and internally displaced persons.  It also called upon all States to consider becoming parties to relevant international instruments.

Prior to taking action on “L.22” as a whole, the Assembly, by a recorded vote of 95 in favour to 12 against, with 17 abstentions, decided to retain two paragraphs referencing the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  Several speakers, including the representative of the Netherlands, speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that language related to the Court was worthy of inclusion.

Meanwhile, Sudan’s representative, whose delegation had requested the vote, warned against politicizing humanitarian efforts.  Stressing that the International Criminal Court was not a United Nations organ, he reiterated that it was instead “at best a threat to the peace and stability” in his country.

Also under the humanitarian assistance umbrella, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, three draft resolutions on:  international cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development; strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations; and assistance to the Palestinian people, which had been introduced on 8 December.  (See Press Release GA/11990 of 8 December).

Sharing the perspective of those providing aid, a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), highlighted two worrying gaps in the United Nations indivisible new policy on prevention, development and peace.  The first was protection, as the policy focus rested on development and peace with recognition that protection was essential to both.  If people were being attacked, forcibly displaced, looted, impoverished, besieged, unlawfully detained or were too afraid to go to hospitals and schools, they would not attain development or peace.  The second gap was neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian action.  States must respect that essential practice — rooted in the Geneva Conventions — so that vulnerable people, both under or beyond the State’s control, could be protected and assisted impartially on the basis of need.

Raising another concern, a representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said risks driven by climate change would be unevenly weighted against poorer people living in areas of low development.  As such, she encouraged all stakeholders to ensure real progress by recognizing the added value of local actors in addressing and reducing disaster risks and impacts of climate change.

Turning to its agenda item on the culture of peace, the Assembly adopted the draft resolution “Promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace” (document A/72/L.29), reaffirming that interreligious and intercultural dialogue constituted important dimensions of the dialogue among civilizations.  It also condemned any advocacy of religious hatred that constituted incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence and underlined the importance of moderation as a value within societies for countering violent extremism and for further contributing to the promotion of interreligious dialogue, tolerance and cooperation.

By the terms of the draft resolution “Follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace” (document A/72/L.30), adopted without a vote, the Assembly urged the appropriate authorities to provide age-appropriate education in children’s schools, including lessons in mutual understanding, tolerance, active and global citizenship and human rights.  It also underlined that early childhood development contributes to the development of more peaceful societies through advancing equality, tolerance, human development and promoting human rights.

The Assembly, by the draft’s terms, called for investment in early childhood education, including through effective policies and practices.  It also invited Member States to continue to emphasize and expand their activities promoting a culture of peace and to ensure that peace and non-violence were fostered at all levels.

Considering the Report of the Credentials Committee (document A/72/601), the Assembly adopted without a vote a resolution, contained therein, on the credentials of representatives to the seventy-second session of the General Assembly.

In other business, the Assembly also elected the following 17 members to the Committee for Programme and Coordination for a three‑year term beginning on 1 January 2018:  Belarus, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chile, Cuba, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, United Kingdom, and United States.  It postponed to a date to be announced the appointment of members to the Committee on Conferences.

Also speaking today were the representatives of Canada (also for Australia, Liechtenstein, New Zealand and Norway) Russian Federation, Ireland, Iran, Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh, Armenia, United States, Brazil, El Salvador, as well as the State of Palestine and the Holy See.

Speaking in exercise of the right of reply was the representative of Azerbaijan.

The Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 12 December, to consider global health and foreign policy.

**Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Assistance**

ABDULLAH ABU SHAWESH, observer for the State of Palestine, said everyone must work together to ensure “no one gets left behind” in the quest for sustainable development.  All United Nations aid to the Palestinian people was strictly for relief and reconstruction.  “We cannot use these funds for true development,” he said, emphasizing that the Israeli occupation must be rejected so Palestinians could attempt to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Describing a five‑year Palestinian strategy focused on the adaptation and monitoring of development goals, he said all such progress, however, was being jeopardized by the Israeli occupation.  Despite grave scarcity of resources and problems caused by the occupation, Palestinian determination remained unshakeable.  “We are capable of overcoming all difficulties,” he said, noting all the sacrifices the Palestinian people had made to date.

PHILIP SPOERRI, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said there were two worrying gaps in the United Nations indivisible new policy on prevention, development and peace.  The first was protection, as the policy focus rested on development and peace with recognition that protection was essential to both.  If people were being attacked, forcibly displaced, looted, impoverished, besieged, unlawfully detained or were too afraid to go to hospitals and schools, they would not attain development or peace.  Inadequate detention policies also posed a risk to development and peace because inhumane detention practices could increase political grievances.  The second gap was neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian action.  States must respect that essential practice — rooted in the Geneva Conventions — so that vulnerable people, both under or beyond the State’s control, could be protected and assisted impartially on the basis of need.

ANNE CHRISTENSEN, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said risks driven by climate change would be unevenly weighted against poorer people living in areas of low development.  Those included individuals crowded in urban slums without access to reliable water and electricity sources as well as displaced persons in disaster‑prone and climate‑exposed areas.  Addressing such risks would require increased investment in local action and strong effort to ensure assistance reached those suffering the most.  Ways must be found of linking science to policy, decision‑making and action on the ground — for example, addressing climate extremes through early warning systems that reached the most vulnerable communities and enabled them to act.  Her organization had been working on quick and early action by communities and local authorities through an innovative method of advance financing based on weather forecasts.  She encouraged all stakeholders to ensure real progress by recognizing the added value of local actors in addressing and reducing disaster risks and impacts of climate change.

Prior to taking action on the draft resolution “Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel” (document A/72/L.22), representatives explained their delegations’ positions.

The representative of Canada, also speaking on behalf of Australia, Liechtenstein, New Zealand and Norway, regretted to note that a separate recorded vote had been called on several paragraphs of “L.22”, which sought to remove text that had been agreed upon for years.  Recent attacks on humanitarian and medical personnel in recent years only amplified the text’s relevance, she said.  Preambular paragraph 28 underscored the role the International Criminal Court could play and operative paragraph 7 called on all States to consider becoming party to the Court, she said, calling on all to vote to retain those paragraphs.

The representative of the Russian Federation said the seventy‑second session marked the second year that delegations were calling for others to review language in certain paragraphs because the draft resolution could no longer be considered consensual.  With the establishment of the International Criminal Court, the international community was expecting concrete actions to deal with impunity, settle existing conflicts and prevent new flashpoints of tension.  Yet many years into the Court’s existence, those expectations remained.  The alternative wording that had been proposed to the paragraphs in question deserved support because they considered salient issues.  Moreover, the proposed amendments should be supported because if adopted, they would return “L.22” to its consensual nature.

The representative of the Netherlands, speaking on behalf of the European Union, expressed regret that Sudan had called for a vote on preambular and operative paragraphs in “L.22”.  The International Criminal Court was a tool to fight impunity and contribute to international peace.  Its role was to complement rather than replace existing national judicial systems, he said, also stressing that perpetrators of crimes against humanity must always be held accountable.  The fight against impunity for the most serious crimes was critical in ensuring a fair and just society.  Peace and justice were complementary and not mutually exclusive, he said, expressing support for the paragraphs in question.

The representative of Sudan expressed serious reservations regarding the inclusion of references to the International Criminal Court in “L.22”.  The Court was not an organ of the United Nations, despite some parties painting it as such.  The principle of free consent meant that only those who were party to an agreement were bound by it.  Since 2003, the Court had been an impediment to peace in Darfur, creating a wedge between peace and justice, and was “at best a threat to the peace and stability in my country”, he said, adding that the Court was also fraught with corruption and scandals and lacked independence, as half of its budget was drawn from voluntary contributions from States and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who exercised control over it.  Noting the rejection of his delegation’s proposal to replace language in preambular paragraph 28 and operative paragraph 7, he emphasized that lofty goals of humanitarian assistance must not be mixed with a political agenda.

The Assembly then decided, by a recorded vote of 95 in favour to 12 against, with 17 abstentions, to retain preambular paragraph 28 and operative paragraph 7 of “L.22”.  Acting without a vote, it adopted “L.22” as a whole.

In a point of order, the representative of Israel referenced an Assembly resolution that had been adopted in 1998 on the participation of Palestine in the work of the United Nations.  The subject matter of today’s resolution did not fall under the rules of co-sponsorship, which were clearly indicated in the rules governing the United Nations.  Any decision to disregard those rules violated United Nations resolutions and undermined the Organization’s work.

The Assembly then adopted without a vote the draft resolution “International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development” (document A/72/L.23).

The representative of Israel said Palestine’s participation as a co-sponsor did not fall under the rules of co-sponsorship.  Any decision to disregard those rules undermined the United Nations work.

The Assembly adopted without a vote the draft resolution “International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development” (document A/72/L.24).

Also without a vote, it adopted the draft resolution “Assistance to the Palestinian people” (document A/72/L.25).

An observer for the Holy See reiterated his delegation’s reservations, including the belief that abortion was not a dimension of the terms “sexual and reproductive health” and “health-care services”.  With reference to gender, that concept was not to be interpreted as a social construction.

**Credentials Committee**

GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland), Chair of the Credentials Committee, introduced the “Report of the Credentials Committee” (document A/72/601), containing a draft resolution on the credentials of the representatives of Member States to the seventy-second session of the General Assembly.  The Committee had approved that draft resolution, which would have the Assembly accept the credentials of representatives of a number of Member States.

The representative of Iran, explaining his delegation’s position, said he supported a consensus decision, but expressed reservations to parts of the report that could constitute the recognition of the Israeli regime.

The representative of Indonesia drew attention to the “unfriendly” action of Vanuatu in including on their list of delegations a non-citizen of Vanuatu who had acted in a separatist movement of West Papua.  That person had spread malicious rumours and should not be granted credentials.  Indonesia objected to that act and rejected whatever message it had intended to convey.  It violated norms of multilateral conduct and the rights of Member States, he said, adding that the accreditation of Vanuatu, with knowledge that those individuals had such a mindset, was an act of hostility against Indonesia.  Member States should not play into the hands of separatists.  As such, Indonesia requested an explanation from Vanuatu concerning their delegation.

The Assembly then adopted the draft resolution without a vote.

**Culture of Peace**

TEODORO LOPEZ LOCSIN, JR. (Philippines), introducing the draft resolution “Promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace” (document A/72/L.29), said the text aimed to strengthen mechanisms and take action to promote sincere and constructive dialogue across cultural and religious divides.  The world was facing seemingly intractable conflicts and complex challenges that not only caused immense human suffering and economic loss, but also hindered socioeconomic cooperation and the pursuit of inclusive societies.  Suspicion and ignorance among various religions and civilizations were being exploited by extremist and terrorist groups to propagate their agendas.  It was essential to build on shared values and aspirations by strengthening mechanisms and actions through constructive dialogue, better understanding, moderation and promoting a global culture of peace.  He also pointed out several oral revisions to the text.

MASUD BIN MOMEN (Bangladesh), introducing the draft resolution “Follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace” (document A/72/L.30), said that the current version of the text contained four new elements.  It acknowledged the high-level event on Culture of Peace and its focus on early childhood development and recalled that General Assembly resolution 70/272 on the review of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture had introduced the notion of “sustaining peace”.  In addition, “L.30” noted the establishment of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and recognized the role of the work of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations in promoting a culture of people.  The draft also reiterated the request to consider convening in September 2018 a high-level forum devoted to the implementation of the Programme of Action.

The Assembly then adopted without a vote “L.29” as orally revised.

Also without a vote, it adopted “L.30”.

The representative of Armenia, explaining his delegation’s position, said objections to some paragraphs in “L.29” were based on the fact that Azerbaijan had abused international fora.  Preambular paragraph 23 concerned an event named World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue, which was a glaring example of manipulation against Armenia.  Due regard should be given to Azerbaijan’s destruction of heritage, as in the case of the obliteration of a medieval cemetery.  As such, Armenia disassociated itself from that paragraph.

The representative of the United States said his country was committed to a culture of peace through rejecting violence and promoting human rights, including by supporting efforts to enhance interreligious dialogue.  However, each country had its own development priorities.  The word “moderation” remained undefined in international law, he noted, adding that programmes and policies must respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The representative of Canada said operative paragraph 10 in “L.29” noted that interventions countering violent extremism were context-specific.  Respect for human rights, diversity and inclusion were needed to help communities to become more resilient.  Intercultural and interreligious dialogue was needed to create mutual respect and understanding.  It was a difficult balance, but Canada was committed to working with partners to preserve it.

The representative of Brazil said his delegation endorsed the twin resolutions on the peacebuilding architecture, yet cautioned that while supporting both the culture of peace and sustaining peace concepts, those actions should run on parallel tracks to avoid conflating mandates and concepts.  The General Assembly could do more on the human rights and development elements of the culture of peace.

The representative of El Salvador said constructing a culture of peace required institutions to be strengthened, noting that “L.30” underscored the importance of development in early childhood.  It was crucial to ensure children completed their early education and for curricula to include the culture of peace.  El Salvador was a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, he said, adding that his country had experienced a transition and was now working on supporting the United Nations to facilitate a new national agreement.  It was important to create strong institutions, he said, calling on all Member States to support the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in implementing a culture of peace in connection with the Sustainable Development Goals.  He also appealed to the General Assembly President to convene a high-level forum on the implementation of the Programme of Action.  Peace could not be considered in a reductive fashion as just the absence of war; peace was an endeavour that the international community must produce together.

**Right of Reply**

The representative of Azerbaijan, speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said multiculturalism was a long-standing tradition in his country.  “L.29” welcomed the Declaration and referred to the World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue and other fora.  Yet, there was nothing surprising in Armenia’s attempts to politicize resolutions.  By obstructing efforts and challenging global initiatives because of its relation to Azerbaijan, Armenia had demonstrated that its good faith was elusive.  Regarding human rights and international humanitarian law, he said Azerbaijan had preserved its diversity to the present day.

**Programme and Coordination Committee Elections**

The Assembly then turned to the election to the Committee for Programme and Coordination the following members, nominated by the Economic and Social Council, for a three-year term beginning on 1 January 2018:  Belarus, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chile, Cuba, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, United Kingdom and United States.

The Economic and Social Council had nominated Botswana, Burkina Faso and Cameroon for the three of the four seats among African States; India, Iran, Japan and Pakistan for the four seats among Asia-Pacific States; Belarus, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova for the three seats among Eastern European States; Brazil, Chile and Cuba for three of the four seats among the Latin American and Caribbean States; and Germany, Portugal, United Kingdom and United States for four of the five seats among the Western European and other States.

The following States were eligible for immediate re-election, after 1 January 2018:  Argentina, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Eritrea, France, Haiti, Peru, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Senegal, United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

The Economic and Social Council had postponed the nomination of one member from each of the following groups:  African States, Latin American and Caribbean States and Western European and other States for election for three-year terms beginning on 1 January 2018.  Members were also reminded of the remaining two vacancies among the Western European and other States, for terms beginning on the date of election and expiring on 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018, respectively.

As one seat from Asia-Pacific States for a term beginning on the date of appointment and ending on 31 December 2019 remained vacant, the General Assembly President appointed China to fill that vacancy.  The General Assembly would take action to fill remaining vacancies upon the receipt of nominations by the Economic and Social Council.

The Assembly then postponed to a later date the appointment of members of the Committee on Conferences.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY    
PLENARY    
SEVENTY-SECOND SESSION, 69TH MEETING (PM)

More people than ever before, displaced by conflict and natural hazards, required aid and relief from the international community, the General Assembly heard today as speakers stressed the need to strengthen coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United Nations.

“The great privilege of having a voice in these hallowed halls comes with a huge responsibility to our people,” said General Assembly President Miroslav Lajčák (Slovakia).

In a statement delivered by Assembly Vice-President Zina Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar), Mr. Lajčák said that 65 million people in 2017 had been forcibly displaced, more than ever before, while 377 million in 2016 had been affected by natural hazards.

He said using people as pawns for narrow political victories was to deny a common humanity.  Preventing and resolving conflict was a first line of defence against conflict‑induced crises.  Vulnerability and poverty were also root causes of immense human suffering.  All parties must allow humanitarian access and the targeting of humanitarian and medical personnel must be condemned.  Protection must also be extended to those who experienced gender‑based and sexual violence.

Postponing action until Monday, the Assembly heard introductions of the following four draft resolutions under its cluster on humanitarian and disaster relief assistance:  “Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel” (document A/72/L.22), “International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development” (document A/72/L.23), “International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development” (document A/72/L.24) and “Assistance to the Palestinian people” (document A/72/L.25).

By the terms of draft text, “Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel”, the Assembly would urge all States to make every effort to ensure the full and effective implementation of the relevant rules of international law.  It would also condemn the targeting of humanitarian personnel and call upon all States to consider becoming parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

By the terms of draft resolution “International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development”, the Assembly would express concern at the increasing impact of natural hazards.  Furthermore, it would reiterate the commitment to support the efforts of countries to strengthen their capacities to assess and reduce risks.  It would stress the importance of equal participation of women in implementing disaster risk reduction, preparedness, response and recovery strategies.

The Assembly, by terms of the text “Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations”, would call upon all States to continue to implement effective legislative to mitigate the effects of natural hazards, and to integrate disaster risk reduction strategies into development planning.  It would also stress the need to strengthen resilience, and in that regard, would encourage Member States and the United Nations system to integrate resilience into humanitarian and development programmes.

The Assembly, by terms of the draft text “Assistance to the Palestinian people”, would stress the importance of following up on the results of the Cairo International Conference on Palestine:  Reconstructing Gaza to effectively promote economic recovery and reconstruction in a timely manner.  It would also call on donors to transfer funds as soon as possible and urge Member States to open their markets to exports of Palestinian products on the most favourable terms.

In the ensuing discussion, Member States outlined myriad ways they were aiding and assisting millions in need.  The representative of the European Union said the bloc and its member States, collectively the world’s largest humanitarian donor, would continue to do their part.  Protecting civilians and aid workers was essential, he underscored, also adding that lessons must be learned from past crises.

Israel’s representative urged the international community to “never turn a blind eye” to those in need.  She stressed that her country would not let its call to action be diluted by politics, noting an Israeli hospital that had treated thousands of Syrians.

The representative of the United States said that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and similar agreements remained non‑binding, underscoring that each country had its own development priorities.

“People’s lives must not become pawns in geopolitical games,” stressed the representative of the Russian Federation, noting that linking assistance with domestic political processes was unacceptable.

The rising risk of natural hazards was underscored as a major threat by some countries, with the representative of Maldives stressing that, on small islands, there were normally limited points of entry, which might face structural damage, obstructing access to humanitarian aid.  It could be beneficial to establish pre‑existing systems that could immediately mobilize aid with the cooperation of Member States in close geographical proximity.

El Salvador’s representative, speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), emphasized the growing impact of extreme hydro‑meteorological phenomena associated with climate change on the entire Central American region.  He called on the Assembly to recognize the impact of small‑scale and slow‑moving disasters.

Also before the Committee were the following reports of the Secretary-General: “Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel” (document [A/72/490](http://undocs.org/A/72/490)); “Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations” (document [A/72/76](http://undocs.org/A/72/76)); “International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development” (document [A/72/348](http://undocs.org/A/72/348)), “Central Emergency Response Fund” (document [A/72/358](http://undocs.org/A/72/358)); and Assistance to the Palestinian People (document [A/72/87](http://undocs.org/A/72/87)). 

Also speaking were the representatives of Brunei Darussalam, Qatar, Thailand, Spain, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, China, Canada, Kuwait, Turkey, Ukraine, Bangladesh and Syria.

Exercising the right of reply were the representatives of Myanmar, Israel and Syria.

The General Assembly will reconvene at 10 a.m., Monday, 11 December, to conclude its consideration of strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations and take up culture of peace.

Opening Remarks

Miroslav Lajčák (Slovakia), President of the General Assembly, said more people were on the move than ever before — some by choice, but many others to escape conflict, natural hazards and other situations.  Emphasizing that humanitarian and disaster relief was the business of every Member State, he said 65 million people in 2017 had been forcibly displaced, more than ever before, while 377 million in 2016 had been affected by natural hazards.  Stressing that the deadline for the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration was drawing closer, he warned that failure to conclude that instrument would be a blow to the United Nations and heap unspeaking suffering on human beings.

Member States must protect the suffering and those who were helping them, he said.  To use people as pawns for narrow political victories was to deny a common humanity.  “The great privilege of having a voice in these hallowed halls comes with a huge responsibility to our people,” he said.  Protection also extended to those who experienced gender‑based and sexual violence, which was on the rise.  All parties must allow humanitarian access and the targeting of humanitarian and medical personnel must be condemned, he said.

He went on to underscore the need to prevent and mitigate conflicts and natural hazards.  Preventing and resolving conflict was a first line of defence against conflict‑induced crises, he said, adding that vulnerability and poverty were also root causes of immense human suffering.  International humanitarian law and human rights law must be upheld, while disaster risk reduction strategies, including early warning systems, must be put in place.

Concluding, he asked the General Assembly to recommit to taking action in line with its plans and today’s resolutions.  It must also bear in mind also the United Nations Charter, the “master plan” that gave Member States the responsibility to save future generations from war, to maintaining international law and to promote better living standards for all.  While humanitarian action was saving lives, there remained a 43 per cent gap for humanitarian funding in 2016, he said, welcoming pledges made today at the Central Emergency Response Fund pledging conference and inviting the Assembly to continue that quest together.

Introduction of Draft Resolutions

MINNA-LIINA LIND (Estonia), speaking on behalf of the European Union, introduced draft resolutions A/72/L.22 and A/72/L.25, titled “Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel” and “Assistance to the Palestinian people”, respectively.  Presenting the first text, she said risks facing humanitarian workers were on the rise.  Humanitarian personnel were no longer spared, she added, emphasizing that the high purpose of their mission no longer protected them.  The trend was worrying and must be reversed “if we want the people on the ground to be able to deliver their noble responsibilities”.  Accountability was lagging, she said, adding that the international community had a collective responsibility to protect humanitarian personnel workers.  She stressed the importance of ensuring that the safety of such workers was included in the planning of security management systems.  Meanwhile, civil society must also be supported as it worked to provide humanitarian assistance.  The vulnerability of locally recruited personnel was also underlined in the text.

By the terms of that text, the Assembly would also urge all States to make every effort to ensure the full and effective implementation of the relevant principles and rules of international law, including international humanitarian law, international human rights law and refugee law, she said.  It would also condemn in the strongest possible terms the increase in threats to and deliberate targeting of humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel, acts of terrorism and attacks on humanitarian convoys.  It would call upon all States to consider becoming parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and stressed the obligation to respect and protect medical personnel.  Further, it would have the Assembly stress that the effective functioning at the country level of security operations required a unified and robust capacity for policy, standards, coordination, communication, compliance, threat and risk assessment, and operational and deployment flexibility.

Introducing second text, she said that an already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza had been worsening.  Alleviating human suffering there required the lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip.  She also noted the contributions of the European Union to the Palestinian cause.  While the resolution would need an update in the coming years, she said, it was nevertheless constructive and timely.

By terms of that draft, the Assembly would stress the importance of following up on the results of the Cairo International Conference on Palestine:  Reconstructing Gaza to effectively promote economic recovery and reconstruction in a timely and sustainable manner, she said.  It would also call on donors that have not yet converted their budget support pledges into disbursements to transfer funds as soon as possible and encourage them to increase their direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority.  It would also urge Member States to open their markets to exports of Palestinian products on the most favourable terms and to implement fully existing trade and cooperation agreements.  Furthermore, it would stress the need for the full implementation by both parties of existing agreements, including the Agreement on Movement and Access and the Agreed Principles for the Rafah Crossing, of 15 November 2005, to allow for the freedom of movement of the Palestinian civilian population, as well as for imports and exports, within and into and out of the Gaza Strip.

IRINA MORENO GONZÁLEZ (Ecuador) introduced the resolution titled “International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development” (document A/72/L.23), saying that it recognized that States had the primary responsibility to coordinate and deliver humanitarian assistance on their soil.  The text also encouraged Member States and the United Nations to empower local actors to respond to community challenges and work to reduce risk, need and vulnerability.  It also encouraged Member States to continue to collect, share and use critical data that informed policy.  She said the draft was negotiated in a constructive spirit and expressed hope that it would be adopted by consensus.

By the terms of that text, the Assembly would express its deep concern at the increasing impact of natural hazards, resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide, she said.  It would also urge the United Nations, relevant humanitarian and development organizations, international financial institutions and other relevant stakeholders to strengthen the capacity and resilience of Member States, including through the application of new science and technology.  Furthermore, it would reiterate the commitment to support the efforts of countries, in particular developing nations, to strengthen their capacities at all levels to assess and reduce risks.  It would also stress the importance of the full and equal participation of women in decision‑making and of gender mainstreaming in developing and implementing disaster risk reduction, preparedness, response and recovery strategies.

Statements

IRINA SCHOULGIN NYONI (Sweden), delivering a joint statement also on behalf of India, said that the partnership between the two countries was a reflection of their shared commitment to a strong international humanitarian response system.  The number of those in need of humanitarian assistance was at its highest level since the end of the Second World War.  The global humanitarian system reached tens of millions of people every year and saved millions of lives.  It was an effective and responsive system staffed by dedicated and professional individuals.

India and Sweden reaffirmed that humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law provided the basis for humanitarian assistance, she said.  She emphasized that the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of States must be fully respected during humanitarian action.  More humanitarian workers were being targeted in violent attacks than ever before, she said, condemning all such actions directed against those workers.  She also noted that India was among the first countries to make emergency aid available to those affected by hurricanes in the Caribbean and that Sweden was one of the single largest donors of core funding to United Nations humanitarian agencies.

Introducing a resolution titled “Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations” (document A/72/L.24), she said that the stakes have never been higher for millions around the world.  That was why the concept of consensus and of collaborative approach was so critical.  The resolution reaffirmed the unique leadership role of the United Nations in coordinating and responding to global humanitarian needs.  It also put additional focus on the alarming food security situation for millions of people.  Furthermore, it provided a stronger platform for humanitarian reform and humanitarian financing and reflected the interdependency and criticality of partnership between different aspects of humanitarian assistance.  The strengthened resolution was the result of the common dedication of Member States of countries providing aid and of those receiving it.

By the terms of that text, the Assembly would call upon all States to adopt, where required, and to continue to implement effective, necessary legislative and other appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of natural hazards, and to integrate disaster risk reduction strategies into development planning, she said.  It would also urge Member States, the United Nations system and other humanitarian actors to consider the specific and differentiated consequences of natural hazards in both rural and urban areas when designing and implementing disaster risk reduction, prevention and mitigation, preparedness, humanitarian assistance and early recovery strategies.  It would also stress the need to strengthen resilience at all levels, and in that regard, would encourage Member States and the United Nations system to integrate resilience into humanitarian and development programming.

SITI ARNYFARIZA MD JAINI (Brunei Darussalam), speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said some of her region’s disasters in 2017 had been due to extreme weather events.  She added that Southeast Asia as a region was disaster‑prone and vulnerable to climate change.  To build disaster‑resilient nations, the group’s member States were working to ensure implementation and coherence of intra‑ASEAN policy frameworks, including through creating a Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management.  That Centre had delivered relief items for affected communities in Rakhine State in Myanmar, northern Viet Nam and Marawi City in the Philippines.  ASEAN continued to invest in joint preparedness and disaster relief exercises.

Secondly, she said, ASEAN was strengthening collaborative partnerships through processes such as the East Asia Summit, among others, and was committed to enhancing cooperation with the United Nations in that field.  Exchanges of inter‑operability of briefs between ASEAN officials and the United Nations Under‑Secretary‑General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator showed progress in turning words into action.  ASEAN would continue to strengthen its coordination work to respond effectively to any future humanitarian and disaster relief needs.

JOÃO PEDRO VALE DE ALMEIDA, European Union, said that the tasks facing the humanitarian community had never been so daunting, with challenges both enormous in scope and very different than 26 years ago, when the Assembly adopted resolution 46/182.  According to the Global Humanitarian Overview, an estimated 136 million people would need humanitarian assistance in 2018 and $22.5 billion would be required to meet the needs of 90.1 million.  Many humanitarian crises had become so protracted as to be seen as permanent, while growth in needs had outpaced increases in funding, with an estimated funding gap of $12 billion.  More importantly, underlying causes had not gone away, he said.  Extreme weather events, environmental degradation and climate change consequences, amplified by conflicts, were causing unprecedented human suffering, death, food insecurity and the destruction of livelihoods, infrastructure and ecosystems.  Conflicts also remained the main drivers of humanitarian needs, he said, noting that all but two of the 2018 humanitarian response plans were for situations involving conflict.  Increasingly, conflicts were also a leading cause of hunger, while international humanitarian law was increasingly being disregarded.

The Union and its member States were committed to assuming their part of the international community’s shared responsibility to save lives, alleviate suffering and preserve human dignity, he said, noting that 2017 marked the tenth anniversary of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid.  Principled humanitarian action would remain at the core of the bloc’s response.  It would persevere in its efforts to ensure respect for international humanitarian law, refugee law and international human rights law, he said, emphasizing also the importance of accountability when serious violations of international human rights law occurred.  Protecting civilians and aid workers was more than ever a priority.  At the same time, there was no alternative to the more efficient delivery of humanitarian aid, he said, stressing that the Union would continue to support anticipatory humanitarian assistance.  Lessons must be learned from past crises, while the international community must work on political solutions to end conflicts.  Concluding, he said the bloc and its member States, collectively the world’s largest humanitarian donor, would continue to do their part in a principled manner.

Mr. HASSAN (Maldives) said the United Nations system must be structured so that it adequately catered to existing humanitarian situations as potential emerging ones.  Responses must be tailored to needs through strategic analysis of them in consultation with affected countries and communities.  Disaggregated data must be used for more informed responses, which must be constantly revaluated with the most recent information.  In the case of small island developing States, acquiring that data could be challenging due to inherent structural and resource constraints.  On small islands, there were normally limited points of entry, which might face structural damage, obstructing access to humanitarian aid.  Through strategic planning in disaster‑prone areas, it could be beneficial to establish pre‑existing systems that could immediately mobilize aid with the cooperation of Member States in close geographical proximity.

ANAT FISHER-TSIN (Israel) said that conflict, natural hazards and disease continued to impact the lives of millions worldwide.  Humanitarian crises were not bound by borders and could affect developed nations in all regions of the world.  It was the responsibility of the international community to act and “never turn a blind eye” to those in need.  Israel was committed to providing humanitarian assistance to those who need aid and relief.  The ongoing conflict in Syria left so many devastated.  Her country would not let its call to action be diluted by politics, she said, noting that an Israeli hospital had treated thousands of Syrian patients.  From Syria to Sierra Leone and from Mexico to Puerto Rico, Israel would never waver in its commitment to help others.  She noted how Israel had recently sent relief to victims of the earthquakes in Mexico.

Mr. AL-HAMMADI (Qatar) said that the growing number of crises and conflicts had brought great suffering.  The enormous number of people requiring humanitarian assistance had also burdened the United Nations.  Millions had been displaced by natural hazards, he added, also underscoring the economic and social disaster faced by the Palestinian people.  He said Qatar supported the Central Emergency Response Fund and noted that his country’s foreign affairs policy was based on constructively facing common challenges and peacefully settling conflicts.  Qatar had also strengthened its regional and international partnerships in the area of humanitarian response.  In financing humanitarian assistance, Qatar had offered millions in funding to Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

KANJANATORN KANJANASOON, aligning himself with ASEAN’s statement, said humanitarian crises continued to be the most urgent challenge facing the world today and pointed to the scale of human suffering inflicted by war, natural disasters and poverty as larger than ever before.  Countries had taken steps to combat growing humanitarian crises, but it was perhaps time to dive into serious conversations on establishing long‑term solutions to those crises through better risk assessment and preparedness.  The most vulnerable areas must have adequate prevention measures and resilient infrastructures.  In cases of humanitarian crises resulting from war and political turmoil, the end goal was not only to find political solutions to country‑specific conflicts, but to protect and save human lives.  Humanitarian operations should be carried out with humanity and impartiality, while fostering trust and cooperation with relevant Governments.

ROMÁN OYARZUN MARCHESI (Spain), associating himself with the European Union, said the news for the coming year was not good, with 133 million people expected to require humanitarian assistance, an increase of 4 per cent from this year.  Mechanisms at the United Nations for prevention and humanitarian assistance were not working as they should despite the efforts of Member States.  He emphasized the connection between conflicts and serious violations of humanitarian law, as well as the high degree of impunity in armed conflicts, insufficient implementation of Security Council resolutions, and forgotten protracted conflicts.  He went on to underscore the impact of climate change in relation to natural disasters, saying that the Security Council should consider that issue.

WON DOYEON (Republic of Korea) said that the international community had provided record levels of humanitarian funding to cope with unprecedented humanitarian crises.  Consolidating its fight against famine in four regions, the pre‑emptive actions of the United Nations had saved the lives of many people who could have become victims of famine.  Highlighting the linkages between environmental degradation, underdevelopment, inequality and violent extremism, he called for greater coordination and collaboration among the United Nations and its partners.  At the same time, he noted that improving the overall efficiency of the humanitarian system could make a real difference.  For example, the “New Way of Working” programme had provided important guidance to Member States and agencies to help make the whole ecosystem robust.  Calling for humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable people, he expressed concern about the increased risk of gender‑based violence in crises against women and girls.

OLIVIER MARC ZEHNDER (Switzerland) said humanitarian needs continued to grow with each passing year.  Both civilians and humanitarian workers continued to be targeted, which required a strong united response from the international community.  He reiterated that humanitarian assistance must be provided in accordance with the principles of neutrality and impartiality.  Access to people in need must be ensured.  The protection of those who risk their lives to care for the sick and wounded must be strengthened.  The phenomenon of forced displacement caused by natural hazards, climate change or armed conflict required close coordination between various humanitarian and development instruments, as well as peace‑building and human rights instruments.  Given the immense humanitarian challenges, progress made in 2017 had been an encouraging sign.  Nevertheless, the text being adopted today still fell short of the requirements of the global humanitarian situation, especially in terms of aid access and complementarity of humanitarian and development approaches.

LUO JIN (China) said the international community should promote development and maintain peace to reduce the demand for humanitarian relief.  Recent years had witnessed numerous humanitarian crises caused by armed conflicts, where poverty was an important root cause of the turmoil.  The global community must also strengthen capacity‑building in developing countries to enable them to effectively cope with natural disasters.  Over the past year, natural disasters like hurricanes, droughts, floods and earthquakes had caused enormous property losses and human casualties, with climate change further exacerbating the adverse effects.  The international community must increase financial and technical assistance to affected countries, based on their national conditions and specific needs, to enhance their capacity for risk management.  It should also help those countries with infrastructure building to provide a solid basis for the transition from disaster relief to development.

LOUISE BLAIS (Canada) said the international community had faced a challenging year again, with millions of people forced into protracted displacement by conflict, famine and food insecurity, which had reached historic levels and resulted in escalating levels of humanitarian needs.  The humanitarian community must address the root causes of conflict, including by addressing the needs of women and girls.  Canada, for its part, had launched an action plan to support women’s and girls’ access to sexual and reproductive health services in emergency and conflict settings, among other initiatives.  The international community must make efforts to allow greater humanitarian access, she said, adding that bureaucratic restrictions and attacks on humanitarian workers meant denial of life‑saving assistance.  Member States could better address the needs of persons in conflict by upholding their international obligations to respect international humanitarian law.

Ms. ALFASSAM (Kuwait), noting that her country provided foreign assistance through a programme known as “Humanitarian Diplomacy”, said the world was witnessing increasing disasters and conflicts.  That required collective action, she stressed, adding that humanitarian ties must be strengthened and obstacles to aid removed.  Kuwait had adhered to the Arab Cooperation Convention on facilitating relief operations, which among other things exempted relief supplies from customs or fees, organized and streamlined relief responses and provided for licenses to necessary personnel.  She expressed hope that parties would join together to provide efficient humanitarian responses to the world’s various challenges.

Ms. BLAKE (United States), noting that an estimated $22.5 billion would be required in 2018 to provide humanitarian assistance to just 91 million of those in need, said conflicts and protracted violence would likely continue to push people from their homes and deprive them of food.  Today’s text on humanitarian assistance highlighted how the United Nations and other organizations could better address such needs.  The text on the safety of humanitarian personnel sent an important message, as there had recently been far too many deaths of such personnel.  On the resolution regarding the coordination of the United Nations emergency humanitarian assistance, she welcomed the inclusion of language on needs assessments.  Measures to address fraud and abuse were also important.

Outlining several clarifications regarding her delegation’s position, she said the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and similar agreements remained non‑binding.  Each country had its own development priorities.  Recalling that the United States had communicated its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement pending the negotiation of different terms, she said that while such policies remained under review her country must express its reservation to all references to the Agreement in today’s texts.  Previous explanations of her delegation’s position on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and other such agreements remained valid, she said, adding that further Assembly resolutions did not alter existing international law.  Noting that any reaffirmation of prior documents applied only to those States that had agreed to them initially, she underscored that conflict and access constraints — rather than volatile commodity prices — were the drivers of humanitarian crises, and that the United States did not recognize the right to abortion or include abortion in any of its humanitarian assistance policies.

RUBÉN ARMANDO ESCALANTE HASBÚN (El Salvador), speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), emphasized the growing impact of extreme hydro‑meteorological phenomena associated with climate change and El Niño on his country and the entire Central American region, triggering humanitarian emergencies, displacement, food insecurity and displacement.  In that regard, he invited the General Assembly to keep an eye on that issue and to increasingly recognize the impact of small‑scale and slow‑moving disasters.  El Salvador supported efforts in Geneva towards a mechanism that would more specifically safeguard respect for international humanitarian law, he said, adding that solid implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development would help prevent or reduce the impact of humanitarian crises.

FERIDUN HADI SINIRLIOĞLU (Turkey) said that with 136 million people in need of assistance and protection in crises, the gap between the humanitarian needs and the resources available to address those needs had continued to widen.  It was hard to sit idle in the face of crises in Syria, Myanmar, South Sudan and Yemen.  Turkey, for its part, was sheltering close to 3.3 million Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans who had fled violence; Turkish humanitarians of national agencies were working to assist them as well as those in need in Somalia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Iraq.  In Istanbul at the World Humanitarian Summit, Turkey had announced its support for the commitments in five core responsibilities, including the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants.  As humanitarian needs mounted, now was the moment for all stakeholders to, among other goals, address the need for fair burden-sharing.

YURIY VITRENKO (Ukraine) said today’s resolution was especially important for his country, given the dire humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine that was a direct consequence of ongoing Russian aggression.  Citing United Nations figures, he said 3.4 million people needed humanitarian assistance and protection.  After nearly four years of conflict, 1.5 million Ukrainians were registered as internally displaced.  Continuation of the Russian aggression could also lead to an ecological and humanitarian catastrophe.  A cessation of hostilities remained essential to enable an effective humanitarian response as well as the protection of civilians and humanitarian personnel, he said, adding that the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission would allow an improvement in the humanitarian situation.  He went on to express his country’s full support for the Secretary‑General’s reform efforts, particularly in humanitarian assistance.

MASUD BIN MOMEN (Bangladesh) drew attention to the influx into Bangladesh of nearly 630,000 mostly Rohingya people from Myanmar’s Rakhine state, saying they were entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance.  He urged donor countries and organizations to respond to that catastrophe in a spirit of responsibility and burden‑sharing.  While his Government was engaging with the Myanmar authorities to facilitate the return of those displaced, it was incumbent on the international community to work with Myanmar to create an environment for the safe, dignified and voluntary return of Rohingya to their homes without fear of reprisals or discrimination, he said.  It was also imperative that those committing horrific crimes against Rohingya were identified and brought to justice.  He went on to underscore the great importance his country attached to United Nations humanitarian and emergency relief assistance, and its support for international efforts to build resilient societies and nations.

AMMAR AWAD (Syria) said each year the Assembly met to agree to provide humanitarian assistance to all those in need without discrimination or politicization.  Stressing that such assistance must be provided in strict accordance the United Nations principles, including respect for State sovereignty — as well as the roles of nations in overseeing the distribution and provision of aid in their territories — he expressed regret that the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the States presenting some of the texts before the Assembly today were in engaging in such politicization.  The only solution to any humanitarian crisis was to address its root cause without selectivity.  Regarding the fight against terrorism, he welcomed the text’s reference to “terrorist acts” as a true step forward, noting that the co-sponsors had finally admitted that poverty and disasters were not the only causes of displacement — terrorism was another.

Noting that the resolution on the safety and security of humanitarian personnel could have benefitted from a clearer condemnation of terrorist attacks, he said such attacks were the main cause of suffering among the Syrian people.  Combating that phenomenon required cooperation and coordination with the Government of Syria, he said, reiterating his call to apply pressure on States to end the financing and arming of terrorist groups.  In addition, he said, the texts failed to mention the negative effects of unilateral coercive economic measures, which had serious impacts on the well-being and economies of many countries.  It was strange that today’s draft resolutions referred to the 2030 Agenda, but did not mention the unilateral coercive measures whose impacts could prevent its implementation.  Responding to the statement delivered by the representative of Israel — an occupying Power — he said the latter’s accusations against Syria were aimed to hide Israel’s own crimes against both Syrians and Palestinians.  Among the root causes of the crisis in Syria was the longstanding Israeli occupation, as well as that regime’s support to Nusrah Front, Da’esh and other terrorist groups.

SERGEY B. KONONOUCHENKO (Russian Federation), echoing calls for enhanced cooperation to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need, said his country had more than $65 million in 2017 including more than $1.5 million allocated specifically to the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund.  Expressing support for calls to increase the Fund’s capitalization to $1 billion, he called on all humanitarian actors to act in a neutral and impartial manner and to respect State sovereignty.  “People’s lives must not become pawns in geopolitical games,” he stressed, noting that linking assistance with domestic political processes was equally unacceptable.  Warning against the double standards that were increasingly emerging in the unbalanced funding of humanitarian operations, he added that the overwhelming majority of Member States — including his own — had not supported the outcomes of the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit and were unwilling to include them in United Nations activities.  He also expressed regret that the representative of Ukraine had made today made several politicized statements and remained unwilling to accept the fact that Kyiv had created the bloody conflict in the east of that country.

Right of Reply

The representative of Myanmar, speaking in exercise of the right of reply, responded to the statement by Bangladesh, saying his Government took heed of the international community’s concerns regarding the situation in Rakhine State.  The Government was deploying all means and resources to address the humanitarian situation, he said, adding that issues between neighbouring States should be resolved amicably through bilateral contacts.

The representative of Israel, responding to her counterpart from Syria, said the truth should not be expected from the representative of a State that was committing war crimes against its own people.  She noted that her country was providing medical treatment to Syrian women, children and the elderly.

The representative of Syria, in response, said Israel was an official declared partner of Nusrah Front, Da’esh and others, providing them with weapons and other assistance, and on 4 December, committing aggression against Damascus in coordination with terrorist partners.  He added that the occupying authorities had continued to carry out acts of aggression against Syria in violation of Security Council resolutions, preventing his country from advancing to fight terrorist groups.

• More than 45 people were reportedly killed, including six aid workers, in an attack by armed men in Duk County, Jonglei.

• Continued reports of armed clashes in multiple locations of the country in the past weeks, affecting thousands of people.

• Women and girls are experiencing unprecedented levels of violence in South Sudan’s conflict.

• The humanitarian response in the Greater Baggari area, Wau County continues, despite challenges.

• South Sudan’s conflict has left a large number of people with disabilities.

**Six aid workers killed in Jonglei’s Duk County**

More than 45 people were reportedly killed, including six aid workers working with two NGOs, during an attack by armed men in Duk Payuel village, Duk County (Jonglei). Reports indicate that another 19 people were injured, including three aid workers. During the attack, houses were burned, and civilian properties looted and destroyed. Nearly 2.4 metric tons of humanitarian food items were looted and a warehouse was vandalized. There are reports of thousands of civilians displaced to the neighbouring village of Poktap. About 55 children and women were reportedly abducted by the attackers and more than 1,300 cattle raided. The attack also displaced over 2,000 people from Duk Payuel to Poktap, according to findings of a rapid assessment mission. 

An NGO has temporarily suspended food security and livelihoods activities in the area to reassess the security situation before they resume operations. The only hospital in the area has also been closed due to the severe impact of the attack on the health workers in the facility. Partners undertook an inter-agency mission on Monday 4 December to assess the situation in Duk Payuel and Poktap, to determine how best to respond to the immediate needs of the affected people. 

The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudéhou, strongly condemned the attack in a press statement. “It is outrageous that civilians and humanitarians providing assistance continue to be targeted,” said Mr. Noudéhou. “I call on all armed elements to respect civilians and aid workers, wherever they are in the country.”",4602,"Safety and Security"

2393439,"Venezuela Situation Update, November 2017 The total number of Venezuelans in Colombia has more than doubled in less than four months, reaching 660,000 individuals, end-November, up from 300,000 in June.

Between January and October 2017 over 100.000 Venezuelan nationals have entered Peru through the northern entry point in Tumbes, according to authorities.

In Brazil 15,645 Venezuelans have lodged asylum claims in 2017, 1,680 Temporary Residence Permits have been granted and a total of 30,000 are estimated to live in the country.

**POPULATION OF CONCERN** 

- In November the movements from Venezuela to Colombia continued to grow, according to government figures that show net arrivals from Venezuelans reached 4,000 people per day (up from 3,500 in October), and 2,500 Colombian returnees per day. Colombian authorities also reported that some 200,000 have crossed into Ecuador. 

- Over 1 million Venezuelans have now registered for the Border Mobility Card (TMF) in Colombia. 

- In Peru 19,000 Venezuelans have applied for the Temporary Permanence Permit (PTP), Peruvian authorities estimate. Since August 4,000 PTPs have been issued out of that total. 

- At least 60,000 Venezuelans are estimated to be residing in the Southern Caribbean. 

- In Brazil some 15,000 of all Venezuelan asylum-claims have been lodged in Roraima border state since 2014, 2,500 in Amazonas state and some 590 in Sao Paulo.

**CONTEXT INFORMATION**

Over one million Venezuelans have left their country, according to host Government figures. Over 106,000 have sought asylum since 2014, more than half in 2017. Some 190,000 have also applied for alternative legal status across the region. They claim they are leaving for a variety of reasons, including threats by armed groups; fear of being targeted on account of their political opinion, real or perceived; insecurity and violence; lack of food, medicine and access to essential social services, as well as loss of income.

UNHCR has also identified hundreds of indigenous people crossing the borders, primarily into Colombia and Brazil. These groups sometimes travel long distances by land and have shown to be highly vulnerable as they do not have the financial resources to buy food or shelter. Additional support has been provided to them.

While the dialogue between the Government and the opposition coalition has restarted in the Dominican Republic, people continue to steadily leave the country. The socio-economic situation increasingly deteriorates and inflation has made it extremely difficult to access food, medicine, basic products and services. Reports from international organizations state that there is a considerable number of people with chronic malnutrition in the country, as well as a shortage of medicine. As a result of the strained resources, insecurity has also been increasing and having a rising impact on peoples’ lives.

**Operational Context**

**Brazil**

- The Government of Roraima has declared a state of social emergency due to the “intense, unlimited and disorderly flow of Venezuelans without means or conditions to sustain themselves” that arrive from Venezuela. Local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to provide an adequate security and health response, as well as to implement the recent government resolution that establishes standard operation procedures for the protection of unaccompanied and separated children, based on the recommendations by UNHCR.

- Among the reasons given by the Warao for leaving Venezuela, is that the government’s support to indigenous communities in the country has ceased. They claim that there are no available schools, health centres or services. Water distribution, usually their only source of potable water, has allegedly also stopped. The Warao also stated that they suffered discrimination in the access to ID- documents, which could help explain the considerable amount of Warao without identification arriving in Brazil.

- The Warao continue to move inward, confirming their intent to stay. Over 200 Warao are living in Pará state. The majority is living on the streets, while some 70 people are staying in a rural school set up as a temporary shelter by the Municipality. Following UNHCR’s counsel, Amazonas and Pará authorities created a formal communication channel to exchange experiences and lessons learned.

**Colombia**

- Armed groups activities at the Colombian-Venezuela border, incursions by the Venezuelan military into Colombia, confrontations between governments and the lack of capacity to control the actions of armed actors on both sides of the border are increasing risks for persons of concern in these areas. UNHCR continues to monitor the reports of violence at the border.

- In October, a pamphlet was distributed in Arauca by the “Araucan Social Cleansing Group”, accusing Venezuelan men of selling drugs to children and committing crimes and Venezuelan women of being prostitutes, and called for them to go back to Venezuela or face assassination.

- Colombian authorities are concerned about the spread of diseases including malaria, measles, diphtheria and tuberculosis in reception areas. They state that due to a lack of health access in Venezuela, arrivals are boosting transmission rates. More than 19,000 Venezuelans have received emergency treatment in Colombia, increasing pressure on local services. The Government is working with the Red Cross and WHO/PAHO to increase services, and UNHCR is advocating to ensure a protection-sensitive approach.

- The Special Stay Permit (PEP) application deadline expired on 31 October. Over 67,000 Venezuelans applied for the permit, which allows them to regularize their status, work and access basic services for up to two years in Colombia. UNHCR is advocating for this measure to be extended to ensure that legal pathways remain open, as is the case in other countries in the region.",4603,"Shelter and Non-Food Items"

PRC Chairman Richard Gordon made the appeal as figures on the number of deaths and missing people from the flashfloods and landslides that struck parts of Mindanao continue to rise in the wake of ‘Vinta’.

“Rural communities, which are in remote mountainous areas, are the hardest hit. Some villages are swept away by surging current of mud and water. We’re really in our toes right now. We’re trying to figure out how to bring our help closer to our people who are suffering right now” Gordon said. 

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) on Monday reported at least 164 people dead, while 171 remain missing. Majority of which are due to flashfloods and mudslides in the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Verification and validation from local government authorities are still ongoing.

“The focus at the moment is to find those who are still missing and to alleviate the suffering of those who survived. Slowly but surely, you can be sure the Red Cross will continue to be there for the people affected,” he said.

Gordon said the PRC will be immediately distributing P3,000 cash grants to 1,500 families from worst-hit communities. The priority will be the most vulnerable such as those who lost a family member and single parents.

“This is the fastest way we can bring assistance to our people. People are hungry before, now they are hungrier because of the typhoon. We want to give hope again to our people,” he added.

The PRC through the support of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will be distributing 1,000 non-food items in the coming days.

He added that more water tankers would be sent to provide clean water to the affected communities.

The storm is moving west at a speed of 15-20km per hour and is forecast to be off the waters of Trà Vinh to Cà Mau at about 7am today. Wind speeds hit 75-90km per hour, according to the National Hydrometeorological Forecast Centre.

The storm is projected to keep moving west for the next 12-24 hours and gradually weaken into a tropical depression. The eye of the depression is forecast to be off the Gulf of Thailand at 7pm today.

The typhoon has already affected some localities which have experienced rains up to 50mm from yesterday evening.

The centre also warned of flash floods and landslides in some areas from Quảng Ngãi to Bình Thuận, Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu and Kiên Giang due to heavy rains and rising seawater.

Localities in the south have taken various measures to prepare for the storm.

Côn Đảo District and Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province have called for all vessels operating in Côn Đảo’s waters to return to safety. All tourists on the island have been evacuated to shelters.

Nguyễn Văn Dũng, vice chairman of the People’s Committee of Côn Đảo District, said the province has instructed forces to call on fishermen to return to storm shelters.

The Mekong Delta province of Sóc Trăng has evacuated more than 30,000 people to safe places while calling for nearly 1,200 vessels operating offshore to find shelter.

The province’s leaders have directed agencies, forces and households to speed up the harvest of shrimp and rice to avoid storm damage.

Tiền Giang Province also evacuated nearly 35,000 people in high risks areas to safer places. Thousands of soldiers were mobilised to strengthen the dyke system and houses.

Many localities have allowed pupils to stay home from schools and industrial zone workers to be off work.

**Deputy PM inspects typhoon preparedness**

Deputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng yesterday visited Sóc Trăng to inspect preparations for Typhoon Tembin.

In Trần Đề district and Vĩnh Châu township, the Deputy PM visited a dock where 600 ships are sheltering from the storm and several storm shelters for people in Vĩnh Châu township.

Chairman of the provincial People’s Committee Trần Văn Chuyện told the Deputy PM that the province has mobilised all resources to minimise losses, adding the evacuation work was fulfilled on December 24, with 27,000 people moving to schools and agencies’ headquarters.

Later the same day, Deputy PM Dũng also visited Bạc Liêu and Cà Mau provinces to inspect their preparedness, dyke systems and evacuation plan.

The same day, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường, also head of the Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, led a working delegation to inspect preparedness for the storm in Khánh Hội area, U Minh district, in Cà Mau Province.

Cường then met with authorities of neighbouring Kiên Giang Province about its work to cope with Tembin, the 16th storm to hit the East Sea this year.

**Many flights cancelled**

Vietnam Airlines and several other carriers have cancelled or adjusted the schedule of many flights to and from areas to be affected by typhoon Tembin.

The national flag carrier cancelled all flights from 12:40 to 20:30 yesterday on routes between Hà Nội/HCM City and Phú Quốc in the southern province of Kiên Giang, and between Hà Nội and the Mekong Delta city of Cần Thơ.

Passengers affected by the cancellations will be arranged to fly on the next day.

Meanwhile, the schedule of flights from 15:00 to 23:00 yesterday will be adjusted according to the latest reports on Tembin, and will be updated frequently on Vietnam Airlines’ website and Facebook.

Jetstar Pacific will adjust its flights to and from Tân Sơn Nhất Airport in HCM City and Phú Quốc Island depending on the movement of the typhoon.

Due to the changes, a number of domestic flights are expected to be delayed. Passengers can get information on the carriers’ official websites or Facebook, as well as ticket offices. — VNS

2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",4603,"Shelter and Non-Food Items"
2393194,"Solar power brings light to Congolese refugees in Angola **LOUVA, Angola** – Since the outbreak of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kasai region earlier this year, nearly 35,000 refugees have poured into Angola’s Lunda Norte Province.

The population is highly vulnerable. Some 75 per cent of refugees from Kasai are women and children, according to UN reports. Many refugees have reported witnessing mass killings, rape and other human rights abuses during their flight from conflict.

Ester, 25, recounted the frenzy of her departure. “It was the day when the war arrived to our village. They were killing people. I was not able to take anything with me, only my children,” she said.

Humanitarian groups are working to relocate many of the refugees from the Cacanda reception centre to a new settlement in Lóvua.

The new location allows the refugees to have some privacy and space for farming, but it is not connected to an electrical grid, so the refugees are left in total darkness when the sun sets – a problem for their safety and security.

Ester’s family recently moved into the settlement. “We are living in the bush. I do not have any lamps, and no light. It makes me feel afraid,” she said. “There is, for example, no light for us to be able to go to the toilet during night.” 

**Darkness poses risks**

Around the world, women and girls report being threatened or assaulted when leaving home at night to relieve themselves or manage their menstrual hygiene. These risks are elevated in crisis settings, when social safety nets, law enforcement and other protection mechanisms break down.

Darkness poses other risks as well. Women who go into labour at night, for example, may have trouble getting to clinics or being properly treated without a reliable light source.

“Light is important to help maintain the safety and rights of women and adolescents at night,” said Florbela Fernandes, UNFPA’s representative in Angola.

**Portable sunshine**

UNFPA is working with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to provide 50 solar-powered units to community centres, medical facilities and other communal spaces in the Lóvua refugee settlement. 

The units, donated by Panasonic, consist of a solar panel, three LED lamps, and a rechargeable battery that can also be used to charge mobile phones.

“We hope these solar lamps can be installed in public facilities to be able to extend the services and provide light in the dark,” said Yuzo Kitamoto, deputy representative for the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Angola, after a visit to Lóvua in December.

Women and girls arriving in Lóvua are also receiving solar-powered torches, part of the dignity kits that are a standard part of UNFPA’s humanitarian response. Some 2,000 dignity kits – which contain hygiene items such as soap, underwear and sanitary napkins – are being handed out, with more on the way. 

UNFPA is additionally partnering with the UN Refugee Agency to deliver solar street lights to the settlement. And in partnership with Médicos del Mundo, UNFPA has set up women-friendly spaces, where women and girls can rest, socialize, and learn where to receive reproductive health services and help for survivors of gender-based violence.

As for Ester, she is determined to move forward. “I hope for a good life with my family here in Angola,” she said. “I am too afraid to return now.”

In an effort to better understand market dynamics in Libya, the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) was initiated by the Libya Cash & Markets Working Group (CMWG) in June 2017. The initiative is guided by the CMWG Markets Taskforce, led by REACH and supported by the CMWG members.

Markets in key urban areas across Libya are assessed on a monthly basis. In each location, field teams record prices and availability of basic food and nonfood items (NFI) sold in local shops and markets.

This factsheet presents an overview of price ranges and medians for key foods and NFIs in the assessed areas. The cleaned data sets are available on the REACH Resource Centre and distributed to CMWG partners, as well as to the broader humanitarian community.

In future rounds, the factsheet will include a Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB), which represents the minimum culturally adjusted group of items required to support a Libyan household for one month. The prices associated with the SMEB will illustrate variations in prices across assessed locations. The SMEB will be included once it has been agreed upon by all partners and may not contain all items assessed in the previous rounds.",4603,"Shelter and Non-Food Items"

It then intensified into a severe tropical storm and affected directly in its path eastern Mindanao, western Mindanao, central Mindanao, and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); where the city of Marawi is located. The full extent of the devastation is becoming clearer as the most remote areas are becoming accessible.

- According to the Department of Social Welfare and Develoment (DSWD), A total of 313 498 persons are affeted in 998 barangays, the smallest administrative divisions in the country, mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao. A total of 20 870 families or 97 583 persons are currently staying inside 261 evacuation centres. In terms of casualties, final figures have yet to be released, medias have put the estimates at least 240 fatalities, and 100 missing. Much of the casualties resulted from flash flooding and landslides.

- Similarly, the combined effects of the storm, flash floods and land-slides have caused extensive damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and other basic social services, thus further adversely affecting the livelihood and coping strategies, and increasing the vulnerabilities of both host communities and internally displaced people (IDPs) from the conflict of Marawi city, who are still far from recovering from the conflict.

- The most imminent humanitarian needs appear to be: Shelter as many houses were destroyed. WASH, in some areas people are forced to get water from unsecured sources and water kits are either destroyed or washed away. Food, food stocks were washed away or depleted and even prior disaster malnutrition amongst communities has been recorded.

- Two DG ECHO experts are currently assessing the situation on the ground.

- On 26 December, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) issued an emergency appeal of CHF 2.8 million (EUR 2.4 million) to support 20 000 affected people.",4603,"Shelter and Non-Food Items"
2392854,"Somalia: Shelter Cluster Factsheet, November 2017 **CLUSTER SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES**

SO1: Contribute to the protection of newly displaced people and those affected by natural hazards. (NFIs, ESKs)  
SO2: Improve the living conditions of the protracted internally displaced persons (Transitional shelters, NFIs)  
SO3: Facilitate access to durable solutions for IDPs that are willing to locally integrate or return (Permanent shelters)  

**NEEDS ANALYSIS** 

• 1,090,000 newly displaced people are in need of Shelter/NFI assistance. The majority of the displacement is to Baidoa and Mogadishu. The displaced families are confronted with the need of shelter and other household non-food items.

• Nearly 1.4 million protracted Internally Displaced people exist countrywide • Safe and secure settlements are needed to provide crisisaffected communities with protected and healthy living spaces and environments, while ensuring sufficient privacy and dignity.  

**GAPS / CHALLENGES**

- Drought displacements are now taking a protracted trend, with many of those displaced in 2017 not planning to return to areas of origin.

- Many IDP settlements risk evictions for lack of secure tenure. Advocacy is needed to reduce secondary displacements.

- The current dyer rains and flooding are causing further damage to already weak shelters, leaving many without shelter.

- Effective delivery of assistance is hampered by limited access, insecurity, road blocks / check points and poor road network.

- Low funding for Shelter and NFIs has left no stocks prepositioned for emergency response.

All that changed when the war happened and fighting started in her village. Suad and her family decided to leave all their belongings behind and flee; walking over 1,000km until they reached Idleb. They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent. Suad decided to borrow money from her neighbours and buy an old, second-hand sewing machine to bring in a little income.  

Learning about IOM’s Project from her husband, Suad applied and was soon accept- ed. “You can’t believe how happy I feel. I’ll be able to pay back the money I borrowed for the old sewing machine because it was quite a burden to us.” With the money she saved, she is able to support her family and buy medication for her sick husband. “I am getting closer to achieving my goal. I’ll work hard so I can take my kids from this tent to a decent apartment.

The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent.

million people, half of the population of Somalia, will need humanitarian assistance and protection due
to the ongoing drought and conflict. Over two million IDPs are among those who are in urgent need of
assistance.1 Several reports by the monitoring agencies indicated that in a scenario of continued
assistance at current levels, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible. Large-scale assistance is

awareness on best hygienic practices and improving the drainage system. UNHCR has assisted 9,866
people affected by rains: 7,266 persons benefited from kits, which consist of core relief items (CRIs),
1,400 benefited from hygiene kits and 1,200 benefited from awareness raising session on hygiene. In

2392134,"Philippines: IFRC warns of worsening conditions following deadly Tropical Storm Tembin Manila/Kuala Lumpur 26 December —Four days after tropical storm Tembin made landfall in Mindanao, thousands of survivors are still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.

“Our teams in Mindanao are doing all they can to reach everyone who needs them. But the work is difficult and often slow,” says Philippine Red Cross Chairman Gordon. “Around the world, people are spending this time period with their families. For people affected by Tembin, what should be a peaceful time is instead full of uncertainty and fear. We need to help them.”

As responders reach the worst affected areas, details of the havoc wrought by Tembin (known locally as “Vinta”) continue to emerge. More than 500,000 people in 23 provinces have been affected. The national disaster risk reduction and management council (NDRRMC) confirms that 164 people have lost their lives to the flashfloods and landslides, with 176 are still missing. The number of casualties is expected to increase as the public authorities verify information being received from the provinces.

In addition to causing the loss of human lives and internal displacement, Tembin has substantially impacted shelter and livelihoods and caused damage to crops and critical infrastructure including roads, bridges and power transmission lines.

Volunteers and search and rescue teams from the Philippine Red Cross have been active since the hours before the storm made landfall, and are now working to reach people in need with water, food, and emergency shelter. Hot meals are being served, and welfare services provided in the evacuation centers, where over 50,000 people are staying after being evacuated prior to the landfall of the storm.

To support these efforts, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is joining the Philippine Red Cross in [appealing](https://reliefweb.int/node/2392084) for 2.8 million Swiss francs to assist more than 20,000 people affected by the storm in four of the worst affected provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro.

“People have gone through a massive shock. In just minutes, they lost everything, and then had to fight for their lives as walls of mud and water washed through their homes,” says Patrick Elliott, IFRC Operations and Programmes Manager in the Philippines.

“Now we must ensure that affected communities have immediate access to essential items and services including cash, food, water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, as well to information, psychosocial support, and protection.”

NPM’s monthly site assessment rounds capture the numbers, locations and key sectoral needs of Rohingya refugees in the area affected by the influx since 25 August 2017. Data is collected through key informant interviews and direct observation.  
The unit of data collection depends on the setting. In the Makeshift Sites and their Expansions it is a ‘block,’ defined as an area of responsibility of one mahjee, usually around 100 households. The blocks are not always spatially contiguous and may have gaps. In the villages it is the village itself, and in towns it is a refugee community, typically smaller than 100 households, although with a few exceptions.  
On these Site Profiles all these units are collectively called ‘locations’. The data is aggregated up to the zone level in the sites and camps and to the upazila level outside of them.

- BRAC's total coverage (based on sanitation) is 563,400 people with installation of 14,085 latrines (104 today). BRAC ensures access to safe water for 366,840 people through 1,265 shallow tube wells, 83 deep tube wells and three ring wells. 3,735 bathing cubicles were set up (53 today); especially for women and adolescent girls. A total of 3,378 latrines have been de-sludged (157 today) and made functional for reusing. 773 latrines have been decommissioned. A total of 37,116 hygiene sessions have been conducted.

- BRAC's 10 primary health centers and 50 satellite clinics have provided 638,108 services (7,178 patients today). 78,456 cases of pneumonia (976 today) and 81,051 cases of diarrhoea have been treated (916 today). BRAC has helped to deliver 398 babies so far and five of them were born today.

- BRAC helped to vaccinate 14,393 children during the immunisation campaign against diphtheria. 180 BRAC volunteers were involved in bringing 82,096 children to government vaccination centres. BRAC has identified 394 diphtheria cases (13 today) and referred for isolation. 279 health workers and 1,129 programme staff have been trained to handle diphtheria cases.

- Some 35,829 children received recreational support through 213 child friendly spaces (CFS).

- 15,855 children have access to 151 learning centres and 300 teachers have been assigned to guide them.

- 61,711 household visits to disseminate life saving messages have been completed (16,191 today) by community mobilisation volunteers. So far, orientation training of 800 volunteers and 107 staff has been completed.

**KEY CHALLENGES**

**Community’s resistance**

Sometimes local mosques show resistance towards the child friendly space activities. Thus, influential members of the community itself, such as religious leaders (imams), need to be engaged in productive discussion to increase understanding of the necessity of these activities. Active community membership and productive engagement in child protection committees can also play a significant role in opening the mindsets of the people.

**Access to market**

Rice is availed as a relief item; however, other food items (protein or vegetables) need to acquired to ensure a balanced diet. Although many FDMNs have cash, they are unable to purchase these additional items as the markets places are far from settlement and are hard to access. Another problem is that women do not have a way to earn money, as their skills may be limited to what they can produce (e.g. sew clothes and sell) and also being unable to utilise the local markets.",4603,"Shelter and Non-Food Items"

The activities under Water and Sanitation will no longer be conducted as other actors in the country such as UNICEF and other UN agencies in coordination with the local authorities are covering these needs. The Emergency Appeal is currently being revised and these changes will be reflected. The revised Emergency Appeal will be focused in carrying out roof repairs in coordination with the local authorities.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

**A.2 Summary of current response**

**Overview of Host National Society**

4,225 volunteers are activated, of which 2,533 are from the operations and relief groups carrying out recovery work in the affected regions in sanitation and epidemic control including 531 volunteers working in the protection centres.

**Overview of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement in the country**

The IFRC continues providing support and coordination with the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) through its Country Cluster Support Team based in Dominican Republic, and through the Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) based in Panama. The Country Cluster Support Team and the regional disaster management coordinator (also emergency shelter focal point) are giving the support to all the response actions of this operation. The sectors and needs addressed by this Emergency Appeal were identified by the CRC in coordination with the government.

The Spanish Red Cross, who has had presence in the country, deployed one staff member to support the National Society’s response efforts. In addition, on the onset of the emergency and on 9 October, two staff members from the Canadian Red Cross Society were deployed to Cuba with the aim to contribute to the response requirements of the Cuban Red Cross.

The Cuban Red Cross coordinated bilaterally with the Spanish Red Cross, through its permanent cooperation program, a shipment of new clothes and footwear for adults, and psycho-pedagogical centres including children without subsidiary protection.

**Movement Coordination**

The Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) has been sharing official information from the CRC with all Movement members. The CRC led coordination meetings at country level with the Spanish Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Society.

At the onset of Hurricane Irma, communication was established with Movement partners to inform of the storm’s path through the Caribbean.

  PRC Chairman and CEO Richard Gordon said staff and volunteers from the 31 chapters in Mindanao and its National Headquarters are currently responding and closely monitoring the situation as Tropical Storm Vinta traverses the country. 

  “When the world no longer watches, the Philippine Red Cross stays to do what must be done. We are one in helping the most vulnerable, banking on our fundamental principle of humanity,” Gordon said.

   He added that the PRC also mobilized 82 staff and 1,955 volunteers from its 24 chapters in the Visayas to help those affected by Tropical Storm Urduja, which made a total of six landfalls on December 16.

  “I would like to commend the families of our staff and volunteers who continuously share their loved ones withus so they can be of service to humanity. This is the true spirit of the holiday season,” he added. 

‘Vinta’ Response

   For Vinta alone, the PRC has so far provided hot meals to 1,880 individuals and psychosocial support to 856people. 

  PRC volunteers were also first to respond when a ceiling of the Butuan City Jail collapsed during the height of Vinta last Friday. 

  Prepositioned non-food items from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for 1,000 families are also ready for distribution at the Philippine Red Cross Chapter in Cagayan de Oro.

‘Urduja’ Response

  Philippine Red Cross teams were among the first on the ground to assess and monitor the situation in the aftermath of Urduja. 

  So far, the Red Cross was able to provide rescue, welfare assistance, first aid management, hot meals, psychosocial support, and relief goods in Urduja-affected communities.

  Some 240 families received sleeping kits, which include blankets, towels, and plastic mats. Food items were also distributed to 651 affected families. Some 8,185individuals were provided with hot meals and 169 people were given psychosocial support.

  It can be recalled that the PRC was among the first to access Biliran province, one of the hardest hit areas by Urduja. The PRC set up a 5,000-liter water bladder at the Biliran Provincial Hospital to provide water regularly to patients and nearby residents, and provided anti-tetanus vaccines to injured individuals. 

   The Philippine Red Cross, as the foremost humanitarian organization in the country, has 103 chapters with two million volunteers nationwide that is always first, always ready and always there to provide round-the-clock humanitarian assistance, especially to the most vulnerable.

2391614,"‘Inexperienced’ south braces for Typhoon Tembin SOUTHERN REGION —  As Typhoon Tembin approaches the mainland, “inexperienced” localities in the south, which rarely face heavy storms, are actively preparing for worst case scenarios.

These include mass evacuations, closure of schools and businesses, and strict bans on fishing vessels venturing out to sea.

Agriculture Minister Nguyễn Xuân Cường, head of the National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention, Search and Rescue, has warned that Tembin is the most powerful ‘late season storm’ to ever enter Vietnamese waters.

The committee, in its meeting on Saturday, noted that local people and authorities of southern provinces were in general “inexperienced” in dealing with powerful storms, and the region’s infrastructure was not designed to be storm-resistant, but this time, “serious efforts must be expended to be ready for the storm.”

Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc yesterday issued a dispatch, asking localities and agencies not to be “complacent” and “avoid past mistakes.”

Experts have said that losses inflicted by the recent typhoon Damrey and the 1997 Linda typhoon would not have been so tragic had people heeded warnings and made proper preparations.

**Local preparations**

In the Mekong Delta’s Cần Thơ City, authorities have urged localities seen as vulnerable to evacuate residents to safe places.

Typhoon Tembin, the 16th tropical storm to enter the East Sea this year, is likely to force over 137,000 people in Cần Thơ to relocate. Significant damage to infrastructure and crops is also foreseen.

Typhoon Tembin, which landed in the Philippines on December 23, killing 200 people and leaving dozens of others missing, is forecast to also impact a number of other Mekong Delta localities. 

At 4pm on December 24, the storm’s centre was 120km east of Việt Nam’s Trường Sa Lớn island, the fourth largest one in the Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelago, with sustained wind speeds of 115-135km per hour.

According to the National Centre for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF), in the next 24 hours, the storm will head fast westward at 25km per hour, causing strong waves that can seriously threaten infrastructure on the Spratly Archipelago.

At 10am of December 25, the storm’s centre can be expected at about 220km east of Côn Đảo Island, off the waters of Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Province. Strongest wind speeds may reach 115-135 km per hour.

On Saturday, leaders of Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Province inspected preparatory work at local coastal localities including Vũng Tàu City and the districts of Long Điền, Đất Đỏ and Xuyên Mộc.

According to the Vũng Tàu People’s Committee, 49 ships with 362 crew on board are currently operating at sea. All of them have been updated about the storm’s developments and advised to seek shelter immediately.

The city has set up two evacuation plans for 16,500 households with 36,752 people.

Meanwhile, the southernmost province of Cà Mau has banned all fishing vessels from leaving the shore as of 16:00 on December 23. Authorities have contacted 862 fishing boats operating at sea, including 372 offshore fishing vessels, and asked them to find shelter. So far, 743 vessels have docked in safe ports.

The provincial People’s Committee also asked agencies, departments and localities to call on locals to reinforce their houses and production facilities so as to minimise losses.

As many as 250,000 students and teachers in Cà Mau Province, including tens of thousands in coastal localities, have been allowed to stay at home on December 25-26, just in case typhoon hits the province.

Similarly, HCM City’s coastal district of Cần Giờ has also shut down schools on December 25-26 and directed nearly 1100 vessels to safely anchor at ports. Preparations have been made to evacuate 5,000 people living in unsafe houses to schools, culture centres, and government buildings in the worst case scenarios.

HCM City authorities have also directed the city’s power utility to ensure continuous supply of power during and after the storm.

On December 24, the People’s Committee of Đồng Tháp Province convened an urgent meeting with 12 localities to launch plans to cope with the storm. Committee Chairman Nguyễn Văn Dương has asked the localities to update locals on storm developments, reinforce dykes and irrigation works, and promptly complete crop harvesting. 

Khương Lê Bình, director of Đồng Tháp’s weather agency, said that when the typhoon makes landfall, localities from Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu to Cà Mau will be directly affected.

The People’s Committee of Bạc Liêu Province started relocating locals from risky places on Saturday. Bạc Liêu plans to move over 85,000 households with 365,700 people in 31,000 vulnerable locations.

More than 12,000 people and 24,000 vehicles have been mobilised. The province has also applied measures to protect 33,000 hectares of rice-shrimp farms, 46,000 hectares of rice fields and 76,000 hectares of aquaculture farms.

Bạc Liêu has 1,232 fishing vessels, of which 177 are operating at sea and heading to the port.

In Tây Ninh province, locals residing around Dầu Tiếng Lake, Sài Gòn and Vàm Cỏ rivers have been asked to move to safer places and reinforce their houses.

Heavy rain and strong winds are forecast in Tây Ninh for December 25-26.

Earlier, on Friday, the central province of Bình Thuận banned fishing vessels from going to sea from 16:00. The 252 vessels with 1,875 people on board operating at sea on Friday have been informed of the storm and asked to seek safe shelters.

**Emergency meeting**

Yesterday PM Phúc also chaired an online meeting with leaders of southern localities expected to be affected by the typhoon Tembin.

PM Phúc demanded that the authorities quickly guide farmers to harvest their crops early and take ‘forceful measures’ to prevent fishing vessels from violating the sea travel ban before and during the storm.

According to the national steering committee, all localities have issued a ban on fishing activities starting December 23.

Four provinces and cities have reported their progress on evacuation and 13,564 people out of 853,604 residents in the high-risk areas in the nine southern provinces have been relocated.

However, the Prime Minister ordered that some sections of sea dykes stretching 276 km along the 774 km of the southern coast need to be watched carefully as they were recently consolidated to guard only against weaker storms with lower waves. Twenty-three ‘critical’ points have been identified from Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu to Cà Mau Province. — VNS",4603,"Shelter and Non-Food Items"

To ensure sustainable reintegration of Somali refugee returnees, UNHCR provides the enhanced return package2 . Detailed achievements throughout November are presented below per sector.

**Protection and Return Support**

**Return Management**

■ The Government of Kenya have now authorized resumption of road convoys to Somalia but due to rainfalls in the region (Dhobley town, Lower Juba region), most of the return routes are not accessible, making return by road not feasible.

■ Flights to Kismayo have resumed on 21 November. The suspension was put in place on 28 September after the State of Jubaland imposed new landing fees on UN flights. The last return flight from Kenya to Kismayo was received on 28 September.

**Protection Monitoring**

■ UNHCR has shared the Country of Origin Information (COI) for the month of October with the Return Help Desk in Refugee Camps in Kenya and Yemen. The COI includes information about the humanitarian, security and political situation in Somalia. The COI helps Somali refugees make an informed decision about their return.

■ During November, the pilot phase of UNHCR’s new post-returns monitoring system commenced across South Central Somalia. Consultations were held with partners in Mogadishu before the rollout of the telephonic monitoring began. The new monitoring system includes a face-to-face survey.

**Return Figures**

Since the beginning of repatriation in 2014, a total of 109,317 Somalis returned to Somalia; 74,606 from Kenya, 34,077 from Yemen (33,667 spontaneous and 418 assisted) and 626 from other countries of asylum (589 from Djibouti, 34 from Eritrea, two from Tunisia, and one from Pakistan).

Severe malnutrition was reported among 1518 patients, of which 88% were children aged under 5 years. 1860 patients presented with suspected measles or rubella, of which over 20% were among individuals aged five years and older. 

The frequency of respiratory infection, skin diseases and diarrhoea reflected in these reports is associated with poor living conditions with lack of essential hygiene and a high population density. The high number of patients presenting with injury, 6897, also needs to be investigated, as this may reflect poor living conditions that contribute to preventable morbidity.

“Other” conditions accounted for 318 661 cases (51.3% of all reported conditions), with 83% among people aged 5 years or older. Further investigation of this group will be conducted as a priority to assess the main causes of disease constituting this large category, in particular the incidence of non-communicable and/or chronic diseases that can lead to death if not treated (such as tuberculosis, diabetes and cardiac dysfunction), and psychiatric and psychological conditions that require specialized care.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

2393444,"DOH augments medical supplies, health teams for Vinta victims MANILA, Dec. 26 -- Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III today immediately ordered the augmentation of medicines and other medical supplies in regions hit by tropical storm “Vinta” in Mindanao to respond to the immediate health needs of thousands of affected families and communities. 

""The DOH expresses its sympathy to our countrymen on this tragic event especially with the loss of lives and with many still reported missing along with their homes which were destroyed by flash floods and landslides. This is very sad especially at this time when families should be celebrating Christmas and preparing for the festivities of the New Year,"" Duque lamented. The health chief also appealed to the public any assistance they can provide to those affected by the disaster.

Secretary Duque also reported that flash floods and landslide incidents occurred in Zamboanga del Norte, while the municipality of Carmen, Daval del Norte has now been declared under state of calamity. 

A total of 70,454 families or 320,180 individuals are affected in 569 barangays in MIMAROPA, Central Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Central Mindanao, Davao region, ARMM and CARAGA. 

At the moment, the Department of Health is still on alert and concerned regional offices are instructed to deploy emergency response teams to provide the needed health services to the affected population, and ordered continuous coordination with their respective Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils. 

Also, the DOH Davao regional office has emergency medical teams to Talomo North District, Marilog District, Bunangin District and District A to provide health consultations and treatments. DOH Central Visayas provided technical services on water sanitation, hygiene and nutrition services. 

The DOH Central Mindanao augmented assorted medicines to rural health units of Pantao Ragat and Balo-1 for internally-displaced people inside and outside of evacuation centers, started leptospirosis prophylaxis to exposed individuals, augmented doxycycline in Northern Mindanao Medical Center and provided health teachings on the proper use of water treatment solutions. 

""I appeal to every Filipino to extend any assistance to families affected and displaced by tropical depression Vinta. Let us extend our kindness and compassion to those who have been severely hit by this tragedy,"" Secretary Duque concluded. (DOH)",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2393439,"Venezuela Situation Update, November 2017 The total number of Venezuelans in Colombia has more than doubled in less than four months, reaching 660,000 individuals, end-November, up from 300,000 in June.

Between January and October 2017 over 100.000 Venezuelan nationals have entered Peru through the northern entry point in Tumbes, according to authorities.

In Brazil 15,645 Venezuelans have lodged asylum claims in 2017, 1,680 Temporary Residence Permits have been granted and a total of 30,000 are estimated to live in the country.

**POPULATION OF CONCERN** 

- In November the movements from Venezuela to Colombia continued to grow, according to government figures that show net arrivals from Venezuelans reached 4,000 people per day (up from 3,500 in October), and 2,500 Colombian returnees per day. Colombian authorities also reported that some 200,000 have crossed into Ecuador. 

- Over 1 million Venezuelans have now registered for the Border Mobility Card (TMF) in Colombia. 

- In Peru 19,000 Venezuelans have applied for the Temporary Permanence Permit (PTP), Peruvian authorities estimate. Since August 4,000 PTPs have been issued out of that total. 

- At least 60,000 Venezuelans are estimated to be residing in the Southern Caribbean. 

- In Brazil some 15,000 of all Venezuelan asylum-claims have been lodged in Roraima border state since 2014, 2,500 in Amazonas state and some 590 in Sao Paulo.

**CONTEXT INFORMATION**

Over one million Venezuelans have left their country, according to host Government figures. Over 106,000 have sought asylum since 2014, more than half in 2017. Some 190,000 have also applied for alternative legal status across the region. They claim they are leaving for a variety of reasons, including threats by armed groups; fear of being targeted on account of their political opinion, real or perceived; insecurity and violence; lack of food, medicine and access to essential social services, as well as loss of income.

UNHCR has also identified hundreds of indigenous people crossing the borders, primarily into Colombia and Brazil. These groups sometimes travel long distances by land and have shown to be highly vulnerable as they do not have the financial resources to buy food or shelter. Additional support has been provided to them.

While the dialogue between the Government and the opposition coalition has restarted in the Dominican Republic, people continue to steadily leave the country. The socio-economic situation increasingly deteriorates and inflation has made it extremely difficult to access food, medicine, basic products and services. Reports from international organizations state that there is a considerable number of people with chronic malnutrition in the country, as well as a shortage of medicine. As a result of the strained resources, insecurity has also been increasing and having a rising impact on peoples’ lives.

**Operational Context**

**Brazil**

- The Government of Roraima has declared a state of social emergency due to the “intense, unlimited and disorderly flow of Venezuelans without means or conditions to sustain themselves” that arrive from Venezuela. Local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to provide an adequate security and health response, as well as to implement the recent government resolution that establishes standard operation procedures for the protection of unaccompanied and separated children, based on the recommendations by UNHCR.

- Among the reasons given by the Warao for leaving Venezuela, is that the government’s support to indigenous communities in the country has ceased. They claim that there are no available schools, health centres or services. Water distribution, usually their only source of potable water, has allegedly also stopped. The Warao also stated that they suffered discrimination in the access to ID- documents, which could help explain the considerable amount of Warao without identification arriving in Brazil.

- The Warao continue to move inward, confirming their intent to stay. Over 200 Warao are living in Pará state. The majority is living on the streets, while some 70 people are staying in a rural school set up as a temporary shelter by the Municipality. Following UNHCR’s counsel, Amazonas and Pará authorities created a formal communication channel to exchange experiences and lessons learned.

**Colombia**

- Armed groups activities at the Colombian-Venezuela border, incursions by the Venezuelan military into Colombia, confrontations between governments and the lack of capacity to control the actions of armed actors on both sides of the border are increasing risks for persons of concern in these areas. UNHCR continues to monitor the reports of violence at the border.

- In October, a pamphlet was distributed in Arauca by the “Araucan Social Cleansing Group”, accusing Venezuelan men of selling drugs to children and committing crimes and Venezuelan women of being prostitutes, and called for them to go back to Venezuela or face assassination.

- Colombian authorities are concerned about the spread of diseases including malaria, measles, diphtheria and tuberculosis in reception areas. They state that due to a lack of health access in Venezuela, arrivals are boosting transmission rates. More than 19,000 Venezuelans have received emergency treatment in Colombia, increasing pressure on local services. The Government is working with the Red Cross and WHO/PAHO to increase services, and UNHCR is advocating to ensure a protection-sensitive approach.

- The Special Stay Permit (PEP) application deadline expired on 31 October. Over 67,000 Venezuelans applied for the permit, which allows them to regularize their status, work and access basic services for up to two years in Colombia. UNHCR is advocating for this measure to be extended to ensure that legal pathways remain open, as is the case in other countries in the region.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2393399,"Philippine Red Cross appeals for aid for 500,000 people affected by ‘Vinta’ The Philippine Red Cross(PRC) appealed for humanitarian aid to help the more than 500,000 people affected by Typhoon Vinta (Tembin), which hit 23 provinces in the Philippines before Christmas day. 

PRC Chairman Richard Gordon made the appeal as figures on the number of deaths and missing people from the flashfloods and landslides that struck parts of Mindanao continue to rise in the wake of ‘Vinta’.

“Rural communities, which are in remote mountainous areas, are the hardest hit. Some villages are swept away by surging current of mud and water. We’re really in our toes right now. We’re trying to figure out how to bring our help closer to our people who are suffering right now” Gordon said. 

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) on Monday reported at least 164 people dead, while 171 remain missing. Majority of which are due to flashfloods and mudslides in the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Verification and validation from local government authorities are still ongoing.

“The focus at the moment is to find those who are still missing and to alleviate the suffering of those who survived. Slowly but surely, you can be sure the Red Cross will continue to be there for the people affected,” he said.

Gordon said the PRC will be immediately distributing P3,000 cash grants to 1,500 families from worst-hit communities. The priority will be the most vulnerable such as those who lost a family member and single parents.

“This is the fastest way we can bring assistance to our people. People are hungry before, now they are hungrier because of the typhoon. We want to give hope again to our people,” he added.

The PRC through the support of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will be distributing 1,000 non-food items in the coming days.

He added that more water tankers would be sent to provide clean water to the affected communities. 

Those with missing family members would also be assisted PRC’s Restoring Family Links Program

PRC volunteers and staff have been active on the ground providing round-the-clock humanitarian assistance even before the storm made landfall and during Christmas day.

So far, it already provided hot meals to 5,039 individuals and psychosocial support to 1,728.

PRC emergency responders also rescued 339 people and distributed 108,000 liters of water. 

So far, the Qatar Red Crescent Society has responded to PRC’s appeal and donated P14-million ($280,000) for the provision of additional food items, non-food items, water, sanitation and emergency shelter.

The Manila Bulletin also donated P1 million to support PRC’s ongoing emergency and relief operations.

The Philippine Red Cross, as the foremost humanitarian organization in the country, has 103 chapters with two million volunteers nationwide.

Aside from disaster responses, PRC’s services include health, welfare, safety, blood, volunteer service, and Red Cross youth.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

It then intensified into a severe tropical storm and affected directly in its path eastern Mindanao, western Mindanao, central Mindanao, and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); where the city of Marawi is located. The full extent of the devastation is becoming clearer as the most remote areas are becoming accessible.

- According to the Department of Social Welfare and Develoment (DSWD), A total of 313 498 persons are affeted in 998 barangays, the smallest administrative divisions in the country, mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao. A total of 20 870 families or 97 583 persons are currently staying inside 261 evacuation centres. In terms of casualties, final figures have yet to be released, medias have put the estimates at least 240 fatalities, and 100 missing. Much of the casualties resulted from flash flooding and landslides.

- Similarly, the combined effects of the storm, flash floods and land-slides have caused extensive damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and other basic social services, thus further adversely affecting the livelihood and coping strategies, and increasing the vulnerabilities of both host communities and internally displaced people (IDPs) from the conflict of Marawi city, who are still far from recovering from the conflict.

- The most imminent humanitarian needs appear to be: Shelter as many houses were destroyed. WASH, in some areas people are forced to get water from unsecured sources and water kits are either destroyed or washed away. Food, food stocks were washed away or depleted and even prior disaster malnutrition amongst communities has been recorded.

- Two DG ECHO experts are currently assessing the situation on the ground.

- On 26 December, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) issued an emergency appeal of CHF 2.8 million (EUR 2.4 million) to support 20 000 affected people.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

All that changed when the war happened and fighting started in her village. Suad and her family decided to leave all their belongings behind and flee; walking over 1,000km until they reached Idleb. They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent.

2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2392184,"Severe malnutrition tops 11% in Bangladesh refugee camps - World Vision study 21 December 2017 (Cox's Bazar) – A recent nutrition screening of 1,862 children in Balukhali, Jamtoli and Thangkhali refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh found 199 (11 per cent) children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), according to child-focused World Vision, which conducted the seven-week assessment ending mid-December. 

“This data is alarmingly high. Although the sample size is only a fraction of all the children under five in the camps, even one child with SAM puts us one step closer to a higher mortality rate,” said Fred Witteveen, national director of World Vision Bangladesh. Severe acute malnutrition, the most visible and extreme form of undernutrition, is one of the world’s leading causes of death among children under five. 

Based on joint aid agency data from Cox’s Bazar in mid-December, of more than 35,000 children diagnosed with SAM, 18,083 have been admitted to therapeutic feeding centers for treatment, while close to 17,000 children are still in need of treatment. A recent multi-agency emergency nutrition assessment showed the prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) among all children 6-59 months of age at 24 per cent. The World Health Organization threshold for declaring a nutrition emergency is 15 per cent.

**Contributing causes** 

Poor access to clean water and improved sanitation can hurt a child’s nutritional status through diarrhoeal diseases and intestinal infections. 

According to a 3 December report in Cox’s Bazar, more than half a million people do not have adequate access to clean water and sanitation in and around the camps. Donors have funded only 23 percent of what is needed to provide 1.2 million people with sufficient water and basic sanitation. The continued arrival of refugees has further stretched already scarce facilities. Of the more than 5,300 tube wells installed, only 70 per cent work properly, while a little over one-third of the 35,650 temporary latrines are already not working. 

“Precarious access to and lack of these basic facilities in the camps can prove fatal, especially for children and others with weakened immunity,” shared Witteveen. “Most arrived in poor nutritional condition. We are racing to avoid the fatal tipping point many face.” 

To date, World Vision in partnership with UNICEF, has distributed hygiene kits and jerry cans to 14,500 people while hygiene promotion that targets at least 30,000 individuals has begun. Construction of 1,200 latrines, 600 gender sensitive bathing cubicles and 55 deep tube wells is also on-going, in close coordination with experts to ensure all facilities meet emergency response standards. World Vision has established four women and young child spaces to educate pregnant women and lactating mothers on child survival. 

Fighting that broke out almost four months ago in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State has forced out some 655,000 people to date into Bangladesh, almost all who identify as Rohingya. The population of the largest camp in Cox’s Bazar, known locally as Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, has multiplied more than five times since late August, now topping 547,000 people.

- 40,740 individuals (7,365 households) were provided with potable water in Togdheer, Sanaag and Lower Juba regions through borehole rehabilitation and water trucking.

- 9,483 individuals were reached with Gender Based Violence (GBV) response. 7,227 individuals in Mudug, 1,203 individuals in Bay, 753 individuals in Banadir and 300 individuals in Galgaduud regions through: identification of survivors, awareness raising & community engagement and legal, material, medical and psychosocial support, including provision of dignity kits and installation of solar lanterns.

**Situation overview**

From 1 to 30 November, the UNHCR-led Protection & Returns Monitoring Network (PRMN), recorded 32,000 new displacements (12,000 drought-related), bringing the total of internal displacements since the beginning of the year to 1,096,000, of which 874,000 attributable to the drought and 188,000 conflict related.

A spike in conflict driven displacements in multiple regions was observed during November - heightened military operations in Middle Shabelle (Balcad district) and ongoing conflict in Lower Shabelle were the major contributors (15,000 individuals).

While approximately 6,000 IDP returns were recorded in the month (2,000 in Mudug region and substantially all of the remainder in Bay region), these numbers appear low as the onset of the rainy season might be expected to catalyse larger IDP returns as those displaced return to home villages to plant or tend crops.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

**2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview**

On 29 November, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Somalia released the 2018
Humanitarian Needs Overview. The Humanitarian Needs Overview predicts that in 2018, over 6.2
million people, half of the population of Somalia, will need humanitarian assistance and protection due
to the ongoing drought and conflict. Over two million IDPs are among those who are in urgent need of
assistance.1 Several reports by the monitoring agencies indicated that in a scenario of continued
assistance at current levels, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible. Large-scale assistance is
needed through 2018 to prevent the loss of lives and collapse of livelihoods.

**16 Days of Activism against Sexual and Gender-based Violence**

On 25 November, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women,
UNHCR across the country launched the 16 days of activism against Sexual and Gender-based
Violence (SGBV) campaign. In the 16 days several activities were carried out by UNHCR and partners
with the theme “Leave no one behind – working together to end sexual and gender-based violence”.

**Floods affected people of concern and destroyed their shelters**

UNHCR field units (FU) in Dhobley and Baidoa reported that Deyr rain has affected IDPs in
various IDP settlements. The issues identified were collapsed latrines which pose health risks
(waterborne diseases) and destroyed shelters. Affected people are in need of hygiene kits, shelters,
awareness on best hygienic practices and improving the drainage system. UNHCR has assisted 9,866
people affected by rains: 7,266 persons benefited from kits, which consist of core relief items (CRIs),
1,400 benefited from hygiene kits and 1,200 benefited from awareness raising session on hygiene. In
Dhobley FU also advocated for alternative land for relocation of IDPs.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2392134,"Philippines: IFRC warns of worsening conditions following deadly Tropical Storm Tembin Manila/Kuala Lumpur 26 December —Four days after tropical storm Tembin made landfall in Mindanao, thousands of survivors are still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.

“Our teams in Mindanao are doing all they can to reach everyone who needs them. But the work is difficult and often slow,” says Philippine Red Cross Chairman Gordon. “Around the world, people are spending this time period with their families. For people affected by Tembin, what should be a peaceful time is instead full of uncertainty and fear. We need to help them.”

As responders reach the worst affected areas, details of the havoc wrought by Tembin (known locally as “Vinta”) continue to emerge. More than 500,000 people in 23 provinces have been affected. The national disaster risk reduction and management council (NDRRMC) confirms that 164 people have lost their lives to the flashfloods and landslides, with 176 are still missing. The number of casualties is expected to increase as the public authorities verify information being received from the provinces.

In addition to causing the loss of human lives and internal displacement, Tembin has substantially impacted shelter and livelihoods and caused damage to crops and critical infrastructure including roads, bridges and power transmission lines.

Volunteers and search and rescue teams from the Philippine Red Cross have been active since the hours before the storm made landfall, and are now working to reach people in need with water, food, and emergency shelter. Hot meals are being served, and welfare services provided in the evacuation centers, where over 50,000 people are staying after being evacuated prior to the landfall of the storm.

To support these efforts, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is joining the Philippine Red Cross in [appealing](https://reliefweb.int/node/2392084) for 2.8 million Swiss francs to assist more than 20,000 people affected by the storm in four of the worst affected provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro.

“People have gone through a massive shock. In just minutes, they lost everything, and then had to fight for their lives as walls of mud and water washed through their homes,” says Patrick Elliott, IFRC Operations and Programmes Manager in the Philippines.

“Now we must ensure that affected communities have immediate access to essential items and services including cash, food, water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, as well to information, psychosocial support, and protection.”

**MYANMAR**

An increase in tensions and armed clashes between the Myanmar Military, the Kachin Independence Army and other ethnic armed groups in Kachin and northern Shan states has been reported since early December. On the evening of 24 December, mortar shells landed near Woi Chyai IDP camp, where over 6,900 displaced people are hosted, and near civilians areas of Laiza, injuring a civilian, according to local humanitarian partners. A similar incident took place on 14 December resulting in the displacement of some 200 people, who remain are staying with host families. Local NGOs also reported that armed clashes in northern Shan State caused civilian casualties and that civilians are having difficulties leaving conflict-affected areas in Nahmkan Township.

**BANGLADESH**

As of 18 December, health partners reported 1,841 suspected cases of diphtheria among the Rohingya refugees, with 22 deaths recorded. The outbreak is primary in the Balukali makeshift and extension camps.  
Cases are also being reported from the Kutupalong extension, Thangkhali, Jamtoli, and Nyapara camps, where malnutrition, low routine immunization coverage, and poor access to clean water and sanitation facilities remain key concerns. A vaccination campaign is ongoing for over 400,000 children under 15 years old. Since August, 655,000 refugees crossed from Rakhine State (Myanmar) to Bangladesh. As of 26 December, the US$434 million Rohingya Refugee Crisis Humanitarian Response Plan is only 49.5 per cent funded.

NPM’s monthly site assessment rounds capture the numbers, locations and key sectoral needs of Rohingya refugees in the area affected by the influx since 25 August 2017. Data is collected through key informant interviews and direct observation.  
The unit of data collection depends on the setting. In the Makeshift Sites and their Expansions it is a ‘block,’ defined as an area of responsibility of one mahjee, usually around 100 households. The blocks are not always spatially contiguous and may have gaps. In the villages it is the village itself, and in towns it is a refugee community, typically smaller than 100 households, although with a few exceptions.

**KEY CHALLENGES**

**Community’s resistance**

Sometimes local mosques show resistance towards the child friendly space activities. Thus, influential members of the community itself, such as religious leaders (imams), need to be engaged in productive discussion to increase understanding of the necessity of these activities. Active community membership and productive engagement in child protection committees can also play a significant role in opening the mindsets of the people.

**Access to market**

Rice is availed as a relief item; however, other food items (protein or vegetables) need to acquired to ensure a balanced diet. Although many FDMNs have cash, they are unable to purchase these additional items as the markets places are far from settlement and are hard to access. Another problem is that women do not have a way to earn money, as their skills may be limited to what they can produce (e.g. sew clothes and sell) and also being unable to utilise the local markets.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

The activities under Water and Sanitation will no longer be conducted as other actors in the country such as UNICEF and other UN agencies in coordination with the local authorities are covering these needs. The Emergency Appeal is currently being revised and these changes will be reflected. The revised Emergency Appeal will be focused in carrying out roof repairs in coordination with the local authorities.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

**A.2 Summary of current response**

**Overview of Host National Society**

4,225 volunteers are activated, of which 2,533 are from the operations and relief groups carrying out recovery work in the affected regions in sanitation and epidemic control including 531 volunteers working in the protection centres. The Restoring Family Link (RFL) office is working with 168 volunteers at the municipal level, in the 15 provinces and the central headquarters) with 1,161 volunteers

**Overview of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement in the country**

The IFRC continues providing support and coordination with the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) through its Country Cluster Support Team based in Dominican Republic, and through the Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) based in Panama. The Country Cluster Support Team and the regional disaster management coordinator (also emergency shelter focal point) are giving the support to all the response actions of this operation. The sectors and needs addressed by this Emergency Appeal were identified by the CRC in coordination with the government.

The Spanish Red Cross, who has had presence in the country, deployed one staff member to support the National Society’s response efforts. In addition, on the onset of the emergency and on 9 October, two staff members from the Canadian Red Cross Society were deployed to Cuba with the aim to contribute to the response requirements of the Cuban Red Cross.

The Cuban Red Cross coordinated bilaterally with the Spanish Red Cross, through its permanent cooperation program, a shipment of new clothes and footwear for adults, and psycho-pedagogical centres including children without subsidiary protection.

**Movement Coordination**

The Regional Office for the Americas (ARO) has been sharing official information from the CRC with all Movement members. The CRC led coordination meetings at country level with the Spanish Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Society.

At the onset of Hurricane Irma, communication was established with Movement partners to inform of the storm’s path through the Caribbean. Similarly, the necessary information mechanisms were established through the Partnerships and Resource Development (PRD) department.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

**DONETSK FILTER STATION SHELLED BEFORE CEASEFIRE** 

At 16:30 (Kiev time) on Friday 22nd December 2017 Voda Donbasa informed the WASH Cluster about renewed shelling near DFS. Personnel of the filter station stopped chlorine supply with the aim of avoiding a catastrophe if any projectiles or fragments hit chlorine-gas pipework around the site. All employees retreated to the bomb shelter and there is no chance to evacuate staff, due to the dark and absence of any guarantees of Window of Silence (WoS).    

The most recent incident was the third time in the last twenty-four hours, when DFS was under the shelling. Fortunately the first two incidents (December 21 from 14:00 – 15:00 and during the night of 21st / 22nd December 22) both incidents ended without damage to the filter station of staff injury.  

WASH Cluster expressed deepest concern about the continued shelling of the Donetsk Filter station (DFS), to OSCE both in Donetsk and in Kiev, and shortly afterwards shelling thankfully ceased, with full water treatment also restarting.    

DFS supplies water to the following settlements: Avdiivka, Kruta Balka, Vasylivka, Mineralne, Yakovlivka, Verkhniotoretske, part of Yasynuvata and western areas of Donetsk city, and it officially provides water in total to 345,309 people (December 2016 figures from Voda Donbasa).",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

  PRC Chairman and CEO Richard Gordon said staff and volunteers from the 31 chapters in Mindanao and its National Headquarters are currently responding and closely monitoring the situation as Tropical Storm Vinta traverses the country. 

  “When the world no longer watches, the Philippine Red Cross stays to do what must be done. We are one in helping the most vulnerable, banking on our fundamental principle of humanity,” Gordon said.

   He added that the PRC also mobilized 82 staff and 1,955 volunteers from its 24 chapters in the Visayas to help those affected by Tropical Storm Urduja, which made a total of six landfalls on December 16.

  “I would like to commend the families of our staff and volunteers who continuously share their loved ones withus so they can be of service to humanity. This is the true spirit of the holiday season,” he added. 

‘Vinta’ Response

   For Vinta alone, the PRC has so far provided hot meals to 1,880 individuals and psychosocial support to 856people. 

  PRC volunteers were also first to respond when a ceiling of the Butuan City Jail collapsed during the height of Vinta last Friday. 

  Prepositioned non-food items from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for 1,000 families are also ready for distribution at the Philippine Red Cross Chapter in Cagayan de Oro.

‘Urduja’ Response

  Philippine Red Cross teams were among the first on the ground to assess and monitor the situation in the aftermath of Urduja. 

  So far, the Red Cross was able to provide rescue, welfare assistance, first aid management, hot meals, psychosocial support, and relief goods in Urduja-affected communities.

  Some 240 families received sleeping kits, which include blankets, towels, and plastic mats. Food items were also distributed to 651 affected families. Some 8,185individuals were provided with hot meals and 169 people were given psychosocial support.

  It can be recalled that the PRC was among the first to access Biliran province, one of the hardest hit areas by Urduja. The PRC set up a 5,000-liter water bladder at the Biliran Provincial Hospital to provide water regularly to patients and nearby residents, and provided anti-tetanus vaccines to injured individuals. 

   The Philippine Red Cross, as the foremost humanitarian organization in the country, has 103 chapters with two million volunteers nationwide that is always first, always ready and always there to provide round-the-clock humanitarian assistance, especially to the most vulnerable.

 PRC Secretary General Atty. Oscar Palabyab personally received the donation from Chinese Embassy to the Philippines Counsellor Sun Yi at the PRC National Headquarters in Mandaluyong City on Wednesday. 

 “We are very thankful to the Chinese people for your generosity to the Filipinos. Be rest assured that this amount will be properly accounted for and will go far in providing the urgent needs of those suffering from the recent devastating storm in the Visayas,” Palabyab said. 

 A statement released by the Chinese Embassy website said that the “Chinese side looks forward to the aid lending more strength to the disaster relief efforts on the Philippine side to overcome the difficulties caused by tropical storm Urduja, which has hit the Visayas of the Philippines recently, and help the affected people restore their normal livelihood at an earliest date.” 

 Aside from Palabyab, also present to witness the turnover of the donation are: PRC Assistant Secretary General Elizabeth Zavalla, Chinese Embassy to the Philippines Third Secretary of Political Office Liu Tiantian, PRC Fund Generation Director Genna Mijares, and PRC Communications Manager April Ann Abello-Bulanadi. 

 Since last week, the PRC has been working round-the-clock amidst the Christmas season to provide the needed humanitarian assistance to areas affected by Urduja. 

 The PRC recently deployed a humanitarian caravan, consisting of ambulances, water tanker, water bladders, tap stands, water treatment sets and portable generator sets to Biliran province.

 To address the scarcity of clean water in the area, the PRC set up a 5,000-liter water bladder at the Biliran Provincial Hospital. It also provided anti-tetanus vaccines, as well as food and non-food items such as towels, plastic mats and blankets in Biliran. 

 The PRC also set up 13 welfare desks and provided psychosocial support to 169 individuals. Over 60 individuals were also rescued and transported for medical attention.

 The PRC also distributed hot meals to 8,299 individuals in Northern Samar, Ormoc City, Surigao City, Leyte, Masbate, Eastern Samar, and Camarines Norte.

**Major challenges include:**

- The humanitarian crisis in Central African Republic continues to deteriorate in the central region of the country. The seasonal migration of people and livestock to new grazing grounds is expected to trigger increased violence in the centre and northeast regions of the country and with it, even greater need for humanitarian assistance. The insecurity in the region must be urgently addressed to facilitate an effective response by WHO and partners.  

- The outbreak of cholera in South Sudan has markedly decreased as a result of concerted efforts by the national authorities and humanitarian actors.

UNHCR together with government counterparts and partners continued providing assistance to Somali refugees who decided to voluntarily return home. To ensure sustainable reintegration of Somali refugee returnees, UNHCR provides the enhanced return package2 . Detailed achievements throughout November are presented below per sector.

**Protection and Return Support**

**Return Management**

■ The Government of Kenya have now authorized resumption of road convoys to Somalia but due to rainfalls in the region (Dhobley town, Lower Juba region), most of the return routes are not accessible, making return by road not feasible.

■ Flights to Kismayo have resumed on 21 November. The suspension was put in place on 28 September after the State of Jubaland imposed new landing fees on UN flights. The last return flight from Kenya to Kismayo was received on 28 September.

**Protection Monitoring**

■ UNHCR has shared the Country of Origin Information (COI) for the month of October with the Return Help Desk in Refugee Camps in Kenya and Yemen. The COI includes information about the humanitarian, security and political situation in Somalia. The COI helps Somali refugees make an informed decision about their return.

■ During November, the pilot phase of UNHCR’s new post-returns monitoring system commenced across South Central Somalia. Consultations were held with partners in Mogadishu before the rollout of the telephonic monitoring began. The new monitoring system includes a face-to-face survey.

**Return Figures**

Since the beginning of repatriation in 2014, a total of 109,317 Somalis returned to Somalia; 74,606 from Kenya, 34,077 from Yemen (33,667 spontaneous and 418 assisted) and 626 from other countries of asylum (589 from Djibouti, 34 from Eritrea, two from Tunisia, and one from Pakistan).

2391354,"UNHCR welcomes Britain’s support for South Sudanese refugees in Sudan [EN/AR] **Khartoum, Sudan, 21 December 2017** - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today welcomed a multi-year contribution of £7.5 million (approximately US$9.9 million) spread over three years from the Government of the United Kingdom to respond to the critical needs of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan, and those anticipated to arrive between 2018 and 2020.

UNHCR will use the funds to provide life-saving assistance to respond to the vital needs of the South Sudanese refugees as well as host communities in White Nile; West and South Kordofan; and East and South Darfur in the area of protection, water and sanitation, and education. The funds will also allow UNHCR to procure non-food items, such as blankets, sleeping mats and cooking kits, for this vulnerable population. South Sudanese refugees arrive in Sudan in very poor condition, exhausted after long walks to reach the borders and in urgent need of protection, especially children who have lost or been separated from their families during the journey.

Dr. Christopher Pycroft, Head of the Department for International Development in Sudan, said “The unfolding tragedy in South Sudan has had terrible human consequences. The British people stand by those affected by conflict and famine, and commit to continue to support the hundreds of thousands of women and children who have been forced to flee their own country, by providing them with safety, food and water and a roof over their heads. DFID has committed to provide this assistance over three years to help our partner UNHCR, and the other aid agencies involved, to plan ahead and deliver life-saving assistance on the ground more effectively, and to help ensure that children continue to have access to Education even during this time of crisis.”

The UK has been a major donor to UNHCR in Sudan for years, contributing over £ 14.8 million (around US$ 20.8 million) in the past four years. This has enabled UNHCR to assist refugees in the country and has greatly contributed to supporting the South Sudan response since the early days of the crisis.  
Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR’s Representative in Sudan particularly welcomed this multi-year agreement and said: “The United Kingdom has consistently demonstrated its commitment to UNHCR activities to assist the most vulnerable children and people from South Sudan. In an operational context that can change very quickly, this multi-year funding will give more predictability and flexibility to UNHCR to respond more efficiently and at scale when a crisis hits and help respond to expected needs in 2018 as part of our contingency planning”.

To date, close to 453,000 South Sudanese have crossed into Sudan since December 2013, and are now residing across 9 states, in addition with an estimated 350,000 remaining in Sudan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.

Sudan continues to open its borders to refugees seeking safety in the country, which is critical as the conflict in South Sudan is becoming ever more complex in parallel with a worsening food security situation.

**Number of MSF health facilities:** 19 health posts, three primary health centres and four inpatient health facilities

**Number of staff:** 2,258 national and international staff as of the end of November

**Number of patients:** 142,985 patients have been treated at MSF outpatient facilities and 3,117 patients in inpatient facilities between the end of August and the end of November

**Main morbidities:** respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and an increase in diphtheria cases

**Other activities:** water and sanitation (water trucking, hand pump, tube well and latrine installation) and mental health services

We now manage 19 health posts, three primary health centres and four inpatient facilities. Around 2,300 people work for MSF in the Cox’s Bazar district. The main morbidities among patients in our clinics are respiratory tract infections, diarrhoeal diseases and increasing cases of infant malnutrition, which are directly related to the poor living conditions, particularly the state of shelter, water and sanitation in the settlements.

By the end of November, we saw 2,165 cases of measles across all MSF health facilities and more than 77 cases of jaundice.

In addition, the number of suspected diphtheria cases we see at our health facilities has increased. By 21 December, we had treated more than 2,000 patients, most of whom were aged between five and 14 years.

Without an antitoxin, diphtheria can result in a high case-fatality rate. Only a limited quantity arrived in Bangladesh recently.

Active case investigation began in most of the settlements where MSF is working to see if anyone else was sick in the patients’ households. We also collected information about the number of household members and any other contacts the patients had prior to presentation. Contacts are being treated prophylactically with antibiotics via the health facilities. The preparation and establishment of a reserved isolation area for suspected cases are ongoing.

Most of these vaccine-preventable diseases are further examples of how little access the Rohingya population in Myanmar had to routine healthcare. We’ve worked on expanding our isolation capacity for measles and other infectious diseases in most of our facilities.

In response to inpatient capacity needs, we’ve increased the number of beds at our facilities in Kutupalong and our newly-built health facility in Balukhali. We’ve also opened a new 25-bed inpatient facility in the Tasnimarkhola settlement. It’s the only inpatient centre in the area. Another, which was due to open near Moynarghona makeshift settlement, is functioning as a temporary 85-bed diphtheria treatment centre.

In preparation for a potential outbreak of cholera or other diarrhoeal diseases, we have identified sites for diarrhoea treatment units in Balukhali, Hakimpara, Jamtoli, and Unchiprang. Preparations are ongoing.

**MSF project locations in Cox’s Bazar**

**Kutupalong**

More than 547,000 refugees are now living in makeshift settlements in Kutupalong and Balukhali, as well as the expansion site. The MSF Kutupalong health facility has operated since 2009 and is our biggest in Cox’s Bazar. Among the services in this clinic are: a 24-hour emergency room; an outpatient department; an inpatient department, which includes a paediatric and neonatal ward; isolation beds; a diarrhoea treatment ward; sexual and reproductive healthcare services; a mental health department, and basic laboratory services.

Since 25 August, the inpatient department has expanded from 50 to 79 beds to cope with the influx and the increasing numbers of patients. Its isolation capacity was also increased to cope with a potential outbreak of communicable diseases. The outpatient department treats more than 300 patients per day. We plan to rehabilitate the hospital, increase the number of beds and improve the overall infrastructure in the hospital to meet the needs of the growing population. Construction work began in November and will continue through to the new year.

MSF has built and manages three health posts in Kutupalong makeshift settlement expansion area. The health posts treat over 300 patients per day and are located throughout the settlement to provide access to newly arrived refugees.

**Balukhali**

At the end of October, we opened a 40-bed mother and child inpatient facility in Balukhali, near the existing outpatient clinic. In early December, this was converted into a diphtheria treatment centre in response to the rapidly growing outbreak of the disease. We now have 70 beds in the facility for treating diphtheria patients. We also run three health posts in this settlement.

**Balukhali 2**

Since 1 October, MSF has run a health post in Balukhali 2, which has a population of 285, 000. The health provides basic primary healthcare and treated more than 18,100 people between 1 October and 11 December. Newly arrived refugees are being settled in the zone named SS, which includes Balukhali 1 and Balukali 2. On 18 November, MSF opened a health post in the SS zone that treats an average of 170 patients per day.

**Tasnimarkhola**

More than 58,000 refugees live in Tasnimarkhola’s makeshift settlement, formerly known as Burma Para. MSF opened a health post on 26 October and treated 12,400 patients by 11 December. Around 30 per cent of consultations there are for children under five. On 3 December, we started sexual and reproductive health activities (antenatal, postnatal, sexual and gender-based violence, gynaecological consultations and family planning).

On 26 November, we opened a 25-bed inpatient facility. The hospital focuses on paediatrics (children below the age of 15), inpatient treatment of severe acute malnutrition (10 per cent of hospitalised patients) and the management of measles cases (55 per cent of hospitalised patients). To accommodate the high number of measles cases, we had to increase the number of isolation beds to 36. By 11 December we received 320 patients in the emergency room. Of these, 171 (53 per cent) were hospitalised.

We’ve drilled four deep production boreholes to provide water to the health posts and inpatient department.

**Unchiprang**

More than 23,300 refugees live in Unchiprang’s makeshift settlement. MSF runs a primary health centre, which initially opened as health post in mid-September. We provide around-the-clock primary healthcare, sexual and reproductive healthcare and mental health services, with 10 hospitalisation beds. We are the main health-care provider in the settlement and our team carries out more than 150 consultations per day. We’ve opened a second health post in Uchiprang and another in nearby Nayapara and treat 200 cases daily in both.

**Jamtoli**

Jamtoli makeshift settlement has a population of 48,400. The health post MSF opened there in September was later upgraded later to a primary healthcare centre. The clinic currently receives up to 250 patients per day and offers 24-hour primary health care service, with a delivery room and 18 hospitalisation beds. We run two other health posts in Jamtoli.

**Hakimpara**

More than 33,000 refugees live in Hakimpara’s makeshift settlement. The health post we opened there has been upgraded to a primary healthcare centre with 24-hour primary health care services and 14 hospitalisation beds. We treat around 150 patients per day there. We also run two other health posts.

**Moynarghona**

More than 19,500 refugees live in Moynarghona’s makeshift settlement. MSF started a mobile clinic in September, which has since been upgraded to a health post. The clinic sees an average of 200 patients per day. Before the end of the year, we plan to open an inpatient department with a 63- bed capacity outside the settlement. It will offer an emergency room and a paediatric and inpatient therapeutic feeding centre for the Rohingya and host communities. In the meantime, this site has been used as an 85-bed diphtheria treatment centre since 11 December.

**Sabrang entry point**

On 8 October, we started a mobile clinic at the border point in Sabrang, offering nutritional screening and basic healthcare and monitoring. Its services have been integrated into the reception centre’s circuit.

**Other activities**

**Vaccination**

MSF is vaccinating children and pregnant women in its facilities to support the government’s initiative to expand routine vaccination in the camps. Staff at all our health facilities will have the capacity to administer immunisation for measles and rubella, oral polio and tetanus according to national protocols.

From 18 November, the Ministry of Health ran a 12-day measles and rubella vaccination catch-up campaign targeting more than 336,000 children between the age of six months and 15 years. MSF supported this campaign with community mobilisation, site identification, logistics and the transportation of vaccines. A vaccination coverage survey is planned in mid-December to evaluate the success of the campaign.

**Sexual violence**

**Key figures:**

- **Total number of sexual violence cases from 25 August to 3 December:** 113

- **Number of rape cases:** 91

- **Number of sexual and gender-based violence cases under the age of 18:** 37

- **Number of cases of male on male sexual violence:** 0

Since 25 August, we've treated 113 survivors of sexual violence at our sexual and reproductive health unit in Kutupalong. Of these, 33 per cent were under the age of 18, including one under the age of ten.

Estimating the number of survivors is not possible. But sexual violence is often under-reported due to stigma and shame, fear of reprisals, a lack of knowledge about the medical consequences of sexual violence and the need for timely medical care, and a lack of awareness about the medical and psychological support available.

Given these barriers, it is likely that the number of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence MSF has treated so far is just a fraction of reality.

We are starting to see more survivors seeking medical care because some of these women and girls have become pregnant as a result of rape.

MSF has specialised staff on the ground to treat survivors who are referred for treatment as a result of trauma, including sexual assault and rape. Our local community outreach workers visit people living in the settlements and inform them about our free services, which include treatment for sexual violence.

**Water and Sanitation (WASH)**

Beyond our medical response, improving water and sanitation is a major part of our attempts to prevent the spread of disease. According to the WHO[[1]](http://www.msf.org/en/article/bangladesh-crisis-update-%E2%80%93-december-2017#_ftn1), 91 per cent of households and 60 per cent of source samples were contaminated with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Due to the lack of a drainage system, stagnant water is present in 26 per cent of all tube wells. As for sanitation, 39 per cent of emergency latrines installed by WASH partners, mostly at the early stage of the emergency response, are non-functional. The desludging and decommissioning of these latrines remains a priority to improve the inadequate sanitation environment.

MSF is targeting its water and sanitation response in the most difficult to reach areas. So far, we have built 1,247 latrines, 157 water wells and a gravity water supply system in the settlements located in the north and south.

By the end of December, we aim to install 400 boreholes and 1,000 latrines in the Balukhali and Kutupalong makeshift settlements. As the shallow aquifer (the main water source, abundant in quantity and easy to access) is contaminated with fecal coliforms throughout the camps, we started drilling production boreholes between 150 and 200 metres deep to have clean water. To date, four deep boreholes have been drilled.

We plan to start hygiene promotion, clean latrines, educate about hand washing, and distribute soap and other non-food items in MSF facilities. To ensure vulnerable population have clean drinking water, we also plan to distribute water filters in our clinics in Tasnimarkhola and Balukali 2 to patients with malnutrition and measles, and pregnant women. In the southern settlements of Unchiprang and Jamtoli, we aim to build 56 more latrines and 43 wells in the coming weeks.

Our emergency response for new arrivals also includes water supply and sanitation. We have deployed teams to arrival, transit and settlement locations to ensure that newly arrived refugees have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities.

As the settlements continue to expand, refugees have inequitable access to basic needs such as healthcare services, food and water. The military is currently working on a new road but additional improvements and humanitarian services are urgently needed to ensure aid is reaching all those with basic needs and to limit further hardship and the risk of public health problems.

2391134,"Philippines: Tropical Storm Tembin (MDRPH026) DREF operation update  n° 1 **A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

As Tropical Storm Tembin (local name: Vinta), aims to exits Philippine landmass, the trail of destruction it has left is emerging. Latest information indicates that Tembin has caused dozens – potentially hundreds – of fatalities, damaged thousands of houses, washed away vast amounts of livelihoods and disrupted the lives of people mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao Island in the Philippines.  

According to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Tropical Storm Tembin made landfall in Cateel,  Davao Oriental, on Friday 22 December 2017 afternoon packing maximum winds of 90 kilometres per hour (km/h) and gusts of up to 125 km/h. The tropical storm then continued across Mindanao, tracking over the provinces of Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental and Zamboanga del Norte. It weakened before re-intensifying late Saturday, 23 December, and is now threatening southern parts of Palawan. In a bulletin issued at 17:00h local time on Saturday, PAGASA indicated that Tembi was packing maximum winds of 90 km/h and gustiness of up to 115 km/h.  

According to a report issued by the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s – Fifth DROMIC Report on TS Tembin – as of 23 December 2017 morning the following had been recorded:

• 18,177 families or 72,592 persons are affected in 312 barangays in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, and CARAGA   

• A total of 12,768 families or 50,362 persons are currently staying inside 211 evacuation centres in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, CARAGA  

There are reports of widespread flooding as the major rivers breached their banks. There have also been several reports of flash floods and landslides. Initial reports indicate that at least 106 people have lost their lives, i.e. 47 in Zamboanga del Norte, 36 in Lanao del Norte, 18 in Lanao del Sur, and 5 in Bukidnon. Dozen are missing, with the number of fatalities likely to increase. Confirmed numbers are expected in the coming days as the public authorities verify information being received from the affected provinces.  

Government agencies and local responders – including from the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) – are currently undertaking search and rescue operations. Photos shared by rescuers on social media show rampaging, mud-brown floodwaters sweeping down a highway in Lanao del Sur province, engulfing houses and a van, and people seeking refuge on the upper floors of their homes. There are reports of widespread flooding in Cagayan de Oro, one of Mindanao's largest cities, as well as in Zamboanga City. In Davao City, hundreds of families were evacuated their homes on Friday 22 December night as a major Bankerohan river overflowed, flooding several barangays affecting some 31,000 families.  

The situation continues to evolve and more information should emerge in the coming days. What remains clear is that there is a need for a substantial humanitarian response to help meet the immediate needs of affected communities. Already, some of the affected provinces have been placed under a state of calamity, mainly to allow local government units to utilize budget allocations for immediate response.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

**Highlights**

On 22 December, UNHCR evacuated 162 highly vulnerable refugees from Libya directly to Italy, with the strong support of the Italian government which facilitated their transport through an Italian military plane. The group was composed of refugees from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Yemen, who had been detained in Libya, and included unaccompanied children and women. An additional evacuation of 131 refugees from Libya to UNHCR’s Emergency Transit Mechanism in Niger is planned for 23 December, bringing the total number of refugees evacuated from Libya to 396 individuals. Last week,  
UNHCR launched an urgent appeal calling for 1,300 resettlement places to be made available by the end of March 2018 for vulnerable refugees stranded in Libya.

On 17 December, UNHCR international staff visited Gharyan detention centre, located in the Nafusa Mountains (90 km south of Tripoli) for the first time. UNHCR and its partner IMC are currently providing medical assistance in this centre on a daily basis. UNHCR transferred 150 vulnerable refugees from Gharyan to Triq Al Sikka detention centre to prepare for the forthcoming evacuations to Italy and Niger.

**UNHCR Response**

On 19 December, the UNHCR Representative visited the Fallah 1 IDP settlement in Tripoli, which currently hosts more than 250 displaced families from Tawergha. The UNHCR team met with community representatives to assess their most pressing needs. Among these are the lack of drinkable water, a precarious electrical system in the settlement, and the lack of food and basic commodities needed for the winter. In response, on 21 December, UNHCR and its partner LibAid coordinated the distribution of core relief items, including blankets and plastic sheets. In addition, UNHCR plans to implement quick impact projects in this settlement in order to improve the living conditions.

Last week, UNHCR delivered medical supplies to the Libyan national health system. This was the third contribution to the Ministry of Health by UNHCR in the last six months, and will support the treatment of persons in need of medical assistance in various part of Libya.

As of 21 December, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) rescued/intercepted a total of 15,238 refugees and migrants at sea, an increase of 6.3% compared to 2016 (14,332 individuals). On 16 December, the LCG rescued/intercepted 262 individuals, including 64 Eritreans, six Syrian, and two Ethiopians. UNHCR and its partner IMC provided medical assistance, food, blankets and hygiene kits, and identified prevalent vulnerabilities for potential evacuation or resettlement of the concerned individuals.

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)). In 2017, these conditions have led several countries to be on the brink of famine.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"

**The disaster and the Red Cross Red Crescent response to date**  

- 2016/2017: The African continent faces an unprecedented food crisis. Below-average rainfall due to El Nino and La Nina leads to poor crop harvests and limited availability of water. Conflict and violence further reduces the coping capacities of affected populations.  

- February 2017: The United Nations formally declares famine in parts of South Sudan, and reports severe food insecurity in Nigeria and Somalia.  

- April 2017: IFRC launches the Emergency Appeal for Regional Coordination of the Food Crisis in Africa to scale up and support actions in the most affected countries.

2390729,"Suspected cholera cases in Yemen surpass one million, reports UN health agency 22 December 2017 – The total number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has crossed one million, the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) reported today, urging greater efforts to tackle the outbreak and deal with the deteriorating health situation in the war-torn nation.

“The epidemic is not yet over and more concerted efforts need to be deployed to ensure that it is controlled in the immediate term and prevented from reoccurring in the near future,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarevic told a press briefing in Geneva.

Responding to the deadly outbreak in late April, WHO set up treatment centres, provided supplies, trained health workers, and worked with local communities on ways to prevent the disease.

These efforts resulted in tens of thousands of lives being saved.

According to WHO, 99.7 per cent of the people who became sick with suspected cholera and who could access health services survived.

The UN agency continues to support dehydration treatment centres across the country as well as collect stool samples for lab testing, transport them to labs, meet operational costs and make available supplies and reagents.

It also continues surveillance, detection and treatment work.  

**One outbreak after another**  

With its health and sanitation systems in near ruin, Yemen is also now experiencing a rapidly spreading diphtheria outbreak, which has affected 18 of its 22 governorates. About 333 clinically diagnosed cases (mostly in Ibb and Hodeida governorates) have been confirmed.

Diphtheria – a highly-infectious disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria that infects the throat and upper airways, and produces a toxin affecting other organs – can be prevented with vaccines and treated with antitoxins and antibiotics.

But lack of medicines in the country mean the number of cases could rise.

**UN response amid ongoing challenges** 

Responding to this latest outbreak, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) [airlifted](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=58329) some 6 million doses of essential vaccines for children, include inoculations for diphtheria.

WHO has also delivered antibiotics and 1,000 vials of life-saving diphtheria antitoxins to affected governorates.

Similarly, the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) has also upped its response, providing more than 20,000 medical consultations to internally displaced people and other conflict-affected Yemenis via 22 mobile health teams and two permanent health facilities.  

But the fact that the outbreak is occurring amid a complex emergency setting with violent clashes and restrictions of transport of supplies, including medical supplies, means response efforts are extremely difficult.

Underscoring the need for unhindered and sustained access to all areas of Yemen to save lives, the WHO spokesperson asked the Yemeni authorities and all parties to the conflict to facilitate the importation and distribution of medicines and medical supplies, as well as clearances for health partners to reach and treat affected communities.

“If [we] cannot bring in medicines and medical supplies, we cannot save lives,” he stressed.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2390669,"Central America Hashes Out Agenda for Sustainable Use of Water By [Edgardo Ayala](http://www.ipsnews.net/author/edgardo-ayala/)

SAN SALVADOR, Dec 21 2017 (IPS) - The countries of Central America are striving to define a plan to promote the sustainable use of water, a crucial need in a region that is already suffering the impacts of climate change.

This effort has materialised in Central America’s Water Agenda, the draft of which was agreed in November, in Tegucigalpa, by the governments of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, along with the Spanish-speaking Caribbean nation the Dominican Republic.

These countries form part of the Central American Integration System (SICA), the economic and political organisation of Central American countries, since December 1991, where they are working to address the issue of water with a regional and sustainable perspective.

The document is expected to be approved at a regional meeting to be held in February in Santo Domingo, according to Central American officials and experts interviewed by IPS.

“We saw that it was convenient for us to work on a plan, a sort of agenda, that would give expression to the issue of the integral management of the resource,” Salvador Nieto, executive director of the Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD), told IPS.

This is the SICA agency made up of the environment ministers of the eight countries, focused on coordinating efforts to collectively preserve the region’s ecosystems.

And water is a vitally important issue for the 50.6 million Central Americans, especially farmers who have lost their crops due to a lack or excess of rainfall, as a result of climate change.

“All the studies recognise the vulnerability of the region, and point out that the most severe impacts of climate change for Central America will be because of the water issue,” Nieto added.

He said that although reports show that there will be intense storms, they also warn that in the medium term the main problem will be a shortage of water throughout the region.

In 2014, drought caused some 650 million dollars in losses in agriculture, hydroelectric power generation and drinking water, according to the study Situation of Water Resources in Central America: Towards Integrated Management, published in March by the Global Water Partnership (GWP).

However, the region has good water availability, because Central American countries use less than 10 percent of their available resources, points out the August edition of Entre-aguas, a report by the regional office of the GWP, an international network of organisations involved in the question of the management of water resources.

The problem, the report says, is the irregular temporal and geographical distribution of precipitation, and the scarce mechanisms of water storage and regulation.

That limits an optimal and efficient use of water, which leads to basins with problems of water scarcity in the dry season.

The GWP report adds that, due to the high climate variability associated with climate change, the concentration of rainfall in certain regions or in certain periods and droughts in others, affects the quantity and quality of water available.

In 2014, 17 percent of Central America’s total population, some 7.8 million people, did not have drinking water in their homes, according to the World Bank.

In this sense, the Agenda seeks to ensure water availability for present and future generations, but also to establish actions to face extreme climate events.

This situation in Central America, a region constantly affected by climate phenomena, convinced the political elites to take action not only in their countries, but at a regional level.

The GWP has been working with the CCAD to promote the strengthening of governance of water resources in Central America.

“In the region there has been no political instrument to establish a common agenda on water issues, which is why this effort has been made: to generate a space for coordination among the environment ministers, who are responsible for the management of water,” Tábora said, from the GWP regional office in Tegucigalpa.

The Agenda emerges from the effort to establish integrated management of water resources, one of the objectives contained in the CCAD Regional Environmental Framework Strategy, approved in February 2015 by the environment ministers of the region.

This integrated management, from which the Agenda arises, contemplates addressing key areas, such as the promotion of governance systems for the sustainable use of water, which involves actions, for example, to generate and share data and experiences regarding the problems involving water.

“The development of knowledge about water resources is through research, monitoring, or establishing measuring stations and sharing information, a recurrent need in all the countries of Central America,” José Miguel Zeledón, water director in Costa Rica’s Environment and Energy Ministry, told IPS.

He stressed that “we have to make progress in assessing the water situation, because our countries lack information, in order to know what water resources we have, what state they are in and how we can distribute them.”

Another strategic area is the development of instruments for the integrated management of international water bodies, which involves the promotion of a political dialogue at the highest level on protocols, agreements or successful model agreements on the subject.

“The implementation of the Agenda would bring benefits because many communities with water problems are in shared or transboundary basins, and that is why a main focus is to work on the question of international water bodies,” Silvia Larios, an expert on water in El Salvador’s Environment Ministry, told IPS.

Of the river basins in Central America, 23 are transboundary, covering approximately 191,449 square km (37 percent of the Central American territory), and the region has 18 transboundary aquifer systems, according to the GWP.

The GWP also emphasises the importance of promoting technology exchange, as there are communities that cannot be supplied with traditional systems, or cannot properly manage their wastewater, but will have to look for other technical options.

Larios stressed that the Agenda seeks both to reduce conflicts over the use of water resources and to guarantee availability. She also recognises access to water as a human right, to guarantee the supply to communities.

The GWP’s Tábora said that Central America has made progress in water coverage and infrastructure development, but that there is still a gap between rural and urban areas.

“Rural areas continue to be but on the back burner,” she said. Of Central America’s total population, 58 percent lives in urban areas, according to the GWP study.

Also, added Tábora, water quality has been neglected, both in cities and in rural areas.

Addressing the challenges related to water, she said, necessitates an understanding that solutions have inherent political actions, such as the enactment of water laws, given that the resource is linked to economic interests.

To set the Agenda into motion, its operational plan has yet to be implemented, alliances have to be built with various organisations and its funding must be organised and managed by the regional cooperation mechanisms.",4604,"Water Sanitation Hygiene"
2390564,"Fighting Cholera, fighting for Life *Ibb - December, 2017* Adeeba* 42, is from AlMakhadir district, Ibb governorate. She is the head of a family of eight people.

These days, her main problems and challenges are to find food, to be able to eat and to find water to drink, therefore, she does not focus on their quality.

“We were not that much aware about the importance of washing our hands frequently or sterilising water”, explained Adeeba. She added, “we thought that we were immunized and that water couldn’t harm us”. Adeeba mentioned that they did not regularly clean the jerry, “unless we noticed something dirty within it.” Cleaning entailed washing the can out with water only and there was no distinction made regarding how jerry will be use, for drinking or washing.

“[The jerry cans] all seem as clean to us.”

Hazim*, 48, who is living in AlMakhadir has been affected when one of his son was infected by cholera. According to Hazim, the reason is the inability to offer his family the essentail items for a proper and healthy life. He explained the situation by “the finnancial difficulties in the country during the conflict and the collaps of all officially provided services.”

In order to contain and prevent the spread of cholera in affected areas, ACTED partnered with OCHA to implement a dual community and household level emergency response, in order to improve the water supplies and hygiene environments in homes and in health facilities.

ACTED targeted households in Raymah, Al Dhale’e and Ibb communities, reaching 2,500 households with cholera prevention kits, cholera awareness sessions, and water treatment practices training. If a location with a confirmed case of cholera has a population of less than 500 households, ACTED will conduct distributions of cholera kits.

These cholera prevention kits contained a supply of aquatabs, which are tablets of chlorine to be put into water containers, soap, jerry cans, and laundry detergent powder. A single kit is designed to last a household of seven for three months, which enables households to focus on meeting other critical needs.

After receiving the cholera kit and attending hygiene and cholera awareness sessions, Hazim personally followed up with his family. He explained them the processes to wash their hands, to bring water and to store it. He mentioned that bringing water is still the task of women, by tradition and that it is rare to see men doing it. For Hazim, taking care of this process “is the matter of saving life.”

Adeeba also pointed out the hard process of bringing water from well to home, which is the responsibility of women from two to three times per day. The well is 2 kilometers away from their house. In winter, when well water is sometimes inaccessible, they have to go the as far as 5 kilometers to find water.

For Adeeba, the cholera kit helps them a lot, as it contains washing materials that she cannot currently provide for her family on a consistent basis. “The kit means that we will not have to buy cleaning materials for three months,” Adeeba said, adding, “this is a great financial help.”

Distributions of kits were accompanied with pictorial and oral instructions, covering key cholera messages. It explained the proper dosing of Aquatabs, the procedures for safe transport, handling, and storage of water; and focused as well on disinfection of household water storage containers (jerry cans), the risks of contamination via jerry cans or other household water containers and included jerry cans cleaning campaigns. All distributions were also paired with a regular water quality spot checks for free residual chlorine (FRC) at the household level.

Mohsen mentioned that he will make sure that jerry cans are cleaned daily and that the water jerry cans are seprated from washing jerry cans and that they are getting a more specific and more careful treatment.

Moreover, the awarness sessions taught Hazim to not only observe the proper practices for him and his family at home, but to also to be aware of the cleanliness of the environment around his house. “There is no sanitation services and the government services often cannot provide clean water, sanitation, or solid waste management.”

“The distribution of the kit and the cholera prevention awareness session change a lot of my thoughts about what should be and what are the best practice to apply” Mohsen said, adding, “it taught me how thing could be changed when more concerns and acts are applied.”

2393344,"Mine Action and Confidence-Building: Harnessing Trust for Conflict Prevention in Colombia _Adriana Erthal Abdenur, in San Vicente del Caguán, Caquetá, Colombia_

Christmas preparations are in full swing at the church offices in San Vicente del Caguán, in the department of Caquetá.  Groups of children sit cross-legged on the patio, cutting stars out of shiny construction paper and hanging ornaments on the bushes.  In a small meeting room, I sit down to speak with Sonia (not her real name), one of the community leaders for mine action.

Sonia is young, but—like San Vicente as a whole—exhausted by war.  In the early 2000s, San Vicente became the epicenter of a [failed peace process](http://centromemoria.gov.co/proceso-de-paz-del-caguan/)between the FARC and the government, in which the creation of a cease-fire zone allowed the guerrilla to regroup.  To stop the Army operations in the area, the guerrilla planted hundreds of anti-personnel mines around the town and its surrounding fields.  The area remains one of the most intensely contaminated areas of Colombia (itself among the countries with the highest number of landmines and explosive remnants of war, ERW). Coming into San Vicente, I had seen the demining operations by the side of the road, with Army specialists in full protective gear perched tensely over small squares of soil, patiently combing the soil for casings.   My local guide had pointed at the dense overgrowth covering vast fields–fertile land left fallow due to the suspicion there are still landmines.

Since the final agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC was signed, in December 2016, demining efforts have intensified in this part of Colombia, with [the Army and eight agencies](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/municipios-asignados.aspx) working in priority areas.  Yet accidents continue to happen.  The day before my visit with Sonia, a farmer had one of his legs blown off under the knee when he stepped on a mine in a nearby field.  “He was airlifted by the Army,” says Sonia, noting that his community just recently had been identified for mine action.

Sonia recounts the successes, but also mentions the need to build confidence.  The government broadcasts images of villagers playing football matches on decontaminated fields, but in reality the locals won’t step on that land until they have tested it the old-fashioned way: by sending their cattle to graze on it.“  I ask Sonia whether she herself would walk across one of the demined fields. She pauses. “No.”

When asked why, she reminds me that decontaminated land is said to be free of suspicion of mines, rather than free of mines, and that there is still work to be done on build the local population’s confidence in the process. The impact of mines/ERW is predicated not only on the destructive, even lethal capacity of the explosives, but also on the more generalized fear that vital areas may be contaminated, which prevent entire communities from cultivating land, building essential infrastructure, or accessing vital resources. While it takes little effort to spread fear through mines, [substantial investment is required in trust and confidence-building](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12096848) to minimize that fear.

Yet peace process stakeholders and peacebuilders can also leverage this link between mines and trust to create new dialogue spaces, both during peace talks and during their implementation. Demining, in other words, can present unique opportunities for confidence building among warring parties, in part because mine clearance is often needed in order to implement a local ceasefire or other localized actions even during negotiations. In the FARC process, for instance, demining became the first bilateral point in de-escalation, in order to implement a local cease-fire.   Demining thus required that the Colombian military and the FARC guerrillas collaborate directly, setting a precedent for further cooperation.   Demining, in fact, became one of the main topics around which the agreements were organized, and [is the object of an entire agreement](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/acuerdo/Paginas/Acuerdo-sobre-limpieza-y-descontaminacion.aspx).

After the final agreement was signed, in December 2017, humanitarian mine action (HMA) was among the immediate priorities. A body was set up to [issue a strategy](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/Desminado-Humanitario.aspx) and guidelines following international standards, and the Colombian demining oversight body began working with eight demining agencies (as well as the Organization for American States) to survey, map, and demine vast priority areas.

For locals in the countryside—the areas most directly affected by the conflict—one major trust issue relates to the effectiveness of demining, especially when different types of artifacts are buried at different depths. But trust also implies the credibility of institutions, from the agencies to the government bodies overseeing them. In turn, attaining this confidence requires building an ongoing relationship with local actors, at both individual and institutional levels. As in many other contexts, demining agencies working in Colombia carry out non-technical surveys that include consultations with local communities, and that incorporate locals—including women—into their teams.  Demining agencies are also required to establish an _enlace_—a key person that links the agency and the community and that facilitates the flow of information in both directions. When properly established and maintained, these channels allow for the community to voice concerns from beginning to end of process.

Equally important are the level and capacity of community’s own proactive involvement in the process.  In parts of Colombia, local and regional groups have become proactive in mine action, especially in awareness-raising efforts and in identifying demands and concerns.  This participation allows communities to become familiar with the modus operandi of different agencies. Ideally, it can also create communication channels across communities on the demining process, helping to identify challenges and share solutions.

However, there is still work to be done. In this part of Colombia, community leaders complain that there are not enough _enlaces_.  This gap undercuts the exchange of information, which is vital not only to the agencies (which rely in part on popular knowledge to identify mined areas) but also to the communities, who continue to suffer casualties and live in fear even as mine action efforts are undertaken elsewhere.  In some instances, agencies can undermine trust.  Near her hometown, notes Sonia, one agency has divulged who planted the explosives. “This information can reignite resentment among groups,” she notes. “We need to demine without focusing on who did what, otherwise it becomes hard to break the cycle of distrust and resentment.”

Matching agencies to local communities can also be part of this process.  The agreement with the FARC establishes that [ex-combatants also participate in demining](http://caracol.com.co/radio/2017/02/04/nacional/1486166835_366877.html). Sonia assures me that there are communities in Caquetá that in fact would prefer to have the ex-combatants decontaminating their land.  “They know one another,” she says. “And you can’t demine without trust.”

Following the [recommitment to cease fire](https://reliefweb.int/node/2390589), the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations in Donetsk region and a similar number of ceasefire violations in Luhansk region between the evenings of 22 and 23 December compared with the previous reporting period. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations in Donetsk region compared with the previous 24 hours and no ceasefire violations in Luhansk region. The SMM recorded more ceasefire violations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions between the evenings of 24 and 25 December compared with the previous 24 hours, but fewer compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December. The Mission followed up on reports of a civilian injured along the contact line near Berezove and observed damage to residential areas of Pavlopil and Yasynuvata assessed as caused by shelling. The SMM continued monitoring the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske; it recorded a ceasefire violation inside the Stanytsia Luhanska area. The SMM’s access remained restricted in all three areas and elsewhere, including at two “DPR” weapons storage sites. The Mission observed weapons in violation near Poltavka. The SMM visited five border areas beyond government control. In Kyiv, the SMM monitored four gatherings in the city centre.

In Donetsk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 of December, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations[1], including about 200 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 320 explosions). About 40 per cent of these violations, including about 140 explosions, were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December, mostly in the area between government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk) and “DPR”-controlled Debaltseve (58km north-east of Donetsk). Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations, including fewer explosions (18), compared with the previous 24 hours. Between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, although the SMM recorded more ceasefire violations (including 14 explosions) compared with the previous 24 hours, there were significantly fewer ceasefire violations compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, nine projectiles in flight from west to east and two projectiles from east to west, followed by a total of two undetermined explosions and 42 projectiles (42 from west to east and one from east to west), all 1-3km south. In the early hours of 23 December, the same camera recorded three projectiles in flight from east to west, all 1-3km south. On the evening and night of 23-24 December, the camera recorded 12 undetermined explosions 2-4km south-east. It also recorded five undetermined explosions and a projectile in flight from west to east on the evening of 24 December and three projectiles from east to west in the early evening of 25 December, all 1-3km south.

During the day on 23 December, positioned at the railway station in “DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata (16km north-east of Donetsk) for about three hours, the SMM heard 20 bursts and shots of small-arms fire 2-3km west. The same day, positioned on the south-western edge of Yasynuvata, the SMM heard about 50 bursts and shots of small-arms fire 1-3km west.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, the SMM camera at the entry-exit checkpoint in government-controlled Maiorsk (45km north-east of Donetsk) recorded two projectiles in flight from north to south, followed by 25 projectiles from south to north, all 2-4km south-east. In the early hours of 23 December, the same camera recorded, in sequence, an undetermined explosion, three projectiles in flight from east to west and two undetermined explosions, all 2-4km south-east. On the evening and night of 23-24 December, the camera recorded four undetermined explosions 2-4km south-east.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, while in government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk), the SMM heard three undetermined explosions 5-7km south-west and about 40 undetermined explosions and over 240 bursts and shots of heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire, all 3-5km south-east. The SMM heard in the early hours of 23 December 31 undetermined explosions 3-5km south-east; during the day, 14 undetermined explosions and ten bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 5-8km and 47 undetermined explosions and 65 bursts of small-arms fire, all 3-8km south-east; and in the evening, two undetermined explosions 5-6km south-east. During the day on 25 December, the SMM heard three undetermined explosions and small-arms fire 3-5km south-east.

During the day on 23 December, while in “DPR”-controlled Debaltseve (58km north-east of Donetsk), the SMM heard 25 undetermined explosions and 30 bursts of small-arms fire, all 3-5km north-north-west.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, the SMM camera 1km south-west of Shyrokyne (20km east of Mariupol) recorded, in sequence, six projectiles in flight from east to west and eight projectiles from west to east, followed by a total of 11 undetermined explosions and 81 projectiles (67 from east to west and 14 from west to east), all 5-8km north. In the early hours of 23 December, the same camera recorded nine projectiles in flight from east to west, followed by two undetermined explosions, all 5-8km north. On the evening of 23 December, the SMM camera recorded five projectiles in flight from east to west 5-8km north. On the evening of 24 December, the same camera recorded, in sequence, a projectile in flight from west to east, three projectiles from east to west, two undetermined explosions and 39 projectiles from east to west, all 5-8km north. In the early evening of 25 December, the camera recorded five projectiles in flight from east to west, followed by a total of three illumination flares in vertical flight, seven projectiles (five from east to west and two from west to east) and six tracer rounds in flight from east to west, all 5-8km north.                         

In Luhansk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 December, the SMM recorded a similar number of ceasefire violations, but more explosions (six) compared with the previous reporting period (no explosions). Almost all ceasefire violations were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded no ceasefire violations; between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, the SMM recorded an explosion and a shot of small-arms fire.

During the day on 23 December, positioned 1km north-west of “LPR”-controlled Depreradivka (65km west of Luhansk), the SMM heard five undetermined explosions and six bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 5-7km north-west.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the south-western edge of “LPR”-controlled Molodizhne (63km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an undetermined explosion at least 5km south-west.

On 23 December, a “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Oleksandrivka (20km south-west of Donetsk) told the SMM that a senior “DPR” member had issued an “order” to all “DPR”‑members of the armed formations to comply with the recommitment to the ceasefire and not to return fire. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the Joint Centre for Control and Co‑operation (JCCC) in Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk) told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire and that Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the area had also been informed. On 24 December, an armed “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Pikuzy (formerly Kominternove, 23km north of Mariupol) told the SMM that “DPR” members in the area were aware of the recommitment to cease fire. In government-controlled Lebedynske (16km north-east of Mariupol), an officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire.

The SMM followed up on media reports of a civilian casualty. On 23 December, a Ukrainian Armed Forces soldier told the SMM that a man (71 years old) had triggered a booby trap while off the paved surface north of a checkpoint near Berezove (31km south-west of Donetsk) on 21 December. A volunteer paramedic, who said he had been working nearby at the time of the incident, told the SMM that the man had gone into the vegetation off the road when he tripped the booby trap, which had left his chest and left leg penetrated by metal fragments. Medical staff at the hospital in government-controlled Volnovakha (53km south of Donetsk), where the man was taken, showed the SMM X-rays which, according to the staff, showed approximately 15-20 fragments embedded in the man’s left leg, hip, and chest.

The SMM observed damage to civilian properties in residential areas. On 23 December, approximately 250m south-east of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street in government-controlled Pavlopil (26km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed a fresh crater, assessed as caused by an artillery shell (122mm) fired from an east-north-easterly direction. The SMM observed power lines cut about 75m south of the crater and saw a piece of shrapnel consistent with an artillery shell lodged in the outer pane of a south-facing window of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street. A resident of the house told the SMM that she had heard a loud explosion south-east of her home shortly after 22:00 on 22 December and immediately thereafter lost power. A resident of another house on the same street also told the SMM that he had lost power to his house shortly after hearing a loud explosion just after 22:00 on 22 December.

At 55 Karla Marksa Street in Yasynuvata, the SMM saw a fresh crater 3m south of the property’s entrance gate. The SMM saw fresh shrapnel marks on the gate, fence and south-facing wall of the house and assessed the impact as caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. The owner of the property (man in his seventies) told the SMM that the impact that caused the crater had occurred at 21:45 on 20 December.

At 51 Karla Marksa Street, the SMM saw two fresh craters 3m south and 7m north of a house, as well as four south-facing windows shattered and the south-facing walls scarred by shrapnel. The north-facing wall of the house was destroyed. The SMM assessed the wall to have been destroyed by the blast wave of the impact north of the house. The SMM assessed the impact to have been caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. One of the house’s residents (man in his seventies) told the SMM that shelling had started at around 22:00 on 20 December and that he, his wife and two minor grandchildren had been inside the house at the time.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 21 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded a projectile in flight from south to north (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area).

On the evening of 22 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded an explosion assessed as an impact of an artillery round about 4km east (assessed as outside the disengagement area). On the morning of 23 December, positioned on the eastern edge of “LPR”-controlled Pervomaisk (58km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an explosion and saw smoke rising assessed as the detonation of unexploded ordnance (UXO) 500-700m south-west and outside the disengagement area.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge (15km north-east of Luhansk), the SMM heard a shot of small-arms fire 500m north-west, assessed as inside the disengagement area.

During the day on 23 December, positioned near the Stanytsia Luhanska and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 24 December, positioned near all three disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 25 December, positioned near the Zolote and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in a government-controlled area, the SMM observed four multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) (BM-21 Grad, 122mm) near Poltavka (54km north-west of Donetsk) on 23 December.

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, the SMM observed a tank (type unknown) loaded on a flatbed truck in Rubizhne (84km north-west of Luhansk) and a surface-to-air missile system (9K33 Osa) in the outskirts of Klynove (68km north-east of Donetsk) on 25 December.

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw noted ten MLRS (BM-21) were missing for the first time 23 December; it also saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm), five towed mortars (2B9 Vasilek, 82mm) (three for the first time) and seven towed howitzers (2A36 Giatsint-B, 152mm) (all seven for the first time) on 24 December. In non-government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1) and noted a mortar (2B11 Sani, 120mm) and 12 towed mortars (PM-38, 120mm) were again missing.

The SMM revisited a permanent storage site in an area outside government control in Donetsk region, whose location was beyond the respective withdrawal lines, and noted that eight tanks (three T-64 and five T-72) were again missing. The SMM was denied access to another permanent storage site in a “DPR”-controlled area as its gates were locked and no one was present to open them.*

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles (ACV) and anti-aircraft guns[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, the SMM saw five infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (BMP-1) near Popasna (69km west of Luhansk) on 22 December; nine IFVs (BMP-1), an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) mounted to a military-type truck, an ACV (type unknown) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM‑1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna, as well as an APC (BTR-70) and an armoured reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk) on 23 December; ten IFVs (BMP-variants), four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (BRM‑1K), a self-propelled anti-aircraft system (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 23mm) and an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23) near Popasna, as well as a combat engineering vehicle (IMR-2) near Bezhynove (45km north-west of Luhansk) on 24 December; and seven IFVs (BMP-variants) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM 1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna on 25 December.

In non-government-controlled areas, the SMM observed an APC (BTR-70) near Petrivske on 24 December.

The SMM continued to observe the presence of mine hazard signs. At a checkpoint at the southern end of “DPR”-controlled Sakhanka (24km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed that two mines signs had been placed on a concrete barrier which had the message “No Passage” written on it in Russian. Although the concrete barrier was on the road, the SMM observed traffic driving around it. In front of the Ukrainian Armed Forces compound northwest of government-controlled Nadezhdynka (61km west of Donetsk), the SMM saw a 30x50cm rectangular wooden sign with a white background and black painted letters with “Danger Mines” written on it in Ukrainian.

The SMM visited five border areas not under government control. On 23 December, during about 40 minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Verkhnoharasymivka (57km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM saw 14 pedestrians exiting Ukraine and six pedestrians entering. On 23 December, during about 30 minutes at the pedestrian border crossing point near Novoborovytsi (79km south of Luhansk), the SMM observed a pedestrian entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about one hour at a border crossing point near Dovzhanske (84km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM observed 20 cars, four buses and nine pedestrians exiting Ukraine, as well as 20 civilian cars (three with “LPR” plates), a bus, a covered cargo truck and 11 pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about 45 minutes at a border crossing point near Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed a covered cargo truck and five cars (two with “DPR” plates) exiting Ukraine, as well as 19 cars (eight with “DPR” plates), two covered cargo trucks with “DPR” plates and two pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about ten minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Ulianivske (61km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed no pedestrians entering or exiting Ukraine.

In Kyiv, the SMM monitored gatherings in the city centre. On 24 December, between 12:00 and 14:00, the SMM saw up to 1,500 people (men and women, mixed ages) gathered at Independence Square. The gathering was held following a call on social media by an ATO veteran critical of the ongoing protest near the Parliament building. (See SMM Daily Report 19 December 2017.) The SMM saw no more than ten police officers near the square. The SMM also saw three other groups of people chanting slogans critical of the Government, including a group of about 25 men (aged 50-60) among the abovementioned crowd and another group of about 20 men (aged 20-40) near the square, and a third group of 25 people (mostly men, aged 20-60) in Shevchenko Park. The Mission saw the third group had marched from the park to Khreshchatyk Street. All gatherings ended without incidents.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro and Chernivtsi.",12033,"Mine Action"
2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",12033,"Mine Action"
2392204,"Syria Protection Cluster (Turkey): Response Snapshot (as of 30 November 2017) **Response**

The Protection Cluster held  two operational working group meetings to support and strengthen field-level coordination for the ongoing responses in Eastern Ghouta and Northeast Aleppo. Seven members of the Protection Monitoring Task Force conducted 1059 KI interviews in 119 communities, covering 39 sub-districts, 16 districts, in 7 governorates (Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Damascus, Hama, Homs and Idleb). The Cluster released the first quarterly report of the Protection Monitoring Task Force, which is available here in English and Arabic. The report covers data collected through monthly monitoring from March to June 2017. Data was collected by 12 partners in 1,534 key informant interviews conducted in seven governorates, mostly in northern Syria. The Cluster and Sub-Clusters Technical Review Committees finalized both the second standard Humanitarian Fund allocation, awarding $2M to eight projects. The Cluster reviewed and recommended 12 protection (standalone and integrated) projects for the 2018 HRP, with a budget request of $11.4M.

The GBV Sub-Cluster actively engaged in the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) with the technical review, vetting and final approval of 16 GBV stand-alone projects and 10 integrated projects (GBV-CP or GBV-CP-General Protection). The GBV SC coordination team organized a learning session for GBV SC members (group 2) on GBV supervisory structures. The session was attended by 10 participants (9F, 1M) representing 9 organizations. The new GBV SC IMO hosted by Global Communities started work on Nov 1. On 25th Nov, the 16 Days of Activism against GBV campaign took off with a series of activities in Syria, mainly in WGSS  and in Turkey. The GBV SC engaged in advocacy actions with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), on the importance of a multi-sectoral response to GBV and launching the VOICES from Syria 2018 report. The GBV SC also organized a 4Ws refresher training, attended by 29 people (17M, 12W). Finally the GBV SC organized a 10 days training for Case Managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, GBV SOPs, PSS and Case Management. The first part of this took place from 28th Nov to 2nd Dec and was attended by 17 participants (14F, 3M), representing 14 organizations.

The child protection sub-cluster hosted in Gaziantep the yearly WOS CP meet for partners on 23-24 November. In attendance were 58 participants from 43 organizations. Participants had the opportunity to reflect on the 2017 HRP implementation as well as agree on the strategy for 2018. The need to improve inter-hub engagement on issues such as family tracing, was also highlighted. Field test of the Situation Monitoring tool was conducted and data collected and analyzed. 89 KII were conducted in Rural Damascus, Idleb and Aleppo. This was done to test the tool, the questions and process.

15 Mine Action project were approved to be included in 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) after going through the vetting , strategic and technical review process.  Efforts continue to integrate risk education materials within different sectors distributions.

**Gap**

Limited specialized services or inclusive services for other groups with specific needs, e.g. persons with disabilities or older persons, remains a critical gap for the Cluster.

Limited funding for some partners affecting their capacity to scale up response in a timely manner as required.

There is a high need to increased coverage of areas in need. Many areas and IDPs still have not been reached with risk education.

**Plan**

Conduct the final centrality of protection training of 2017. Hold a 4W introductory session for new member organizations.

The 16 Days of Activism will continue until the 10th Dec with activities in Syria, especially in the WGSS and in Turkey. The second part of the 10 days training for GBV case managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, PSS, SOPs and Case Management will be conducted from 4th to 10th Dec. In Dec a CMR specialist from Amman will visit Gaziantep and will meet and train GBV and Health actors. 2 CMR trainings are also planned inside Syria during December. The GBV SC will engage in the consultation process to support the Global GBV AOR in the development of the 2018-2020 Global Strategy.

Finalize the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and key informant interview (KII) survey tool for CP situation and monitoring. Support 5 partners (3 Syrian NGOs, 1 INGO and 1 UN agency) to attend the global Case Management Supervision and Coaching Training in Amman (4 – 8 December).

As of 31 October 2017, the Whole of Syria protection sector, including Child Protection, GBV and Mine Action, has provided 5,708,100 protection interventions across Syria (59% of the 2017 HRP target), 775, 900 of which were reported in October 2017. 37% of these interventions (2,083,600) are people reached through explosive hazards risk education.  

Protection partners have reached 19 out the 30 UN-declared besieged communities and 56 out of the 103 military-encircled areas in 2017*. The ability of protection partners to regularly access those areas and conduct sustained protection activities remains constrained and unpredictable, with 13 besieged communities reached in October 2017 against 17 reached in July 2017. 58% of the total interventions were in 43 sub-districts categorized as severity 5 or 6 in the updated Protection sector severity scale (as of September 2017). 69% of the total response is delivered in four Governorates – Aleppo, Damascus, Homs and Rural Damascus. Gaps in the protection response remain apparent in some locations, in particular Ar-Raqqa (0.32% interventions conducted in this governorate) and Deir-ez-Zor (0.03% of interventions conducted in this governorate). While active hostilities have come to an end in Ar-Raqqa governorate, widespread contamination of explosive hazards and currently limited survey and clearance capacities of mine action humanitarian agencies continue to hamper the response, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas. However, 100% of the response currently delivered in Ar-Raqqa governorate targets hard-to-reach areas, where 68% of the people in need in the governorate are present. A total of 225 communities have been reached through the cross-border actors, with protection monitoring (87% of the 2017 HRP target). The first quarterly report of the Protection Monitoring Task Force (March-June 2017) was shared and contains a series of recommendation for humanitarian actors (available upon request to the Protection sector), demonstrating that protection monitoring is fundamentally linked to programming, by informing all actors of vulnerabilities, risks, protection concerns and other essential information to inform programming of other sectors.",12033,"Mine Action"

(See SMM Daily Report 22 December 2017.)

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 21 December, while on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard a burst of heavy-machine-gun fire and three shots of small-arms fire 2km south (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

During the day on 22 December, positioned in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske for about one hour, the SMM heard eight bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire and ten shots of small-arms fire 1-4km south (assessed as outside the disengagement area), six bursts of small-arms fire 1-2km south (assessed as inside the disengagement area) and an undetermined explosion 4-5km south-south-east (assessed as outside the disengagement area). On the same day, the SMM also heard and saw an undetermined explosion 500-700m south (assessed as outside the disengagement area) and heard two undetermined explosions 1-3km north-west (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

Positioned 2km east of government-controlled Bohdanivka (41km south-west of Donetsk), west of the Petrivske disengagement area, the SMM heard two undetermined explosions, five bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire and three shots of infantry fighting vehicle (BMP-2) cannon (30mm) fire, all 2-5km south-south-east (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

During the day on 22 December, positioned near the Stanytsia Luhanska and Zolote disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in a government-controlled area, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted, on 21 December, eight self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm) on the western edge of Oleksandropil (43km north of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted, on 21 December, 16 towed howitzers (D-20, 152mm) in Novoolenivka (48km north-west of Donetsk), eight tanks (T-64) in Zelene Pole (40km north-west of Donetsk) and seven tanks (T-72) near Kalynove (31km north-west of Donetsk). In non-government-controlled areas, aerial imagery revealed, on 22 December, the presence of 31 tanks (T-64 or T-72) near Kruhlyk (31km south-west of Luhansk), 26 howitzers (17 towed howitzers (D-30 Lyagushka, 122mm) and nine self-propelled howitzers (2S3 Akatsiya, 152mm)), eight mortars (2B11 Sani, 120mm) and 25 tanks (T-64 or T-72) near Myrne (28km south-west of Luhansk).

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In a government-controlled area, beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw four anti-tank guns (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm) for the first time.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles[2] in the security zone. In a government-controlled area, the SMM saw a reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) in Buhas (44km south-west of Donetsk).

The SMM observed demining activities. The SMM saw eight armed “DPR” members with demining prodders and detectors on both sides of a road about 5km north of “DPR”-controlled Petrivske.

The SMM observed long queues at the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge. On 22 December, positioned near an “LPR” checkpoint on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, the SMM saw about 1,000 people queuing to exit government-controlled areas and about 2,000 in the opposite direction.

2390949,"UNICEF expresses sadness over death of a child by explosive device Yangon, 22 December 2017 - UNICEF Myanmar expresses deep sadness and concern over the tragic death of a 12 year-old boy caused by an explosive device in Muse Township, Northern Shan State, on 19th December. The deadly event also injured four other children aged 8, 9, 10 and 11 years who remain in Lashio Township hospital.

“At this tragic moment, our thoughts go to the families. We must do everything to reduce exposure to landmines and explosive remnants of war, and provide the necessary long-term support services to survivors” urged June Kunugi, UNICEF Representative to Myanmar

In at least nine States and Regions of Myanmar, landmines and Explosive Remnant of War (ERW) are left behind from armed conflict or placed intentionally, continuing to cause harm to vulnerable populations, especially children and women.

In 2017, at least eight children have lost their lives and more than 37 have been severely injured from landmines and ERW. Over the past two years, there has been a new victim of landmines, on average, every three days. One out of every three victims is a child.

UNICEF calls on all parties to immediately stop laying new landmines and the Myanmar Government to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty. Addressing the scourge of landmines must also take centre stage in the peace process and national strategies promoting sustainable development.

The Mission followed up on reports of civilian casualties from Yasynuvata. The SMM observed damage to civilian properties in residential areas in Novoluhanske, Dokuchaievsk and Yasynuvata. The Mission continued monitoring the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske; it recorded ceasefire violations near all three. Its access remained restricted in the disengagement areas and elsewhere, including at a checkpoint near Verkhnoshyrokivske and a compound in Luhansk city.* The Mission saw weapons in violation in Sievierodonetsk and near Novotroitske. It observed convoys of trucks marked, “Humanitarian Aid from the Russian Federation”, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The SMM visited four border areas outside of government control.

In Donetsk region, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations[1], including about 190 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 540 explosions).

On the evening and night of 20-21 December, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, four undetermined explosions, three projectiles in flight from east to west and two projectiles from west to east, followed by a total of 38 undetermined explosions, an illumination flare in vertical flight, 157 projectiles (107 from east to west, 45 from west to east and five from north-west to south-east) and 13 tracer rounds in flight from east to west, all 0.5-1.5km south. In the early evening of 21 December, the same camera recorded three undetermined explosions and 19 projectiles in flight from east to west, all 0.5-1.5km south.

During the day on 20 December, positioned on the south-western edge of government-controlled Avdiivka (17km north of Donetsk) for about six hours, the SMM heard 22 undetermined explosions 2-3km south-south-east.

Positioned 1km north of government-controlled Pyshchevyk (25km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM heard seven explosions assessed as outgoing mortar rounds and their subsequent impacts at unknown distances north-north-east.

In Luhansk region the SMM recorded more ceasefire violations, including about 280 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (40 explosions).

On the evening of 20 December, while in “LPR”-controlled Kadiivka (formerly Stakhanov, 50km west of Luhansk), the SMM heard about 30 undetermined explosions 15-17km west-south-west and west, and about 30 undetermined explosions 13-17km north-north-east.

During the day on 21 December, positioned on the northern edge of “LPR”-controlled Sabivka (13km west of Luhansk), the SMM heard about 60 undetermined explosions 5-10km south-south-west.

The SMM followed up on reports of civilian casualties. At a morgue in “DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata (16km north-east of Donetsk), a medical staff member told the SMM that the body of a man (aged 50) had been brought to the morgue at about midnight on 21 December. She said that the man had died as a result of injuries sustained from shelling at his home (at 10 Kvartal 102 Street) in Yasynuvata, adding that shrapnel pieces had been extracted from his stomach. The SMM saw a shrapnel piece and that his name was recorded in a logbook.

At a hospital in Yasynuvata, medical staff told the SMM that a man (aged 67) had been admitted with shrapnel injuries to his right leg at 21:30 on 20 December. The man told the SMM that he had been at home (at 14 Kvartal 103) with his wife when he had heard explosions between 20:00 and 21:00 on 20 December; he added that a shrapnel piece had penetrated the window and hit his right leg. The SMM saw the man’s right leg fixed with bloody bandages.

The same medical staff told the SMM that on 20 December, two women (aged 80 and 56) had been admitted at 21:50 and at 23:25, respectively, and that the former (at 66 Karla Marksa Street) had shrapnel injuries to her legs and a concussion and the latter (at 11 Kvartal 102) with shrapnel injuries to her head, a fracture to her left shoulder and a concussion. The SMM saw them lying down in the hospital.

The SMM followed up on reports of damage to civilian properties in residential areas caused by shelling. The SMM visited impact sites in government-controlled Novoluhanske (53km north-east of Donetsk) (see SMM Daily Report 21 December 2017), “DPR”-controlled Dokuchaievsk (30km south-west of Donetsk) and Yasynuvata.

In Novoluhanske, on 20 December, the SMM saw a fresh crater in a field 40m south-west of the intersection of Michurina and Shchastia Streets, assessed as caused by a round of a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) (BM-21 Grad, 122mm) fired from a south-westerly direction. The crater was located 50m south-west of the nearest house.

At 56 Michurina Street, the SMM saw a burnt house and the south-facing side of the house destroyed. The Mission also saw a hole in the south-east-facing side of the roof, assessed as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon. A female resident of the house told the SMM that she had been outside when the shelling occurred at 17:00 on 18 December. The SMM was unable to assess the direction of fire or the type of weapons used.

At 38 Michurina Street, the SMM saw a fresh hole (1.2m in diameter) in the south-west-facing side of a garage, assessed as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon fired from a south-westernly direction.

At 32 Michurina Street, the SMM saw a scorched car underneath remnants of a destroyed overhead covering adjacent to a house. A male resident (in his seventies) told the SMM that his wife (in her sixties) had been admitted to a hospital in government-controlled Bakhmut (formerly Artemivsk, 67km north of Donetsk) after having sustained injuries on 18 December. On 19 December, the SMM saw a woman with shrapnel injuries at the hospital in Bakhmut, and medical staff there told the Mission that she was a resident of Novoluhanske. (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

At 26 Shchastia Street, the SMM saw that nearly half of the south-west-facing side of a house was destroyed, assessed as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon. The owner of the house told the SMM that shelling had occurred at around 17:00 on 18 December when he and his family had been at home. The SMM was unable to assess the direction of fire.

At 15 Shchastia Street, the SMM saw a fresh crater in the yard of a kindergarten and a fresh hole in the roof, assessed as caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon. The director of the kindergarten told the SMM that 72 children were enrolled and although no one had been there when shelling had occurred at around 17:00 on 18 December, the last child had been taken by his parents just 20 minutes before the shelling. The SMM was unable to assess the direction of fire. On 19 December, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle UAV spotted damage to the roof of the kindergarten. (See SMM Daily Report 21 December 2017.)

At 2 Shkilna Street, the SMM saw two fresh craters in the courtyard of a school, as well as shrapnel damage to one of the courtyard walls, assessed as caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon. The SMM was unable to assess the direction of fire. On 19 December, the same UAV spotted damage to the roof of the school. (See SMM Daily Report 21 December 2017.)

At 25 Shkilna Street, the SMM saw shattered windows and shrapnel damage to the south-west-facing side of a medical facility. The director of the medical facility told the SMM that staff had heard shelling at around 16:30 on 18 December and that some of the medical equipment had been damaged as a result.

In Dokuchaievsk, at 14/38 Nezalezhnosti Ukrainy Street, the SMM saw a broken north-west-facing window on the ground floor of an apartment. Inside the apartment, the SMM saw damage to the corner of a wall in the kitchen, assessed as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon probably fired from a west-north-westerly direction. A male resident (in his twenties) of the apartment told the SMM that he had been in an adjacent room when he had heard an impact in the kitchen, seen the broken window and found a projectile in the kitchen sink at around 12:00 on 19 December.

At 22 Nezalezhnosti Ukrainy Street, the SMM saw holes in the north-west-facing side of a three-storey building. The SMM assessed that the damage had been caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon probably fired from a north-westerly direction. A female worker (in her thirties) in the building told the SMM that shelling had occurred at around 13:00 on 19 December.

At 22/2 Sovetska Street on 21 December, the SMM saw a hole in the west-facing side of a two-storey house, assessed as caused by a round of a 30mm cannon fired from a westerly direction. The SMM also saw a destroyed storage building 10m south of the house. A female resident (in her sixties) told the SMM that she had been at home when she had heard an impact and saw smoke and dust emanating from the roof of the storage building at around 12:00 on 19 December.

In Yasynuvata, at 50 Zavodska Street, the SMM saw a fresh crater in the yard 3m north of a single-storey house, assessed as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon fired from a northerly direction. The SMM also saw shrapnel damage to the north-facing roof, side and gate of the house, as well as shrapnel damage to the ceiling and walls of a room in the northern side of the house. A resident (in his forties) of the house told the SMM that shelling had occurred between 20:30 and 20:50 on 20 December while he, his wife and a 12-year-old daughter had been at home. He said that they had laid on the floor and covered themselves with mattresses until shelling had ended.

At 11 Kvartal 102 Street, the SMM saw a fresh hole in the ceiling of a kitchen in apartment no. 73 on the top floor of a seven-storey residential building as well as shattered north-facing windows. In apartment no. 75 on the top floor of the same building, the SMM saw a fresh hole in the wall at the northern side of the kitchen and shattered north-facing windows through the hole. The SMM assessed that both cases of damage above had been caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon fired from a northerly direction.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 18 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded two tracer rounds in flight from south-east to north-west at unknown distances south-west (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area). On the evening of 19 December, the same camera recorded an undetermined explosion at an unknown distance north-north-west.

On the evening of 20 December, while on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard over 150 undetermined explosions 10km west.

In the early hours of 21 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded two bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 2-3km north-north-east, assessed as outside the disengagement area.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in government-controlled areas, the SMM saw 12 anti-tank guns (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm) near Sievierodonetsk (74km north-west of Luhansk). Aerial imagery on 10 December revealed a probable tank (either T-64 or T-72) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a government-controlled area, aerial imagery on 10 December revealed the presence of two surface-to-air missile systems (9K35 Strela-10 and 9K36) in Donske (57km south of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a non-government-controlled area, the SMM saw three stationary tanks (T-64) in firing positions near Myrne (28km south-west of Luhansk). (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw one surface-to-air missile system (9K31 Strela-1) and eight MLRS (9P138 Grad-1, 122mm), and noted that 15 MLRS (11 BM-21 and four 9P138), one self-propelled howitzer (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm), one surface-to-air missile system (9K35) and 21 anti-tank guns (18 MT-12 and three D-48, 85mm) continued to be absent.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles and an anti-aircraft gun[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, an SMM mini UAV spotted an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) near Chermalyk. Aerial imagery on 10 December revealed the presence of six infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (five BMP-2 and one BMP-1) near Novotroitske.

The SMM observed the removal of a mine at the northern entrance of government-controlled Hnutove (20km north-east of Mariupol). The SMM saw 15 Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel present, two of whom were handling an anti-tank mine (TM-62) and storing it in a tarpaulin bag near a checkpoint. One of them told the SMM that the State Emergency Services had removed the mine from a field earlier that day. The SMM saw a stationary vehicle with “State Emergency Services” written in Ukrainian on the side.

In both Donetsk and Luhansk regions the SMM observed convoys of trucks with “Humanitarian Aid from the Russian Federation” written in Russian on the side. At the south-eastern edge of “LPR”-controlled Luhansk city at 08:55 on 21 December, the SMM saw a convoy of 16 covered white cargo trucks (five with black Russian Federation military licence places and the remainder with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates) on road M04 heading north-west. The convoy was escorted by at least three cars (white in colour with two orange stripes on the sides) with blue flashing lights on, three white-and-blue cars, and an ambulance (some of them with Russian Federation licence plates and the remainder not seen). The SMM saw one of the trucks with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates leave the convoy and heading north-west. Later, the Mission observed the convoy enter a compound at 4A Darhomyzhskoho Street in the southern outskirts of Luhansk city. When the SMM attempted to enter the compound, two armed “LPR” members wearing clothes with “LPR” “police” written in Russian denied its access, claiming that the SMM would not be given access without permission from other “LPR” members.*

At 1 Baumana Street in “DPR”-controlled Donetsk city’s Budonivskyi district (6km south-east of city centre) at around 11:00 on 21 December, the SMM saw five covered white cargo trucks (one with black Russian Federation places and four with white Russian Federation licence plates) parked along the side of the street in front of a storage facility. In the compound, the SMM saw about 20 covered cargo trucks being unloaded. Later that day, at 14:15, the SMM saw a convoy of 28 covered cargo trucks (all with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates), escorted by three cars with black Russian Federation military licence places and a car with “police” written in Russian (with “DPR” plates), on T0507 heading east near “DPR”-controlled Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk).

The SMM visited four border areas outside government control. At the border crossing point near Uspenka, during two hours, the SMM saw 111 cars (39 with “DPR” plates), five vans (one with “DPR” plates), three buses, 81 covered cargo trucks (20 with “DPR” plates) exiting Ukraine, and 71 cars (34 with “DPR” plates), ten vans (four with “DPR” plates), 16 covered cargo trucks (six with “DPR” plates), two fuel trucks and two buses (one with “DPR” plates) entering Ukraine. A woman in her forties near the crossing point told the SMM that between 06:00 and 06:30 on 21 December she saw around 20-25 trucks enter Ukraine, being escorted by “police” cars heading west. A man in his forties told the SMM that he had seen a convoy of around 20 trucks in “DPR”-controlled Kuteinykove (42km south-east from Donetsk), about 35km west-north-west of Uspenka.

At the border crossing point near Marynivka (78km east of Donetsk), during one hour, the SMM saw 14 cars (one with “DPR” plates), two vans and six pedestrians (five men and one woman, aged 40-50) entering Ukraine, and 31 cars (seven with “DPR” plates), three vans (two with “DPR” plates) and four covered cargo trucks exiting Ukraine.

At the border crossing point near Izvaryne (52km south-east of Luhansk), during an hour, the SMM saw 15 cars (two with “LPR” plates), two buses, five covered cargo trucks and 160 pedestrians (94 women and 66 men, aged 35-60) exiting Ukraine, and 22 cars, three buses and 58 pedestrians (39 women and 19 men, aged 35-60) entering Ukraine.

At the border crossing point near Sievernyi (50km southeast of Luhansk), during about 25 minutes, the SMM saw 11 pedestrians (seven women and four men, aged 40-60) entering Ukraine, and two men in their forties exiting Ukraine.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Chernivtsi and Kyiv.",12033,"Mine Action"
2390304,"Nigeria: Humanitarian Dashboard (January - November 2017) **Situation Overview**

The crisis in Nigeria’s north-east is one of the most severe in the world, with 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2017 in the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, out of whom 6.9 million are targeted for assistance. Now in its ninth year, the crisis shows no sign of abating. Insecurity continues to pose major challenges in delivering assistance, especially with the dry season enabling an intensification of hostilities between the Nigerian armed forces and non-state armed groups. Additionally, about 926,000 people remain completely inaccessible to humanitarian organisations. As the year draws to a close, the various sectors of the response are carrying out assessments to refine the planning of programmes for 2018, and carrying out various lessons-learnt exercises to improve the quality of the response moving forward.",12033,"Mine Action"
2390024,"North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, November 2017 **Operational Overview**

The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains severe due to ongoing conflict, continued internal displacement and the unpredictable return of refugees from neighbouring countries. New population movements continued to be recorded in November, with 1,862 new arrivals in Gwoza, followed by 729 in Askira/Uba, 428 in Mafa, 373 in Ngala and 358 in Madagali; Jere and Chibok recorded relatively high numbers of departures. Additionally, recent important and unexpected arrivals of population (over 13,000 persons) were recorded in Nganzai, Konduga and Magumeri where there is very limited partner presence due to insecurity and lack of access. Humanitarian agencies mobilised to address to the most urgent needs, in particular through the rapid response mechanism (RRM), filling the most pressing gaps until sectors can plan and deliver a comprehensive response.  

While food security has improved throughout the north-east in 2017 as a result of a massive scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihoods assistance, the situation remains extremely fragile with many households, particularly in Borno State, mainly dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic food and livelihood needs. Many remain forced to resort to negative coping strategies to access food. The most recent Cadre Harmonisé analysis (finalised in November) projects that, without adequate and timely humanitarian assistance, 3.7 million individuals will be facing critical levels of food insecurity during the 2018 lean season (June through September). The figure does not include four Borno State local government areas (LGAs) where data could not be collected due to access constraints (in Abadam, Guzamala and Marte) or lack of partner capacity (in Kala/Balge).  

In addition to food insecurity, issues of protection continue to cause extremely serious concern throughout the north-east, including person-borne explosive device attacks in or near IDP camps, and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of internally displaced persons (IDPs) by those supposed to protect them, as was reported in Bama (Borno State). In addition, on 1 November, four pupils in a primary school in Kwaya Kusar, Borno State, were gruesomely attacked. Two of them died and the other two were severely wounded. This direct attack against an educational institution, the first one in two years, may impact school attendance as parents may fear for their children’s lives. In addition, following the resurgence of attacks by non-state armed groups in some parts of Adamawa State, 12 primary schools have been closed, affecting education continuity for the children enrolled in those schools.  

The dry season has also allowed the work on ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs to accelerate and, to date, five out of the nine planned hubs are complete (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza). Another four (Monguno, Damasak, Banki and Rann) are expected to be fully operational by early 2018. As these hubs offer secure accommodation and Internet connectivity for aid workers, they are instrumental in supporting effective last-mile aid delivery and enhancing local coordination.  

With close to 70 per cent (US$731 million out of $1.05 billion) of the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) funding requirements received before year-end, the humanitarian response in Nigeria is one of the world’s best funded. Thanks to the generous support of donors, many sectors have been able to meet their targets on key life-saving activities. However, a critical gap remained throughout the year in the funding of the Response and Recovery Planning sector. This has hampered the humanitarian agencies’ ability to deliver comprehensive livelihood support to affected people, has slowed down debris removal activities in major towns, and overall limited early recovery work across north-east Nigeria.  

As the year draws to a close, sectors and humanitarian organisations continued to carry out various programme-based and areabased needs assessments which are contributing to drafting the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan, to be finalised respectively by mid-December and early January.",12033,"Mine Action"
2389274,"NATO trains Iraqi Security Forces to strengthen demining skills In November and December this year, a mobile training team led by Slovakia conducted a training course in manual demining for Iraqi Security Forces. This was held in Iraq in the framework of NATO's training and capacity building activities in support of Iraqi security forces and institutions. It was developed and implemented in coordination with the NATO Core Team in Baghdad.

Twenty-one students from the Ministry of Defence attended the course. Upon completion seventeen of them were certified as instructors; four were awarded with certificates of basic demining.""Most of the students were experienced explosive ordnance disposal personel and were really eager to learn new techniques,"" the Commander of the Slovak Training Team, 2ndLieutenant Lukáš Cabovsky,said.

Following the liberation of Iraq from Da’esh/ISIS, more clearance of explosives is required. ‎Civilians are often the victims, as Da’esh/ISIS are reported to have planted bombs and other explosive devices in heavily populated areas, as well as in schools and parks. To deal with this, NATO is helping to build a sustainable Iraqi demining capacity by conducting a series of training activities for future Iraqi instructors. ""Our contribution is focused exclusively on carrying out training tasks and on providing advice and assistance in support of the Iraqi forces,"" 2nd Lieutenant Cabovsky highlighted.

Other training courses and seminars already conducted in the framework of NATO's training and capacity building activities in support of Iraqi security forces and institutions have focused on countering improvised explosive devices, maintenance of Soviet-era armoured vehicles, military medicine, civil-military cooperation, reform of security institutions, and civil emergency planning to deal with natural emergencies.",12033,"Mine Action"
2388279,"UNICEF Syria Crisis Situation Report (Humanitarian Results) - November 2017 **Highlights**

- As of 18 December 2017, the UNICEF 2017/18 winter response in Syria and Syrian refugee host countries reached over 630,000 children but remains 58% underfunded (out of US$72 million appeal) and 880,000 children remain in dire need for support.

- In Syria, the escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta and limited access of humanitarian deliveries and commercial goods has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, half of them children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since January 2017. In the same month, UNICEF reached more than 340,000 people in hard-to-reach locations (including 27,000 people in besieged locations) with life-saving interventions and critical services in the areas of WASH, education, health and nutrition and child protection.

- In November in Turkey, over 167,000 Syrian refugee children benefitted from the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education (CCTE) for attending school regularly in preceding months, a nearly 22% increase in beneficiaries over the previous payment in September. Approximately 82% of children receiving the CCTE in November also benefitted from the Emergency Social Safety Net programme, which helped reach close to 1.1 million refugees to date.

- In Lebanon, UNICEF WASH response to 190,000 people living in informal settlements (population of 272,000) is facing a critical funding shortage of US$ 26.5 million to sustain services beyond April 2018. To pre-empt the funding shortfall, a shift from full service coverage is being undertaken to mainly focus on the most vulnerable, semi-temporary costeffective water and wastewater facilities, and the establishment of a surveillance mechanism to identify possible communicable disease outbreak and trigger an immediate Health and WASH joint response.

- The number of unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) in Egypt has increased to nearly 2,500 in 2017 compared to 1,800 last year including some Syrian refugees. Key needs identified for this highly vulnerable group include legal documentation, legal support, cash assistance, education and child protection services. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs:** Humanitarian needs remained critical in Syria throughout November. Though the overall level of violence decreased in some areas of the country (primarily those linked to de-escalation zones in southern Syria, northern Homs), violence escalated and or remained high elsewhere such as in Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Raqqa and Deir-Ez-Zour where fighting and anti-ISIL operations continue to inflict high civilian casualties. The escalation of conflict in besieged Eastern Ghouta along with limited access of humanitarian and commercial shipments has led to a rapid deterioration in the conditions of over 390,000 people trapped inside, especially children. A nutrition sector survey conducted in November confirms a fivefold increase in the proportion of children suffering from acute malnutrition since the last survey conducted in January 20171 . 

Furthermore, fighting between armed opposition groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Nour al-Din al-Zenki (NDZ) led to the disruption of humanitarian services in western rural Aleppo. Some humanitarian services were suspended from November 14 to 18 over concerns for the security of staff. Clashes between non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and the Government of Syria resulted in shelling in southern rural Aleppo, triggering a displacement of more than 10,000 residents and 2,600 internally displaced people (IDPs)2 . 

A rise in military clashes led to a displacement of more than 90,000 IDPs from As-Saan, Hamra and Oqierbat in Hama governorate and Tamanah in southern Idleb to move northward into Idleb governorate in the past two months.3 In Raqqa, displaced populations are returning to areas with a high prevalence of unexploded ordinances and landmines. Humanitarian partners estimate more than 200 related trauma cases since cessation of military activities in Raqqa City, particularly among children, highlighting the importance of scalingup life-saving mine risk education in prior active conflict zones. The destruction of education and health4 infrastructure along with further attacks and internal displacement continues to limit access to these essential services for children throughout the country. Subsequently, an estimated 1.7 million children remain out-of-school and 200,000 others have missed-out on basic immunization and polio. 

In total, Jordan now hosts 2.7 million refugees, including 655,588 registered Syrian refugees (51 per cent children)5 . A population of approximately 40,000 Syrians remain along Jordan’s northeast desert border near Rukban, of whom 80 per cent are estimated to be women and children, with a significant percentage of households headed by females. Since the closure of the border in June 2016, only modest support has been possible from the Jordanian side of the berm, including the provision of safe water and access to basic health services, primarily through the UN and in close coordination with the Jordanian Armed Forces. The UNICEF-supported clinic near Rukban has provided around 500 medical consultations in November, a decrease from services provided in the previous month (1,002 consultations) due to limited access. The daily provision of safe water by UNICEF and access to some health services remain the only regular humanitarian assistance available for the vulnerable population at the Berm. 

Reports of minor clashes between Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) armed forces (Peshmerga), Iraq Security Forces (ISF) and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) continued in the reporting month, albeit no significant displacement. As in the previous month, armed conflict remained largely far from Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) areas where Syrian refugees reside. There has been no resolution to ongoing political tension between the KRG in Erbil and the federal Government of Iraq since the referendum on the former’s independence in September, however political dialogue is ongoing. As of November, Iraq is hosting 246,974 registered Syrian refugees including over 107,187 children 6 . Although overall numbers have remained largely static, movements continue between Syria and Iraq at the Peshkhabour border crossing. Per information received from border authorities, some 5,100 Syrians arrived in the KRI in September alone, of these, more than 3,800 were readmittances after prior authorization by border authorities to return to Syria.7 The humanitarian situation of Syrian refugees in Iraq has remained largely the same throughout 2017. With around 40 per cent of Syrian refugees under 18, the need for access to formal education remains high. Although Syrian refugees in camps remain well served, Syrian refugees in host communities may not have regular access to primary healthcare, regular safe water supply or adequate sanitation. In this prolonged refugee crisis, there is need to identify and strengthen community-based child protection networks to identify child protection issues and advocate for child-focused solutions. 

Lebanon continues to host an estimated 1.5 million refugees (over one million registered with UNHCR8 ). The sudden resignation of the Prime Minister Saad Hariri on 4 November heightened the sense of an impending crisis. While the situation normalized with his return to Lebanon, the incident exposed a precarious political context and its potential impact on the region. UNICEF continues to face critical funding shortages in Informal Settlements (US$26.5 million gap) to meet the needs of 190,000 people (estimated population of 272,000) for WASH as well as for Health (US$ 2.8 million gap). Given the expected decrease in humanitarian funding next year, UNICEF is transitioning towards strategic and longer-term systems strengthening in the areas of the No Lost Generation initiatives (child protection, youth, education and social protection) as well as child survival (health and WASH), while maintaining a more durable humanitarian response in light of ongoing needs and current instability.  
In November, nearly 3.4 million Syrian refugees, including over 1.5 million children, were under temporary protection in Turkey. An additional 357,000 refugees were nationals mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, of whom almost 117,000 were children.9 According to the Turkish Coast Guard Command, 2,052 refugees and migrants were rescued or apprehended on their sea journey from Turkey to Greece, almost half of whom were children. The decrease in numbers is most likely related to the deteriorating winter weather, as well as increased border enforcement and monitoring of smuggling routes toward Greece. Under the framework of the EU-Turkey Statement, seven rounds of returns took place for 75 people in November (including two accompanied children)10, bringing the total number of readmissions to 1,469 since the Statement came into effect in March 2016. 

In Egypt, the total number of registered Syrian refugees and asylum seekers has reached over 124,000, an increase from the 117,591 registered in January 2017. Forty per cent of new Syrian arrivals are coming illegally from the Sudanese border leading to an increased number of detentions. UNICEF has access to the 23 detention centres where it provides health assistance, including vaccines, hygiene kits and non-food items, with a focus on young and adolescent girls. 

The Government of Egypt grants Syrian refugee children access to education in public schools under the same rules and regulations that apply to Egyptian nationals. However, absorbing the number of Syrian students in public schools is a persistent constraint due to high class density and limited number of teachers relative to students. Other challenges to enrolment include strict documentation requirements, safety measures (inside and outside classrooms) and lack of quality teaching in public schools. Currently, an estimated 39,000 children remain out-of-school. The number of unaccompanied and separated children has increased to about 2,50011 compared to 1,800 last year. Key needs include issuance of legal documentation to help qualify for legal support and cash assistance, in addition to education, child protection services.",12033,"Mine Action"

The SMM continued to follow up on the withdrawal of Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) from the territory of Ukraine. (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.) Positioned in “DPR”-controlled Oleksandrivka (20km south-west of Donetsk), an “emergency service” member and another unarmed “DPR” member told the SMM that they would undertake the same duties as the previous Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the JCCC. Positioned in government-controlled Bohdanivka (41km south-west of Donetsk), the SMM noted that no JCCC officers were present, only a Ukrainian Armed Forces officer.

The SMM followed up on reports of civilian casualties. At the central hospital in “DPR”-controlled Snizhne (72km east of Donetsk), medical staff told the SMM that on 15 December, a man (aged 67) had been killed after having mishandled an explosive device while at his house at 16/2 Hryboiedova Street in Snizhne. The SMM was shown the medical certificate which described the cause of death as traumatic shock and multiple wounds to internal abdominal organs from a blast. The SMM visited 16/2 Hryboiedova Street in Snizhne and saw a broken kitchen window, shattered glass and a wooden bar blocking off the kitchen door. At 14 Hryboiedova Street, the SMM spoke with the deceased man’s neighbour (a woman in her thirties), who told the SMM she had heard an explosion at around 12:00 on 15 December from the direction of her neighbour’s house and later had seen an ambulance as well as “emergency service” members and “police” arrive at his home.

At the regional clinical hospital in Kharkiv, medical staff told the SMM that a female resident of Novoluhanske (aged 71) had been transferred there from a hospital in government-controlled Bakhmut (formerly Artemivsk, 67km north of Donetsk) on 18 December. Medical staff added that she had lost her right eye due to shrapnel wounds she had sustained; she had undergone an operation and her condition was stable. (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

The SMM followed up on reports of damage to civilian properties in residential areas caused by shelling. On 19 December, in Novoluhanske, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted recent shelling damage to roofs and walls of 36 houses, an apartment block and a public building. The UAV also spotted damage to a kindergarten and to a school: the kindergarten had damage to one side of its roof, where the entry point of a shell was visible, and shattered debris around it while the school had damage to a 4m section of the roof as well as debris in the courtyard. Next to the school, the UAV spotted a fire truck and a truck with an extended telescopic platform which appeared to be working on the school’s roof. The UAV also spotted about 20 fresh craters in the village assessed to have been caused by artillery and mortar rounds: one of the craters was 1m from an agricultural shed and another was seen on the side of a road next to two stationary military-type trucks. Additional armoured combat vehicles (ACV), mines and indications of military-type presence were also spotted in the village (see below). The SMM confirmed civilian casualties from Novoluhanske on 19 December. (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

During the day on 20 December at about 12:30, positioned at the Prince Ihor monument 1km south-east of the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge (15km north-east of Luhansk), the SMM heard an explosion assessed as an outgoing mortar (82mm) round 250m north (assessed as outside the disengagement area). At around the same time, the SMM saw a man in military-style clothes in a firing position on the southern edge of the disengagement area.

While on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard ten shots of heavy-machine-gun fire 5km south (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area).

Positioned 2km east-north-east of Bohdanivka, the SMM heard five undetermined explosions at unknown distances south-south-west and small-arms fire at unknown distances east (all assessed as outside the Petrivske disengagement area).

On the evening of 18 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded an undetermined explosion 4-6km east-north-east and two undetermined explosions 4-9km south-east (all assessed as outside the disengagement area). On 20 December, positioned in Zolote, the SMM saw that the vegetation along both sides of the road leading to Pervomaisk had not been cleared. 

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted, on 13 December, a probable mortar (120mm) 2.6km east of a military camp about 2km north of Travneve. (See SMM Daily Report 7 December 2017.)

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a government-controlled area, the SMM saw a tank (T-72) being transported on a truck near Stepanivka (54km north of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in areas outside of government control, the SMM saw three stationary tanks (T-64) near Myrne and ten stationary tanks near Kruhlyk.

The SMM revisited a permanent storage site in an area outside government control in Luhansk region, whose location was beyond the respective withdrawal lines, and noted that one tank (T-64) was again missing.

The SMM observed ACVs,[3] mines and indications of military presence in the security zone. In an area outside of government control, the SMM saw a military-type engineering vehicle digging a trench (20m long and 2m deep) 5m south of the eastern side of a junction on road T0519 near Vedenske (33km north-east of Mariupol). On the western side of the same junction, the SMM saw two recently excavated firing positions, assessed to be for IFVs.

An SMM mid-range UAV, on 13 December, spotted nine anti-tank mines (TM-62) in a trench on the southern street in Travneve, a stationary military-type truck (GAZ-66) carrying a probable generator parked next to a yard on the main street in the village and a stationary ambulance in the eastern part of the village. Additionally, on 13 December, the SMM heard that a power company had brought two generators to the village. (See SMM Daily Report 15 December 2017.) A series of trenches on the southern street in the village emanating from residential houses and six craters assessed to have been caused by artillery and mortar rounds were spotted. On the road east of Travneve toward Dolomitne (53km north-east of Donetsk), the UAV spotted two trenches, two rows of anti-tank mines (TM-62) (18 mines in total) as well as two rows of probable anti-tanks mines in a field north of the road. Further east along the same road, two sets of new trenches were spotted as well as a crater.

In Dolomitne, on 13 December, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted trenches under the railway tracks, recently dug trenches, vehicle revetments, weapon impacts to the roof of a warehouse building and shelling damage to the roof of another nearby building, all in the southern part of the village. On the road leading north of the village, the UAV spotted two rows of anti-tank mines (TM-62) – one with seven mines and the other with nine – laid across the road, and a total of five mines on either side of the road. At the northern edge of the village, several trenches were spotted cutting across the road, assessed as rendering it impassable for wheeled vehicles. About 300m north of the trenches, the UAV spotted ten anti-tank mines that had been laid across the road and, 300-400m further north, it spotted a trench, a series of tyres forming a roadblock and two IFVs (BMP-1). East of the road block, the UAV spotted an extensive position and, further north along the road, it spotted an IFV (BMP-1), an armoured personnel carrier (APC) (Kozak-variant), several trenches and vehicle revetments.

In “DPR”-controlled Holmivskyi (49km north-east of Donetsk), on 13 December, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted trenches and firing positions north of the village. (See SMM Daily Report 7 December 2017.)

In Novoluhanske, on 19 December, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted trenches, vehicle revetments and firing positions around the perimeter and inside an agricultural area, as well as an IFV (BMP-1). In the village, the UAV spotted an APC (BTR-variant), a reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-variant) and eight military-type trucks and, close to the damaged school (see above), the UAV spotted two APCs (BTR-variant and Saxon) and six military-type trucks (Ural and Kamaz). In a field south-west of Novoluhanske, the UAV spotted at least 56 anti-tank mines.

The SMM visited two border areas outside government control. At the border crossing point near Izvaryne (52km south-east of Luhansk), during one hour, the SMM saw ten cars (two with “LPR” plates), two buses and about 120 pedestrians (60 per cent men, aged 45-65 and 40 per cent women, aged 25-60) exiting Ukraine and three covered cargo trucks, two buses and 60 pedestrians (60 per cent women and 40 per cent men, aged 40-60) entering Ukraine.

At a border crossing point near Voznesenivka (formerly Chervonopartyzansk, 65km south-east of Luhansk), during one hour, the SMM saw 13 cars, two buses and 28 pedestrians (16 men and 12 women, aged 30-70) exiting Ukraine and 25 cars, a bus and four pedestrians (two men and two women, aged 30-35) entering Ukraine.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Dnipro, Chernivtsi and Kyiv.

*Restrictions of SMM’s freedom of movement or other impediments to fulfilment of its mandate

The SMM’s monitoring and freedom of movement are restricted by security hazards and threats, including risks posed by mines, unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other impediments – which vary from day to day. The SMM’s mandate provides for safe and secure access throughout Ukraine. All signatories of the Package of Measures have agreed on the need for this safe and secure access, that restriction of the SMM’s freedom of movement constitutes a violation, and on the need for rapid response to these violations. They have also agreed that the JCCC should contribute to such response and co-ordinate mine clearance. Nonetheless, the armed formations in parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions frequently deny the SMM access to areas adjacent to Ukraine’s border outside control of the Government, citing orders to do so. (See, for example, SMM Daily Report 2 December 2017.) The SMM’s operations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions remained restricted following the fatal incident of 23 April near Pryshyb; these restrictions continued to limit the Mission’s observations.

Denial of access:

Related to disengagement areas and mines/UXO:

The SMM was prevented from accessing secondary roads south of the Zolote disengagement area due to the possible presence of mines and UXO. Armed “LPR” members positioned on the southern side of the Zolote disengagement area told the SMM that no demining had taken place during the previous 24 hours. The SMM did not consider it safe to proceed.
The SMM was prevented from accessing secondary roads in the Zolote disengagement area due to the possible presence of mines and UXO. Ukrainian Armed Forces officers of the JCCC at a checkpoint on the northern side of the Zolote disengagement area told the SMM that no demining had taken place during the previous 24 hours. The SMM did not consider it safe to proceed and informed the JCCC.
The SMM was prevented from accessing parts of the Stanytsia Luhanska disengagement area, with the exception of the main road, due to the possible presence of mines and UXO. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the JCCC told the SMM that no de-mining had taken place during the previous 24 hours. The SMM did not consider it safe to proceed and informed the JCCC.
The SMM could not travel across the bridge in government-controlled Shchastia due to the presence of mines. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the JCCC said there were mines on the road south of the bridge. The SMM informed the JCCC.

2387934,"Adopting Resolution 2394 (2017), Security Council Renews Mandate of Force Monitoring Israel-Syria Disengagement Agreement, Condemns Heavy Weapons Use in Separation Area SC/13135  
SECURITY COUNCIL  
8145TH MEETING (AM) 

The Security Council today renewed the mandate of the United Nations force that monitors the Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights, for a period of six months, until 30 June 2018.

Unanimously adopting resolution 2394 (2017) on the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), the 15‑member body, condemning the use of heavy weapons by Syrian forces and armed groups in the area of separation, again emphasized that there should be no military activity in that area.

The Council welcomed UNDOF’s limited return to its Camp Faouar as well as planning for its return to vacated positions and commencement of limited patrols around the camp, given the provision of adequate protection based on continuous assessment.

It underscored the importance of deployment of capabilities to counter the threat of improvised explosive devices and other technology, as well as addressing civilian staffing needs, to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF personnel and equipment.

The meeting began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 10:10 a.m.

Resolution

The full text of resolution 2394 (2017) reads as follows:

“The Security Council,

“Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be reached,

“Having considered the report of the Secretary‑General on the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) of 6 December 2017 (S/2017/1024) and also reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000,

“Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously observe the ceasefire,

“Concurring with the Secretary‑General’s findings that the ongoing military activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,

“Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement,

“Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other than those of UNDOF,

“Strongly condemning the continued fighting in the area of separation, calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the UNDOF area of operations and to respect international humanitarian law,

“Condemning the use of heavy weapons by both the Syrian armed forces and armed groups in the ongoing Syrian conflict in the area of separation, including the use of tanks by the Syrian armed forces and opposition during clashes,

“Echoing the Secretary‑General’s call upon all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions throughout the country, including in the UNDOF area of operations,

“Reaffirming its readiness to consider listing individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities providing support to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh) or to the Al‑Nusra Front (also known as Jabhat Fateh al‑Sham), including those who are financing, arming, planning, or recruiting for ISIL or the Al‑Nusra Front and all other individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities associated with ISIL and Al-Qaida as listed on the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al‑Qaida Sanctions List, including those participating in or otherwise supporting attacks against UNDOF peacekeepers,

“Recognizing the necessity of efforts to flexibly adjust UNDOF’s posture on a temporary basis to minimize the security risk to UNDOF personnel as UNDOF continues to implement its mandate, while emphasizing that the ultimate goal is for the peacekeepers to return to their positions in UNDOF’s area of operations as soon as practicable,

“Emphasizing the importance of Security Council and troop-contributing countries having access to reports and information related to UNDOF’s current temporary configuration, and reinforcing that such information assists the Security Council with evaluating, mandating, and reviewing UNDOF and with effective consultation with troop‑contributing countries,

“Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, including technology and equipment to enhance its observation of the area of separation and the ceasefire line, and to improve force protection, as appropriate, and recalling that the theft of United Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other assets, and the looting and destruction of United Nations facilities, are unacceptable,

“Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service in an increasingly challenging operating environment, underscoring the important contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to peace and security in the Middle East, welcoming steps taken to enhance the safety and security of UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan, personnel, and stressing the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF and Observer Group Golan personnel,

“Strongly condemning incidents threatening the safety and security of United Nations personnel,

“Expressing its appreciation to UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan, for the efforts made towards a limited return to its headquarters at Camp Faouar and to upgrade and expand its positions on Mount Hermon, including the establishment of new positions,

“Taking note of the Secretary-General’s plan for UNDOF to return to vacated positions on the Bravo side based on a continuous assessment of security in the area of separation and its surroundings, and continued discussion and coordination with the parties,

“Recalls that UNDOF’s deployment and the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement are steps toward a just and durable peace on the basis of Security Council resolution 338 (1973),

“1.   Calls upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its resolution 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973;

“2.   Stresses the obligation on both parties to scrupulously and fully respect the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, calls on the parties to exercise maximum restraint and prevent any breaches of the ceasefire and the area of separation, encourages the parties to take advantage of UNDOF’s liaison function regularly to address issues of mutual concern, as appropriate, and underscores that there should be no military activity of any kind in the area of separation, including military operations by the Syrian Arab Armed Forces;

“3.   Underlines that there should be no military activity of the armed opposition groups in the area of separation, and urges Member States to convey strongly to the Syrian armed opposition groups in UNDOF’s area of operations that UNDOF remains an impartial entity and to halt all activities that endanger United Nations peacekeepers on the ground and to accord the United Nations personnel on the ground the freedom to carry out their mandate safely and securely;

“4.   Calls on all groups other than UNDOF to abandon all UNDOF positions and the Quneitra crossing point, and return the peacekeepers’ vehicles, weapons, and other equipment;

“5.   Calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the operations of UNDOF, to respect its privileges and immunities and to ensure its freedom of movement, as well as the security of and unhindered and immediate access for the United Nations personnel carrying out their mandate, including the unimpeded delivery of UNDOF equipment and the temporary use of alternative ports of entry and departure, as required, to ensure safe and secure troop rotation and resupply activities, in conformity with existing agreements, and urges prompt reporting by the Secretary‑General to the Security Council and troop‑contributing countries of any actions that impede UNDOF’s ability to fulfil its mandate;

“6.   Commends the establishment of a temporary crossing point for UNDOF personnel between the Alpha and Bravo sides for contingency situations, in the absence of the established crossing at Quneitra, and in this regard, calls on the parties to constructively engage with UNDOF, with the understanding that the Quneitra crossing will be re-opened as soon as security conditions permit;

“7.   Welcomes UNDOF’s limited return to Camp Faouar, as well as the cooperation of the parties to facilitate this return, together with continued efforts to plan for UNDOF’s expeditious return to vacated positions in the area of separation, including the commencement of limited patrols around Camp Faouar and the provision of adequate force protection, based on a continuous assessment of security in the area;

“8.   Underscores the importance of progress in the deployment of appropriate technology, including counter-improvised explosive device (IED) capabilities and a sense and warn system, as well as in addressing civilian staffing needs, to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF personnel and equipment, following appropriate consultations with the parties, and notes in this regard that the Secretary‑General’s proposal for such technologies has been delivered to the parties;

2387824,"Landmine conference addresses progress in implementation and the need to universalize the convention as the number of new victims grows Vienna, Geneva - The Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention's Sixteenth Meeting of the States Parties (16MSP) has concluded in Vienna, Austria, recording success in stockpile destruction with Belarus announcing it had destroyed over three million stockpiled landmines bringing to 159 the number of States that no longer have destruction obligations under the Convention. With Belarus' stockpile destruction, the States Parties have now destroyed more than 51 million landmines. In addition, Algeria declared that after more than three decades, it had fulfilled its mine clearance obligation and that had decided not to retain any anti-personnel mines for training, further eliminating these weapons from its territory.  

The Conference expressed concern for the ever growing use of improvised landmines which has driven up the number of casualties to its highest levels since the 1990s. The Conference agreed that more sustained and targeted efforts were needed if the international community is to meet its 2025 mine-free ambition. In addition, the Conference called for sustained assistance to victims of these weapons, especially as the number of victims has increased including a staggering number of children which will require decades of prosthesis and medical care.  

The Conference involved more than 500 participants representing over 100 delegations including 95 States (81 States Parties and 15 that are not yet part of the treaty), and 22 international and non-governmental organisations, including those representing landmine survivors.  

The Meeting was chaired by H.E. Thomas Hajnoczi, Ambassador of Austria and Head of the Austrian Department for Disarmament. The Ambassador, who also led the work of the Convention for the past year, was a key figure of the process that in 1997 led to the adoption and signing of the treaty.

""It is really uplifting to think of the tens of thousands of lives that have been spared thanks to the Convention. When I compare the small number of States that set out to bring about the ban of anti-personnel mines together with the ICBL and ICRC 20 years ago, to where we stand today with 163 States Parties... that is change for a safer and better world. I am grateful that I could be part of it,"" said the Ambassador who is sometimes called ""the Father of the Convention text"" for his participation in creating the treaty.

To commemorate the anniversary, several high-level personalities attended the Meeting including the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize Co-Laureate and former ICBL Coordinator Jody Williams and the President of the ICRC, Peter Maurer. Both organisations were key in the process that concluded in the adoption and signing of the treaty. In addition, the Convention's Special Envoys Princess Astrid of Belgium and Prince Mired of Jordan participated in the Meeting. Following the footsteps of the late Princess Diana of Wales, Prince Harry, through a video message, encouraged the Meeting to action for a landmine-free 2025.

Work of the Conference Clearing of all mined areas

* Thirty-one (31) States Parties are still in the process of clearing mined areas including 12 in Africa, and 7 in Europe.

* One State Party, Afghanistan, has seen an increase in landmine contamination due to non-state actors' use of improvised explosive devices.

* Among the States Parties that must still fulfil their mine clearance obligation are some of the most mine-affected in the world including Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Colombia, Iraq, Serbia, Thailand and Zimbabwe. Some of these countries will require additional technical and financial support if they are to meet the 2025 ambition set by the States Parties.

* The Conference expressed concern that [Ukraine](https://www.apminebanconvention.org/states-parties-to-the-convention/ukraine/) is now in a state of non-compliance and called on Ukraine to submit a request for extension of its mine clearance deadline as soon as possible.

Five States Parties requested and were granted extensions on their mine clearance deadlines under the following conditions,

* Angola which joined in 2002, requested an 8-year extended deadline, the Conference agreed and provided a 31 December 2025 new deadline. Angola said it would require additional US$ 348.4 million to complete clearance and reported that in the last four years, there had been 361 new victims, including 158 children.

* Ecuador which joined in 1999, requested an additional eight years for mine clearance. The Conference granted Ecuador three additional years, until 2022 instead. Ecuador indicated that funding for humanitarian demining operations were interrupted in 2016 after a massive earthquake hit the country. Ecuador's funding for mine clearance is US$ 20,937,735. The Conference requested Ecuador to submit an updated demining plan.

* Iraq which joined the Convention in 2007, requested that a new deadline be granted for 2028 due to new contamination from improvised anti-personnel mines. The Conference granted Iraq's request. Since 2008, Iraq has allotted a total of US$ 249,973,551 to its mine action activities. In total Iraq has demined 551,358,178 square metres. In the process, Iraq destroyed a total of 124,072 anti-personnel mines. Due to the current security situation and fight against the Daesh, Iraq has been unable to survey new contaminated areas.

* Thailand which joined in 1998, requested until October 2023 to clear 305 mined areas. The Conference agreed to provide Thailand until that date to address its mine contamination.

* Zimbabwe ratified the Convention in 1998. A heavily mine-affected country, Zimbabwe has requested various extensions due to financial reasons, and lack of knowledge of true mine contamination. The Conference agreed to extend the deadline until 31 December 2025.

Destroying stockpiles

* After missing its original deadline, Belarus indicated that it had fulfilled its obligation under the Convention destroying all its stocks of anti-personnel mines banned by the Convention. Belarus said it had destroyed over 300,000 mines with TNT filling, and more than 3 million Soviet-era PFM-1 mines, which are extremely hazardous and pose serious technical difficulties to destroy. Belarus achieved this goal through a European Union-funded project.

* Greece has faced a unique challenge since 2014 when a deadly explosion of a Bulgarian destruction facility-where Greece's stocks were being destroyed-halted its efforts. Both countries are in talks to determine safe transfer of these weapons for destruction.

* Ukraine faces a particular challenge in meeting its deadline, as most of the stock it has to destroy is of the PFM-1 type -- mines extremely hazardous and posing serious technical difficulties.

Universal adoption of the Convention * Sri Lanka joined the Convention just days before the meeting and was welcomed by the Conference as the newest State Party. Their accession is important as it will encourage others in a region with low adherence.

* On the last day of the Conference, 21 December, Palestine indicated that it would accede to the Convention.

* 163 States are party to the Convention including the majority of States that have been affected by landmines; all members of the European Union; every State in Sub-Saharan Africa, and every State in the Americas except for Cuba and the United States.

* 34 States have not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention. Combined six of them - China, India, the Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Russia and the United States - may hold tens of millions of stockpiled antipersonnel mines. All of these but South Korea and Russia attended the Convention as Observers and expressed agreement with the Convention's humanitarian objectives. Syria and Myanmar attended but did not address the Conference.  

Next Presidency

The conference elected Afghanistan as the next presidency of the Convention effective immediately following the Meeting and throughout 2018. H.E. will also chair the Convention's Seventeenth Meeting of the States Parties (17MSP) from 26-30 November 2017 at the UN in Geneva, and prior to that, will lead a Pledging Conference on Implementation of the Convention and the Meeting of the Standing Committees both in Geneva.",12033,"Mine Action"

Following the departure of the FARC-EP from Chocó territories, the dynamics of the conflict between the illegal armed groups, paramilitary successors, FARC dissidents and the National Liberation Army (ELN) have changed, due to increased dispute for territorial control. With a lack of effective State presence in the region, confrontations continue to cause breaches of International Humanitarian Law, violation of women’s rights, and the illegal use of land for the exploitation of natural resources.

2387299,"Explosive violence in November 2017 In November 2017, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) recorded 3,617 deaths and injuries from explosive violence around the world, as reported in English-language media. Civilians accounted for 79% (2,864) of the deaths and injuries recorded.

When explosive violence was used in populated areas, 92% of all casualties were civilians, compared to 17% in other areas.

In total, 35% of all civilian casualties from explosive violence last month were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs), whilst 30% were caused by airstrikes, and 10% by ground-launched explosives. However, it is worth noting, that of civilian deaths alone, airstrikes caused the most casualties, responsible for 37% of all such deaths from explosive weapons – IEDs were responsible for 25%.

Attacks using multiple explosive weapon types caused 670 civilian casualties last month. This was predominantly due to the [attack on a mosque](https://aoav.org.uk/2017/2017-worst-year-ied-harm-egypt-last-7-years/) in Sinai, Egypt on November 24th, which killed and injured over 400 civilians, using suicide belts, grenades and guns.

At least one death or injury from explosive violence was recorded in 23 countries and territories last month – two more than in October. The five worst impacted countries were [Syria](https://aoav.org.uk/explosiveviolence/syria/), Egypt, [Iraq](https://aoav.org.uk/explosiveviolence/iraq/), [Yemen](https://aoav.org.uk/explosiveviolence/yemen/) and [Afghanistan](https://aoav.org.uk/explosiveviolence/afghanistan/) according to civilian casualties.

Again, Syria was the worst impacted by explosive weapons. Most civilian casualties (50%) were recorded in Deir Ezzor governorate. Whilst 66% of all civilian casualties from explosive violence in the country were caused by state actors, including Russia, Syria and the US-led coalition.

In comparison, the civilian casualties in Iraq were mostly caused (79%) by IEDs – the remaining 21% were caused by airstrikes. A [suicide car bomb attack on a vegetable market in Tuz Khurmatu](https://aoav.org.uk/2017/suicide-car-bomb-attack-kills-32-northern-iraq/), Kirkuk, killed 32 and injured as many as 80 on November 21st.

Whilst Yemen saw 74% of its civilian casualties caused by air-launched explosives, as Saudi-led coalition airstrikes continued to fall on populated areas, such as homes, hotels and markets.

AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. All actors should stop using explosive weapons with wide-area affects where there is likely to be a high concentration of civilians.",12033,"Mine Action"
2386899,"Ukraine: Checkpoints - Humanitarian Snapshot  (as of 21 December 2017) **Overview**

Crossing the 457-km ‘contact line’ remains challenging for millions of women, men and children moving between the government (GCA) and non-government controlled areas (NGCA) of eastern Ukraine. Despite constant insecurity due to shelling, shooting, and mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination, approximately 1 million individual crossings were recorded in November 2017.

This is a 6 per cent decrease from October 2017. Most of the crossings are people seeking to maintain family ties, access basic goods and services, social benefits and pensions. Specific challenges in November include: the sharp drop in temperatures with the onset of winter and the impact from the reduced winter operating hours of the crossing points (EECPs). Roads are not well lit which also makes people feel unsafe whilst waiting. The facilities at the EECPs remain basic, particularly for the elderly, those with disabilities, children and pregnant women, who wait hours and sometimes days to cross. The facilities are often insufficient for dealing with times of high demand or non-existent in some locations. There is also increasing concern with the high level of mine and ERW contamination along the ‘contact line’ affecting hundreds of thousands of people.

On a positive note, ICRC completed partial reconstruction of the wooden pedestrian bridge at the EECP Stanytsia Luhanska in mid-December. This made the crossing more secure and less dangerous, especially in winter conditions. The pedestrian bridge is the only crossing point between the GCA and NGCA in Luhanska region, with over 8,000 people crossing on a daily basis. Some humanitarian agencies provide humanitarian assistance on both sides of the bridge and maintain first aid and heating points. However, much more is needed to meet the increased needs in this and other 4 official checkpoints that are located in Donetska province. It is hoped that the Zolote crossing point will reopen in the near future to provide car access in the Luhanska region to facilitate the movement of the civilian population.",12033,"Mine Action"
2386724,"1967 - 2017: 50 Years of Occupation - Occupied Palestinian Territory Facts and Figures **INTRODUCTION**

This publication brings together a series of factsheets that were published by OCHA over the course of the past five years, highlighting different issues of humanitarian concern in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The facts and figures have been reviewed and updated for this compilation, which comes on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the start of Israel’s military occupation. 

The occupation is a key driver of humanitarian needs, to which the international community responds. Occupation denies Palestinians control over basic aspects of their daily life and largely determines their ability to move unimpeded within the occupied territory, exit and return, develop large parts of their territory, build on their own land, access natural resources or develop their economy. Some of the restrictions behind these realities have been imposed in response to Palestinian attacks or citing security justifications.

Although occupation is intended to be temporary, Israel increasingly treats parts of the occupied area as its own sovereign territory, seizing lands, intensively exploiting natural resources, establishing permanent communities and altering the demographic composition. These measures have increasingly fragmented the Palestinian territory, isolating communities, rupturing social cohesion, affecting economic activity and depriving Palestinians of many of their human rights.

Under international law, Israel is required to protect the Palestinian population under its control and provide for its welfare and well-being; it must also respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of this population. As affirmed by various authoritative international institutions, from the International Court of Justice to the Security Council, transferring parts of a State’s own civilian population to an occupied territory, unilaterally annexing territory acquired by force, and destroying homes and other property without a legitimate military reason, among other practices, are acts that contravene international law.

In large areas of the West Bank, occupation-related laws, policies and practices have generated pressures on residents, which place them at risk of forcible transfer. Key to this is a restrictive and discriminatory planning regime in Area C and East Jerusalem, which makes it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits, resulting in the demolition, or threat of demolition, of homes, schools and other structures.  

In the Gaza Strip, Israel’s 10-year-long land, air and sea blockade, imposed following the violent takeover of Gaza by Hamas, isolates 2 million Palestinians from the West Bank and the rest of the world.1 The access restrictions, imposed by Israel again citing security justifications, and recurrent rounds of active hostilities, have devastated Gaza’s economy, resulting in more than 40% unemployment, poor access to basic services and aid dependency.

The internal political divide between the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip since 2007, resulted in a split of the Palestinian civil service and increased the hardships for Gaza’s population. A salaries crisis, ongoing since 2014, along with the underfunding of the Gaza-based ministries, the duplication of functions and the lack of clear reporting lines, has undermined the capacity of local institutions to deliver basic services, respond to emergencies and many other key functions. 

Recent measures adopted by the Palestinian Authority have increased electricity blackouts to up to 20 hours a day and impacted the availability of essential services and livelihoods, resulting in a further serious deterioration in living conditions.

Prolonged occupation compounds humanitarian needs and hampers their alleviation, leaving vulnerable households struggling to cope. In 2017, 1.8 million Palestinians are in need of active protection measures provided by the humanitarian community, due to their exposure to conflict and violence, displacement or restricted access to livelihoods and essential services. 

The prolonged occupation, with no end in sight, cultivates a sense of hopelessness and frustration that drives continued conflict and impacts both Palestinians and Israelis. Palestinians possess the skills and resources necessary, if allowed access, to develop self-sustaining livelihoods. Therefore, a political solution that ends the occupation is the single most important priority to reduce humanitarian needs and advance development goals in the occupied Palestinian territory.",12033,"Mine Action"

The SMM continued to follow up on the withdrawal of Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the JCCC from their duties. (See SMM Daily Report 19 December 2017.) On 19 December, SMM monitored the Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the JCCC crossing the contact line at the entry-exit checkpoint in Maiorsk. In Kharkiv region, at the international border crossing point near Hoptivka (33km north of Kharkiv), the SMM observed a total of 75 Russian Federation Armed Forces officers exiting Ukraine. During the same day, while in the city of Horlivka, four men wearing military-style clothes (without visible insignias) approached the SMM and introduced themselves as the “new representatives of the JCCC”. They also told the SMM that they would fulfil the task of the previous JCCC representatives. The SMM saw that the four men were driving the vehicle previously used by the Russian Armed Forces officers of the JCCC in Horlivka. In Dokuchaievsk, the SMM saw a “DPR” member present inside an office previously occupied by the Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the JCCC. The SMM also saw that he was using the same logbook which had been previously used by the JCCC.

The SMM followed up on reports of civilian casualties. On 19 December, at a hospital in Svitlodarsk, the SMM saw a woman (aged 60-70) with bandages on her head and bruises on her face, another woman (aged 60-70) with bandages on her hand and a man (aged 60-70) whose left leg was bandaged, elevated and tied up to stretching bands. Medical staff at the same hospital in Svitlodarsk told the SMM that a total of a man and six women, as well as a child, all residents of government-controlled Novoluhanske (53km north-east of Donetsk), had been admitted there on 18 December. Medical staff added that on the evening of 18 December, three women had been transferred to a hospital in government-controlled Bakhmut (formerly Artemivsk, 67km north of Donetsk) while another had been transferred to a hospital in Kharkiv. Medical staff told the SMM that, at the hospital in Svitlodarsk, two women (aged 60-70) were being treated for shrapnel wounds (one to her head and the other one to her arm); a man (aged 60-70) was also being treated for shrapnel wounds and fractures to his left leg. Medical staff added that the six-year-old child had been in a state of shock when he arrived at the hospital and was discharged on 19 December.

The SMM followed up on the civilian casualties from Novoluhanske at a hospital in Bakhmut, where it saw three women (all aged 60-70): one with shrapnel wounds to her head, one with shrapnel wounds to her shoulder and chest and one with shrapnel wounds to her right shoulder blade. Medical staff in Bakhmut told the SMM that all three women were residents of Novoluhanske had been transferred from a hospital in Svitlodarsk on the evening of 18 December.  

Medical staff at a hospital in “DPR”-controlled Horlivka (39km north-east of Donetsk), where the SMM was following up on allegations of two residents of “DPR”-controlled Holmivskyi (49km north-east of Donetsk) being treated there for shrapnel wounds, refused to provide the SMM with information citing the need for prior authorization from the “mayor” of Horlivka.*   

On 19 December, medical staff at a hospital in Kadiivka told the SMM that three men, all residents of Kadiivka, had been admitted to the hospital on the evening of 18 December.  Medical staff told the SMM that a man (aged 53), a resident of 6a-7 Stakhanova Street, had sustained shrapnel wounds to his left knee while he was in the yard of his house around 21:00 on 18 December. Medical staff told the SMM that a man (aged 27), a resident of 17-a-42 60 Rokiv Zhovtnia Street, had sustained shrapnel wounds to his head while he was outside the building around 21:00 on 18 December. Medical staff told the SMM that a man (aged 68), a resident of 19-1 60 Rokiv Zhovtnia Street, had sustained shrapnel wounds to his left arm, including a fracture to an upper arm bone, while he was at 19-1 60 Rokiv Zhovtnia Street, around 21:00 on 18 December.

The SMM followed up on reports of damage to civilian properties in residential areas caused by shelling. The SMM visited two impact sites in “LPR”-controlled Pervomaisk (58km west of Luhansk) and four in Kadiivka.

At 12 Zavodska Street in Pervomaisk, the SMM saw a fresh crater in an asphalt road. The SMM assessed it as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon fired from a west-north-westerly direction. The SMM also saw four shattered windows and fresh shrapnel damage to the northern side of a four-storey apartment building, located 20m south of the impact site. The SMM saw a military-type compound 600m west of the impact site, but it observed no presence of armed men nearby. Two residents (women, aged 60-70) told the SMM that they heard explosions in the area on 18 December at about 20:10.  

At 13 Potomkina Street in Pervomaisk, the SMM saw a fresh crater in an asphalt road. The SMM assessed that it had been caused by a round of an undetermined weapon fired from a west-north-westerly direction. The SMM also saw two shattered windows and fresh shrapnel damage to the east-facing side of an uninhabited house 6m west of the crater. The SMM saw three shattered windows and fresh shrapnel damage to the west-facing side of another house across the street, 12m east of the impact site. The SMM saw a military-type compound about 1km west of the impact site. The occupant (a man aged 45) of 13 Potomkina Street told the SMM that he was in the yard of his house when he heard explosions in the area in the evening of 18 December.  

In Kadiivka, the SMM saw a fresh crater in a field about 100m south from an apartment building at 4 Kosmichna Street. The SMM assessed that the crater had been caused by an artillery (122mm) round fired from a north-westerly direction. The SMM also observed damage to the south-east facing window and a balcony at 4 Kosmichna Street. Two occupants (men, aged 50-55) of the apartment building at 4 Kosmichna Street told the SMM separately that they heard explosions in the area for about four hours starting at about 20:00 on 18 December.

At 6a Stakhanova Street in Kadiivka, the SMM saw a fresh crater about 30m north-west of an apartment building, as well as shrapnel damage to the north-west facing side of the building. The SMM assessed that it had been caused by an artillery (122mm) round fired from a north-westerly direction.

At 10 Stakhanova Street in Kadiivka, the SMM observed a fresh crater about 10m north of an apartment building which had sustained shrapnel damage to its north-facing wall. The SMM assessed that the damage had been caused by an artillery (122mm) round fired from a north-westerly direction. Two occupants (men, aged 40-50) of an apartment building at 6a Stakhanova Street told the SMM separately that they had heard shelling in the area for about four hours starting at around 20:00 on 18 December.

The SMM saw a fresh crater about 20m north of the apartment building 19 at 60 Rokiv Zhovtnia Street and fresh shrapnel damage to the north- and south-westerly-facing walls of the building. The SMM assessed that the damage had been caused by an artillery (122mm) round fired from a north-westerly direction.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 16 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded, in sequence, two undetermined explosions, 33 tracer rounds in flight from east-south-east to west-north-west, and two undetermined explosions, all at undetermined distances south and south-south-west (the SMM was unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area).

During the day on 19 December, positioned in government-controlled Zolote, the SMM heard an explosion assessed as an artillery round and four explosions assessed as mortar rounds 4-7km south-south-west (assessed as outside the disengagement area). During the same day, positioned north of the Zolote disengagement area, the SMM heard 90 explosions of mortar rounds and 15 bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire, all 7km south and assessed as outside the disengagement area. Positioned at the same location for almost six hours, the SMM saw that the vegetation along both sides of the road leading to Pervomaisk had not been removed.  

During the day on 19 December, positioned 100m north of the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge (15km north-east of Luhansk), the SMM heard an undetermined explosion 3-5km south-west (assessed as outside the disengagement area). While on the eastern edge of Stanytsia Luhanska during the day on 19 December, the SMM heard an undetermined explosion 3-5km south-south-west, assessed as inside the disengagement area.

Positioned near the Petrivske disengagement area on 19 December, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in an area outside of government control, the SMM saw three stationary tanks (T-64) near Myrne.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles[2] in the security zone. In a government-controlled area, the SMM saw a reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) on road M03 near Bakhmut. In areas outside government control, the SMM saw an armoured personnel carrier (BTR-80) and a trench digger near Holubivske, as well as 30 armed “LPR” members close to an “LPR” checkpoint south of the bridge near government-controlled Shchastia (20km north of Luhansk).

The SMM observed mine hazard signs. The SMM saw again at least 20 mine hazard signs (red squares with “Danger Mines” written in Russian) along both sides of road H20 close to a “DPR” checkpoint near Olenivka (23km south-west of Donetsk).",12033,"Mine Action"
2385789,"220,000 children threatened by mines and other explosive weapons in eastern Ukraine - UNICEF *Photos of children affected by the ongoing conflict can be downloaded here: http://uni.cf/2By6IWl*

**GENEVA/KYIV, 21 December 2017** - Eastern Ukraine is now one of the most mine-contaminated places on earth, endangering 220,000 children who live, play and go to and from school in areas littered with landmines, unexploded ordnance and other deadly explosive remnants of war, UNICEF warned today.

""It is unacceptable that places where children could safely play less than four years ago are now riddled with deadly explosives,"" said UNICEF Ukraine Representative Giovanna Barberis. ""All parties to the conflict must immediately end the use of these gruesome weapons that have contaminated communities and put children in constant danger of injury and death.""

Available data from January to November this year show on average one conflict-related child casualty a week along eastern Ukraine's contact line - a 500 kilometre strip of land that divides government and non-government controlled areas and where fighting is most severe.

Landmines, explosive remnants of war (ERW) and unexploded ordnance (UXO) were the leading cause of these child casualties, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all recorded injuries and deaths during the period. Leaving many children with lifelong disabilities.

In most cases, the child casualties occurred when children picked up explosives such as hand grenades and fuses. One child, a 14-year-old boy named Aleksey, recently told UNICEF, ""I picked it up and I think I pressed something, and it just exploded. There was a lot of blood and the fingers were hanging. I was so scared that I started shaking. I almost collapsed.""

Landmines and other explosive weapons also put vital infrastructure such as water, electricity and gas facilities at risk. Earlier this month, a UXO was found at the Donetsk Filter Station which provides water to nearly 350,000 people. Demining groups have been called to the filter station 13 times this year.

UNICEF and partners have reached more than half a million children in eastern Ukraine with Mine Risk Education sessions since 2015. These sessions teach children how to protect themselves from mines, UXO and ERW. UNICEF has also provided psychosocial support to 270,000 children affected by the ongoing conflict.

In 2017, only 46 per cent of UNICEF's emergency appeal to support children and their families in eastern Ukraine was funded. Child protection activities including mine risk education and providing psychosocial support for children had an even larger funding gap of 73 per cent.

UNICEF is calling for all sides of the conflict to recommit to the ceasefire signed in Minsk and allow mine clearance activities and recovery efforts to begin.

2385754,"Prince Harry calls for a Landmine Free 2025 as casualties double *Vienna:* Prince Harry has called for efforts to be redoubled to clear landmines around the world at an annual meeting to review progress on the Mine Ban Treaty in Vienna. At the same time, mine clearance organisations,  The HALO Trust and Mines Advisory Group (MAG) have published a new report, *'State of Play: The Landmine Free 2025 Commitment', *calling for increased action from treaty signatories.

2017 marks 20 years since the adoption of the landmark treaty, which 163 states have now joined, including Sri Lanka, which acceded on December 14.   
Half of these countries have eradicated the blight of landmines. However, according to the latest Landmine Monitor report, casualties from landmines have doubled since 2014, and last year hit their highest mark since 1999.  
Twenty-four people were killed or injured by a landmine or piece of unexploded ordnance *every day *in 2016: of these, 42% were children.

Continuing his support for the Landmine Free 2025 campaign, founded by HALO and MAG, Prince Harry said in a video message broadcast on Tuesday at the conference in Vienna: ""The Mine Ban Treaty includes a commitment from the international community to clear the world of landmines by 2025. With just eight years to go, we must stiffen our resolve and redouble our efforts if we are to stand any chance of achieving this goal. I am delighted that the British Government has taken the lead by increasing its funding to clear these terrible legacies of war, but without similar commitments across the world, the 2025 goal will not be achieved.""

Demining organisations estimate an additional $100m per year is needed until 2025 to finish the job and clear the world of landmines and unexploded ordnance. Responding to newly laid landmines will require additional money. International funding for mine action increased by 22% in 2016 but 70% of this came from just five donor states and 30% was spent in Afghanistan and Iraq alone, meaning funding for many countries actually decreased.

Angola, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe are all lagging behind but could meet the clearance deadline with renewed financial support and political will. Cuts have been felt most in Angola, a country made famous by a visit from Prince Harry's mother Princess Diana in 1997. International funding in Angola has dropped by almost 90% and national budget allocations also dropped by $35 million. Just a few weeks ago, Sapalo, a 14-year-old boy lost both his legs and was left partially blind by a bomb in Moxico province.

James Cowan, CEO of HALO said: ""The overall increase in funding is welcome, however, some of the most mine-affected countries are missing out on landmine clearance because of a misconception that they no longer need help. This poses a dreadful risk to poor and marginalised rural communities who live in daily fear of mines, and to the global efforts to eliminate landmines once and for all.""

Jane Cocking, CEO of MAG said: ""Around the world, more than 60 million people still live in fear of landmines, and last year tragically saw the highest level of casualties in nearly two decades. From the new landmine emergency in the middle east, to the legacy of contamination from wars gone by, these indiscriminate weapons don't only injure and kill innocent people but eliminate land that could be used for farming, schools or hospitals. We have the means and the ability to solve this problem.""

MAG and HALO are working with Prince Harry, donors, and other mine action organisations for a Landmine Free 2025. They aim to reenergise support for landmine clearance and strengthen national and global partnerships.

2385584,"UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, November 2017 **Highlights**

- An earthquake in north-eastern Iraq on 12 November reached 7.3 on the Richter scale. UNICEF provided technical support to needs assessments in affected areas with specific focus on education and WASH.

- A total of 108 school buildings were damaged, six of them badly. UNICEF will deliver 52 temporary learning spaces to affected communities to support continuation of education for over 3,800 students while more comprehensive repairs commence. Immediate WASH needs in affected areas are being met by the government, with UNICEF and WASH partners on standby.

- Water trucking continued in 16 neighbourhoods of West Mosul, filling a water supply gap while repair of the municipal network continues. In November, 109,800 people (half of them children) had continued access to safe water through this intervention.

- In November, there was a decrease in Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) deliveries distributions compared to October, due to the end of military operations in western Anbar, and a decrease in new internal displacements. In total 70,255 individuals received RRM distributions in November.

- Winter response began, and reached 5, 367 children with warm winter clothing, including 787 earthquake-affected children.

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

Military operations to retake the remaining western Anbar districts under the control of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) ended in mid-November. Around 22,000 people have been reported as newly-displaced since the Anbar campaign began in September 20171 .An interagency assessment mission indicated shortage of basic services with drinking water, health care, household items and winter clothing reported as the most pressing humanitarian needs. The total number of displaced has dropped below 3 million people for the first time since 2014. Although over 2.6 million people have returned home, many locations have suffered significant conflict damage, and local authorities may not offer basic services, including water and sanitation, primary healthcare, or education.  

Protection concerns remain for people returning to areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance, and on the voluntary nature of returns. On 12 November, northeast Iraq experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 on the Richter scale, per the United States Geological Survey (USGS), with the epicentre on the Iranian side of the Iran-Iraq border. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) reported nine fatalities and over 550 people injured, with most affected districts being Darbandikhan, Halabja, and Garmiyan. The Darbandikhan Dam on the Diyala River was impacted by landslides that partially blocked the spillway and caused structural damage. Immediate need for shelter and warm clothes were reported, and 108 schools were damaged, at least 16 of them badly.UNICEF participated in joint OCHA-led assessments, and a UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team specialized in natural disasters arrived within four days at the request of the Government of Iraq (GoI). Smaller-scale aftershocks of 4 to 4.5 on the Richter scale continued throughout the month.  
Despite growing international pressure and some concessions offered by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), tensions between the federal Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government have not yet been resolved. Although humanitarian access across KRG and federal internal borders has improved since October, in some areas alternative routes are needed to avoid high-risk areas. Concerns about waterborne disease outbreaks remain high. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF are monitoring and responding with Ministry of Health (MoH),  
Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and relevant ministries.  

**Humanitarian leadership and coordination** 

UNICEF leads the WASH Cluster, co-leads the Education cluster with Save the Children International, leads the Child Protection sub-cluster and Nutrition working group, and is an active member of the Health cluster. UNICEF, UNFPA, and WFP coordinate the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) Consortium serving IDPs, and the Multi-Sector Emergency Package (MSEP), delivering aid in retaken areas. In November, the child protection sub-cluster finalised a ‘Minimum Package for Child Protection in urban newly-retaken locations’. This guidance focuses on a community-based approach, including integration between CP and education. UNICEF, UNHCR, and WHO coordinate with relevant line Ministries through the Cholera Taskforce, led by the MoH.  

**Humanitarian Strategy** 

Humanitarian action complements recovery and stabilization activities by enhancing preparedness and response capacity of State institutions and local actors. Under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), strategic priorities are to: reach as many people in need as possible across Iraq by securing safe access to front-line and newly retaken areas; facilitate and advocate for voluntary, safe, and dignified returns; give options to families to live in Iraq in dignity by expanding resilience and social cohesion programmes; and help people affected by violence recover by providing specialized protection assistance. In support of the national response, humanitarian partners are expected to simultaneously respond to both mass displacement and mass returns. The development of the Iraq 2018 HRP is ongoing. With the 2018 Cluster strategies finalised, partners’ projects are submitted to Clusters, and will be reviewed in early December, after which cluster portfolios will be presented to the HRP Advisory Board.",12033,"Mine Action"
2385344,"European Union increases support for the anti-personnel mine ban convention  calls on those using landmines to cease their use Vienna, Brussels, Geneva – The European Union (EU) has announced additional support to help countries implement their obligations under the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention which bans the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of these weapons. 

The EU reaffirmed its strong support for the Convention during the Sixteenth Meeting of the States Parties of the Convention taking place in Vienna. Over 400 representatives of government, international and non-governmental organisations are meeting at UN Vienna to address the implementation of the landmark disarmament and humanitarian treaty signed this December 20 years ago. 

“The EU condemns the use of anti-personnel mines by any actor, whether States or non-state actors. We also appeal to all States not party to the Convention and non-state actors to stop manufacturing, trading and using these weapons,” said Jacek Bylica, the EU’s Special Envoy for Disarmament and Non-proliferation during the meeting. “Particularly worrying is the use of improvised anti-personnel mines in the context of urban warfare, specifically aimed at terrorising civilians and hindering the return of internally displaced persons and refugees. This is a key driver in forcing people to leave their homes and a major factor behind the current refugee crisis,” added Jacek Bylica. 

“The use of improvised anti-personnel mines has created new large-scale contamination in Iraq, a State Party to the Convention, and Libya and Syria, which have not yet joined. The use of these improvised mines has resulted in a reversal of the downward trend in the number of global mine casualties for the second year in a row since the entry into force of the Convention. The new threats must be addressed with determination, without distracting attention from the vast areas across the world that remain inaccessible due to legacy mine contamination,” said the EU Envoy, meaning countries like Angola, Cambodia and Zimbabwe which are still suffering the effects of landmines planted decades ago. 

“Their impact continues to disproportionately affect rural communities, usually some of the poorest, as well as minorities and marginalised groups. They should not be forgotten. In light of these developments, it is necessary to reaffirm our commitment with regard to international cooperation and assistance, as the obligation to rid the world of anti-personnel mines is a collective effort by all States Parties.” 

**European Union financial assistance to mine action**

The EU and its Member States are one of the world’s largest donors for humanitarian mine action. EU assistance includes mine clearance, risk education, victim assistance, stockpile destruction, and benefits nearly all heavily affected countries, including Chad, Colombia, Croatia, Iraq, Lao PDR, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, Syria and Ukraine. 

In the 2012-2016 period the EU through its institutions and Member States, committed over €600 million to address the threat of mines and explosive remnants of war in conflict-affected countries. 

Some States Parties to the Convention however, need additional capacity-building support to identify and overcome remaining challenges if they are to fulfil their ambition of a mine-free world by 2025. 

The European Union through a Council Decision will allocate an additional €2.3 million to promote the universal adherence to the treaty including through the Convention’s Special Envoys Prince Mired of Jordan and Princess Astrid of Belgium. Other projects under the Council Decision will help States Parties to implement their mine clearance, stockpile destruction and victim assistance commitments under the 2014 Maputo Action Plan of the Convention. 

“The Decision will facilitate national stakeholder meetings in mine-affected countries with relevant authorities, international and non-governmental organisations, donors and mine-affected communities. In the spirit of partnership embedded in the Convention, the implementation of this Decision will include the participation of the 1997 Nobel Peace Co-Laureate the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other relevant UN and international organisations,” said Jacek Bylica. 

**The Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention**

The Convention was adopted in Oslo and signed in Ottawa in December 1997. To date, there are 163 States Parties – just last week, heavily mine-affected Sri Lanka joined the treaty. Together, the Parties have destroyed over 51 million landmines, and liberated millions of hectares of once contaminated land. To date, 30 States have declared being mine free, while 31 continue to implement their mine clearance obligation. 29 States Parties have declared responsibility for a large number – hundreds or thousands – of landmine survivors, including some of the poorest in the world and face significant challenges in fulfilling their responsibilities.",12033,"Mine Action"
2385194,"Occupied Palestinian Territory: Humanitarian Needs Overview 2018, November 2017 OVERVIEW 

The humanitarian context of the oPt is unique amongst today’s crises and remains directly tied to the impact of the occupation, which marked its 50th year in June 2017. A protracted protection crisis continues. At least 1.9 million Palestinians experience, or are at risk of, conflict and violence, displacement and denial of access to livelihoods, among other threats. The most vulnerable Palestinians are currently denied or restricted in their access to essential services such as water and health care. A recurrent cycle of shocks, natural and manmade, has eroded the resilience of vulnerable households to cope with the prolonged nature of the humanitarian crisis. 

These dynamics are significantly magnified in the Gaza context by the protracted blockade, imposed by Israel citing security concerns after the takeover of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, three major escalations of hostilities in less than ten years and the intensification of the internal divide between the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) and the de facto Hamas authorities during the course of 2017. Combined, these factors have devastated public infrastructure, disrupted the delivery of basic services and undermined already vulnerable living conditions. Across the oPt, one in two Palestinians, or roughly two and a half million people, will need some form of humanitarian assistance in 2018.

GAZA STRIP 

The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip deteriorated markedly in 2017 due to an escalation in the internal Palestinian political divide, following the decision in March by the de facto Hamas leadership to establish a parallel structure to run local ministries in Gaza.In response, the PA reduced payments for electricity, the allowances of public employees, and payments for the referral of patients for treatment outside Gaza. Longer power outages have negatively impacted basic health and water and sanitation services and limited the ability of farmers to irrigate their lands, further undermining food security and livelihoods. Following Egyptian mediation, the two sides reached an agreement in October 2017, which envisages the PA resuming control of the Gaza crossings, as a necessary first step towards alleviating the humanitarian situation and achieving the goal of Palestinian unity under a single, democratic and legitimate national authority. The measures put in place in Gaza in 2017 by the PA had yet to be reversed at the time of preparation of the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO).

The magnitude of the challenges facing Gaza is underlined in a recent United Nations report projecting the situation of Gaza in the year 2020. The study revisited key indicators first published in 2012, and found “that most of the projections for 2020 have in fact deteriorated even further and faster than anticipated” with the population increasing and the economy and basic infrastructure and services deteriorating, and “simply unable to keep up with demand.” Real GDP growth in Gaza has slowed to only 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, while the unemployment rate for the second quarter rose to 44 per cent. Unemployment among those aged between 15 and 29 has reached a “staggering” 62 per cent. According to The Economist, “In real terms, Gazans are about 25 per cent poorer today than they were at the time of the Oslo Accords.” The standard of living in Gaza, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person of $1,700 a year in 2015, is comparable to Congo-Brazzaville; the West Bank figure, $3,700 a year, is similar to Egypt; while Israel, $35,000 a year, is “much the same as France”.

The August 2014 ceasefire continues to hold, with a relatively low number of Palestinian fatalities (17) and injuries (221) by Israeli forces as of November 2017, and no further conflict-related displacement recorded.  Approximately 23,500 people still remain displaced from the 2014 conflict, as of November 2017. The Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has played a key role in facilitating increased imports of construction materials; however, it has been less successful in facilitating the import of dual use materials beyond cement and re-bar, also critical for public works projects.  
As of November 2017, 5,755 out of the 11,000 totally destroyed housing units have been reconstructed and work on an additional 818 is underway. Insufficient funding is the primary obstacle to completing the remaining residential reconstruction projects.

Most of the two million Palestinians in Gaza remain unable to access the remainder of the oPt and the outside world, with only a minority eligible for exit permits via Israel, primarily patients, business people and the staff of international organizations. Although the number of Palestinian exits increased after the 2014 hostilities, figures have declined significantly again since the second half of 2016, with the figure for November 2017 some 47 per cent below the 2016 average. While there has been a gradual increase in the absolute number of medical patients allowed through the Israeli-controlled Erez crossing, the approval rate has also been declining, at 55 per cent in October compared to 93 per cent in 2012. While the number of approved permit applications for United Nations national staff to leave Gaza increased by 19.7 per cent from the second half of 2016 to the first half of 2017, the Israeli authorities have significantly increased the time necessary for processing permits, from 26 to 55 working days, impeding humanitarian operations.  
Movement constraints have been compounded by the protracted closure of the Rafah terminal, which has only partially opened for 29 days in 2017, allowing 1,222 patients to exit for medical treatment.

**Protection** 

Although the 2014 ceasefire has held, the ongoing restrictions on the movement of people and goods and the threat of a new round of hostilities are major protection concerns for Palestinians in Gaza. These concerns are exacerbated by the rising hopelessness and deterioration in the humanitarian situation, as well as by the shooting of rockets at Israel and the digging of attack tunnels, among other factors. The risk of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) remains and high levels of psychosocial distress are reported across the population, particularly among children, leaving them with a deep sense of insecurity, fear and hopelessness. The protracted humanitarian crisis has also exacerbated genderbased-violence (GBV) in all its forms, including sexual violence, domestic violence and child marriage. The Protection Cluster continues to identify accountability for violations during the Gaza hostilities in 2014, by all sides, and for violations during the daily enforcement of restrictions in the Access Restricted Areas (ARAs) as an urgent priority. 

**Displacement**

No new displacement was recorded in Gaza in 2017. The GRM has provided access to vital construction materials, but as of November 2017 funding is lacking for the reconstruction of about 3,800 destroyed and over 56,500 damaged housing units from the 2014 round of hostilities. Displacement continues for 23,500 people who are primarily reliant on temporary shelter cash assistance (TSCA) to rent accommodation until their homes are reconstructed or rehabilitated. TSCA been disrupted due to significant funding shortages with anecdotal evidence suggesting that this has resulted in debt accumulation and the adoption of negative coping mechanisms such as withdrawing children from school or engaging children in income generation.10 Some 4,500 families who have not yet received assistance to repair conflict-related damages are in urgent need of support due to continued exposure to the elements, high vulnerability and lack of resources. In addition, 8,100 families are at risk of exposure due to inadequate protection against the natural elements.  

**Access to essential services** 

The provision of basic services in Gaza remains a key humanitarian concern. Increasing electricity cuts are undermining basic services already depleted by the blockade, recurrent hostilities and restrictions on the import of goods considered “dual use”. Surgeries are being delayed, some diagnostic services are being put on hold, and there has been a disruption in the delivery of primary healthcare (PHC) and secondary healthcare (SHC) services by the Ministry of Health (MoH). Health provision is also impeded by delays in the shipment of essential drugs and disposables from the PA Ministry of Health, which has also recently been delaying or suspending payment for the referral of patients for medical treatment outside Gaza. The number of permit applications denied or delayed by Israel to access health care outside Gaza has also been on the increase, reaching 45 per cent of applications in October 2017.  

The blockade and escalations in hostilities have also resulted in repeated damage and the destruction of infrastructure, the deaths of students and teachers and psychosocial stress among children and teachers. Increasing electricity shortages are affecting children’s right and ability to access education at school and at home, restricting study time and their ability to concentrate.  
Some 70 per cent of UNRWA schools and over 63 per cent of Ministry of Education schools operate on a double or triple shift system which has reduced instruction time to about four hours a day, and limited the time available to reinforce learning, support slow learners, and offer remedial education and extracurricular activities. Psychosocial services are also struggling to cope with the nearly 300,000 children who require some form of mental health support or psychosocial intervention. 
 
Water and sanitation (WASH) infrastructure and delivery has also been impacted by recurrent conflict, the over exploitation of resources and restrictions on the import of “dual use” WASH items. Over 95 per cent of the water extracted from the aquifer is unfit for human consumption, with the result that 90 per cent of people in Gaza rely on purchasing desalinated water from private trucking, posing a heavy financial burden on already impoverished families and health risks due to widespread contamination of that source. Increased electricity cuts have further reduced the drinkable/ piped water supply and the operation of approximately 130 critical water and sanitation facilities. This has resulted in the discharge of untreated sewage into the sea, contaminating the majority of Gaza beaches, and heightening the risk of the overflow of raw sewage onto the streets.  

**Erosion of resilience** 

Recurrent hostilities, the blockade, degraded infrastructure and cuts in the allowances of public employees have impaired economic growth and perpetuated high levels of poverty, unemployment, (particularly among youth), and food insecurity. About 80 per cent of people in Gaza receive food assistance and other forms of social transfers which enable scarce cash resources to be spent on other essentials, preventing a further deterioration of food security and livelihood status, and reducing the impact of negative coping mechanisms. Increased power shortages have further undermined economic activity, particularly in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, with some 30,000 out of 80,000 dunums planted with seasonal vegetable crops at risk due to irregular irrigation, and dairy cattle farmers and poultry breeders also facing significant losses. The condition of the aquifer, Gaza’s sole source of natural water, is of particular concern as it will be “unusable” by end-2017, with damage “irreversible” by 2020, “unless immediate remedial action is taken.”",12033,"Mine Action"
2384969,"Somalia: Humanitarian Dashboard - November 2017 (issued on 20 December 2017) **SITUATION OVERVIEW**

The unprecedented drought and conflict have resulted in severe and growing humanitarian needs, according to the Humanitarian Needs Overview released on 29 November. Over 6.2 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, half of these require urgent life-saving assistance. This includes 866,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as of November 2017, reflecting a sharp spike in the number of most vulnerable people, up from 83,000 people in Emergency in January 2017. More than one-third of those in need are internally displaced persons (IDPs).  
Humanitarians continue to reach over three million people per month with life-saving assistance and livelihood support. However, with humanitarian needs growing, famine prevention efforts need to be sustained into 2018, alongside scaling up of livelihoods support to prevent populations at risk from sliding deeper into food insecurity. Early funding next year, to support the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, will be critical to enable humanitarian partners to sustain the current life-saving efforts.",12033,"Mine Action"
2383854,"Adopting Resolution 2393 (2017), Security Council Renews Authorization for Cross‑Border, Cross‑Line Humanitarian Access to Syria [EN/AR] SC/13127  
SECURITY COUNCIL  
8141ST MEETING (AM)  

The Security Council today renewed the authorization for cross‑border and cross‑conflict‑line humanitarian access to Syria for a further 12 months, until 10 January 2019.

Adopting resolution 2393 (2017) by a vote of 12 in favour to none against, with 3 abstentions (Bolivia, China, Russian Federation), the Council extended the authorization — first established by resolution 2165 (2014) — for United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners to use four border crossings.  The extension also included the use of routes between areas under control by different groups in the conflict, following notification to Syrian authorities.

By the text, the Council requested the Syrian authorities to expeditiously respond to all requests for cross‑line deliveries by the humanitarian partners.  It reiterated its demand that the authorities and all parties comply with their obligations under humanitarian law to allow aid access, recalling that some of the violations in Syria could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

It also requested the Secretary‑General to conduct, within six months, a review of the cross‑border operations that included recommendations on how to further strengthen the monitoring mechanism, taking into account the views of relevant parties, including the Syrian authorities, neighbouring counties and the humanitarian partners.

While welcoming the adoption, Council members also expressed reservations.  Most voiced their deep concern over the continuing humanitarian tragedy in Syria and stressed that, even with improved access, the suffering would not end until a Syrian‑led political solution was found through full participation of all parties in the Geneva process shepherded by the United Nations.

Olof Skoog (Sweden), who co‑sponsored the resolution with Egypt, pointed out that there were no alternative means to access parts of northern and southern Syria.  Renewing the authorization would no doubt save lives and alleviate suffering.  However, the humanitarian situation remained devastating.  For over six years, the world had failed the Syrian people.  The humanitarian situation would continue to deteriorate in the absence of a political solution.

Wu Haitao (China), explaining his abstention, said that while his country remained deeply concerned over the humanitarian situation, aid operations must change with the situation on the ground and must abide by United Nations humanitarian principles.  Cross‑border operations must be carried out in strict observance of the principles of national sovereignty and unity and with full participation of national authorities.  He had worked hard on the draft in order to improve aid delivery in the country, he noted, but added that not enough time had been allowed to improve the draft and to reach consensus.

Similarly, Pedro Luis Inchauste Jordán (Bolivia) said the situation had changed with the establishment of de‑escalation zones.  Yet, the text did not reflect those changes.  Adequate provision for the full transparency of the Monitoring Mechanism was also lacking.

Vladimir K. Safronkov (Russian Federation) stressed that the authorization was meant to be a temporary measure that necessarily impinged on Syrian sovereignty and was meant to reach all Syrians across the country.  Unfortunately, the location and means of distributions were often controlled by non‑governmental organizations.  While aid delivery authorized by the resolution remained critical, many of his reservations had not been met, and many questions remained unanswered, he said.  Better monitoring and consultation were among the measures needed to remediate those problems.  All information on deliveries should be shared with the Council, and a transition to more traditional means of providing assistance in coordination with the Syrian authorities should gradually end the cross‑border schemes as the situation on the ground changed.

Kairat Umarov (Kazakhstan), welcoming the compromises that had been achieved in the text, said he agreed that cross‑border assistance was critical for the survival of the Syrian population.  It was for that reason he had voted in favour.  He urged strong monitoring, however, of the transport involved and called for concerted efforts by the Security Council to end the conflict.

Echoing his counterpart’s stance, Fodé Seck (Senegal) too said that the monitoring mechanism could be improved.  Nonetheless, renewing the authorization was critical for saving lives and could not be delayed.

Michele J. Sison (United States) welcomed the adoption without reservations.  She argued that 17,000 aid deliveries, all vetted by the monitoring mechanism, had already been made possible by the authorization and had saved many lives.

François Delattre (France) said that the renewal was vital in every sense of the word.  For millions of Syrian people it was a matter of life or death.  He added that he had not agreed with all amendments that had been made to the text.  However, those did not change the resolution’s efficacy.  He also highlighted the suffering in Ghouta, where the regime was starving the population for strategic purposes.

Matthew John Rycroft (United Kingdom), stating that the renewal gave Syrians a small ray of hope, pointed out that the number of people in serious need in the country had risen to 13 million because of the lack of progress in the peace process and the blockades by the Syrian regime.  He called on the Russian Federation to use its influence on that regime to alleviate the situation.  The renewal was a strong reminder that aid must not be used as a weapon, he emphasized.

Inigo Lambertini (Italy), welcoming the extension, stressed the importance of the predictability of aid.  Still, he would have liked the resolution to address the failure of cross‑line assistance in providing urgent aid to areas such as Ghouta, he stated.

Yuriy Vitrenko (Ukraine), also welcoming the adoption, joined fellow Council members in affirming that cross‑border delivery was a matter of life and death.  However, he voiced his regret that the humanitarian situation had not improved in the past year because of continued lack of access in areas such as eastern Ghouta.

Tekeda Alemu (Ethiopia) expressed his appreciation for the extensive consultations on the text.  The result had addressed all concerns.  Humanitarian suffering should continue to be at the centre of the Council’s attention in Syria, with accelerated efforts to bring about a political solution to the conflict, he underscored.

The meeting began at 10:06 a.m. and ended at 10:56 a.m.

2383664,"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock: Statement to the Security Council on the humanitarian situation in Syria, 19 December 2017 *As delivered* 

Thank you, Mr. President,  

Let me begin by welcoming the action you have taken today to adopt [Security Council resolution 2393](https://reliefweb.int/node/2383854). I note your request to the Secretary-General to conduct an independent review, and for us to work even harder on monitoring, reporting and data gathering. We will of course do all that.  
Cross-border deliveries will remain an essential part of our efforts to meet the needs of all those across Syria who require humanitarian assistance.

Mr. President,  

This will hardly be news to you, but it is important for me to repeat that in besieged eastern Ghouta increased fighting and lack of humanitarian access is rendering life unbearable for an estimated 393,000 people trapped inside the enclave. Thousands of civilians are caught in fighting that threatens their lives on a daily basis. Except for a pause of two days, intensive air and ground-based strikes have been reported every day since mid-November. There has been significant loss of civilian life and hundreds have been wounded, both in eastern Ghouta and in Damascus city, where shelling from the besieged enclave has continued.  

Over the past weeks, the UN and its humanitarian partners have been allowed to reach only seven per cent of those besieged in the towns and villages of eastern Ghouta. Tiny amounts of aid have been allowed in, enough for only a fraction of those in desperate need. Food shortages have led in many cases to severe acute malnutrition, and a nutrition sector survey conducted in November showed a rapid and significant deterioration in the nutritional status of children under the age of five. Nearly 12 per cent of children have been diagnosed with global acute malnutrition, a five-fold increase in the past ten months. That is the highest level of malnutrition recorded so far in the country since the conflict began. These children, whose lives depend on timely and targeted intervention, need our immediate support. 

In addition, more than 500 people in eastern Ghouta still require urgent medical evacuation.  
They include, 137 children, 231 girls and women, and 61 people over the age of 65. There are 73 people with severe cancer. There 25 patients with kidney failure. There are 97 people with heartdisease. There are five acutely malnourished children. Infants – some of them just one or two months old – will die if evacuation permits are not granted immediately. There have already been 16 civilian deaths among those waiting for permission to leave eastern Ghouta for medical reasons, including three in the last few days. Among them are a 45-day old infant, a nine-year old girl, and a quadriplegic.  

All that is needed is the green light from the Syrian authorities for these people to go to hospitals just a few miles outside of eastern Ghouta.

Mr. President,  

There has also been minimal progress in recent months in responding to the needs of those trapped and besieged in Foah, Kefraya and Yarmouk. Thus far this year, only a trickle of assistance has been allowed in for the people in need.

Mr. President,  

Humanitarian access continues to face restrictions in all the besieged and hard-to-reach locations.  
On average in 2017, only 27 per cent of people identified to receive assistance under the UN’s bi-monthly plans have in fact been reached through inter-agency cross-line convoys each month.  
Bureaucratic impediments, like the non-issuance of facilitation letters, continue to be a significant factor in these delays, despite the creation of the tripartite coordination mechanism intended to address such problems.  

In November, only five cross-line convoys were able to deploy, reaching 200,250 people in hardto-reach locations and 28,700 people in besieged locations out of a total besieged population of more than 400,000 people.  

So far in December, none – none – of our convoys have made it to any of the besieged locations.  
Only two convoys have received the necessary authorizations for deployment to hard-to-reach locations; namely the convoy to Harbanisfe in Hama Governorate and the one to Al Houla in Homs Governorate, on 14 December, which delivered assistance for 60,000 people. These deliveries were themselves delayed, following a reduction in the agreed number of beneficiaries by one-third from what had initially been approved in the access plan.  

This past month, the UN and its partners has continued to reach millions of people in need through regular programming to Government of Syria-controlled parts of the country and crossborder operations. Regular programming from within the country resulted in the delivery of humanitarian assistance to millions of people in need, including some 2.7 million people who received food assistance so far this month through more than 1,595 deliveries. Cross-border activities also remained a vital part of the humanitarian response, with the UN and its partners providing services for health, education, protection, water and sanitation, as well as humanitarian supplies. More than 650 trucks have this month delivered food assistance to more over 900,000 people through cross-border operations, as well as health assistance for nearly one million treatments.

Mr. President,  

The overall humanitarian and protection situation for civilians displaced from Raqqa city remains of high concern to me, particularly due to explosive remnants of war and mines. Civilian death and injury due to mine explosions continue to be reported with alarming frequency. More than 125 civilians have been killed and almost 200 trauma cases have been reported since the end of military activities in Raqqa city. Contamination from explosive hazards, including improvised explosive devices, presents a major threat and impediment to enable safe returns. The full scale of the contamination is not yet fully known given lack of a systematic survey of the city. In addition to the threat posed by unexploded ordnance, up to 80 per cent of all buildings in Raqqa city are severely damaged, and at risk of collapse. These conditions mean that humanitarian organizations have only very limited access and presence on the ground.  

In Deir ez-Zor Governorate, military offensives to retake the remaining ISIL-held areas continue to prompt significant population displacement. More than 250,000 displacements were registered in November. Government advances against ISIL along the Euphrates River have displaced thousands of people from Abu Kamal sub-district, near the border with Iraq. Military operations and associated heavy aerial attacks have reportedly resulted in more than 150 civilian casualties. The majority of IDPs are suffering in dire circumstances, due to an extreme shortage of shelter, food and safe water. On 12 December, a Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy was finally able to deliver food, health and other relief items provided by the UN and other partners to some 15,000 children, women and men in Abu Kamal city. 

Mr. President,  

People continue to suffer from the effects of conflict in other areas of the country that have received less attention. Increased fighting in the last two months in Hama, Idleb and Aleppo Governorates resulted in more than 90,000 people being displaced. Most of these people moved further into Idleb Governorate, which is already under strain from hosting extraordinary numbers of IDPs. The humanitarian response in this area has been difficult due to the ongoing violence, and what little humanitarian infrastructure there is continues to be impacted by the fighting.

Mr. President,  

October and November were the worst months this year for displacement, with 440,000 people forced to move in October and almost 375,000 in November. That brings the total number of people displaced just this year to around 2.6 million – 7,700 displacements every day. Many have been displaced more than once.

Mr. President,  

The last time humanitarian assistance was delivered to the people in Rukban camp located on the border with Jordan, was in June this year. I am urging, still, the Government of Syria to authorize – as a matter of urgency – inter-agency deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance to them from Damascus. In the meantime, let me say that I am very grateful for efforts to permit an exceptional delivery of humanitarian assistance from Jordan to those people and I hope that can happen straight away.

Mr. President,  

The civilian population of Syria deserves to see a tangible improvement in their daily lives because they have always borne the brunt of this unrelenting conflict. I urge you all to do everything that you can to ensure that 2018 brings some relief to their suffering.  
Thank you.",12033,"Mine Action"
2383614,"ACT Alliance Concept Note IRQ181: Support to IDPs and their Host Communities – Follow on Response **Background**

The current crisis in Iraq began in June 2014, when militants of the Islamic State (ISIS) seized control of over one third of Iraq’s territory within a few weeks. Iraqi Security Forces, the Kurdish Peshmerga and various armed groups engaged in the fight against ISIS, and finally recaptured Ramadi in February 2016, Hīt in April 2016, Fallujah in June 2016, Mosul in July 2017, Tal Afar in August 2017 and Hawija in October 2017. The Government of Iraq announced the defeat of ISIS and regained full territorial control on 9 December.  

With the major military operations coming to end, many people are now able to return to their homes, and previously experienced large-scale displacements are likely to be over by 2018. However, smaller scale movements are still expected resulting from the tension between the government of Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government, triggered by the referendum on Kurdish independence on 25 September 2017.  

According to UN estimations, 8.7 million people will require some form of humanitarian assistance in 2018. In December 2017, the number of displaced persons is 2.8 million; the number of returnees is above 2.8 million. The humanitarian crisis in Iraq remains one of the largest and most volatile in the world, with a complex reality and rapidly changing vulnerabilities and serious economic problems.  
However, with the defeat of ISIS there is now a high chance of a protracted crisis with decreasing attention, while there is still great need for help in order to break the cycle that lead to the current events.",12033,"Mine Action"
2383564,"Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of 19:30, 18 December 2017 This report is for the media and the general public.

The SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations in Donetsk region and a similar number in Luhansk region compared with the previous reporting period. The Mission continued monitoring the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske. Its access remained restricted in the disengagement areas and elsewhere, including near Yurivka and Khoroshe.* The Mission saw weapons in violation of withdrawal lines near Bakhmut. In Donetsk region the SMM confirmed that Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) had withdrawn from their duties in five JCCC offices. The SMM was positioned on both sides of the Maiorsk entry-exit checkpoint to monitor their crossing of the contact line, but no crossing took place. The SMM observed a calm situation at the protest camp near the Parliament building in Kyiv.

In Donetsk region the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations[1], including about 650 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 790 explosions).

While in government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk) on the evening of 17-18 December, the SMM heard 172 undetermined explosions at eastern, southerly and western directions at distances ranging 2-10km, 71 explosions assessed as outgoing rounds (including six assessed as 120mm mortar rounds) 2-5km east and south-east, 31 explosions assessed as impacts (including three assessed as artillery rounds 1-2km east, two assessed as 82mm mortar rounds and the remainder undetermined) 1-5km east and south-east, six minutes of uncountable overlapping bursts of infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) (BMP-2) cannon (30mm), heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire 1-7km east and south-east and heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire 2-5km south-east.  On the same evening, the SMM also saw eight outgoing explosions (two assessed as artillery and the remainder undetermined) 5-12km west and south-east (and heard seven subsequent impacts 1-2km east and 3-5km west)

Positioned at the same location during the day on 18 December, the SMM heard 85 undetermined explosions, 29 explosions assessed as impacts (seven assessed as mortar (82mm) rounds, one as recoilless gun (SPG-9) (73mm) fire and the remainder undetermined) and bursts of IFV (BMP-2) cannon and automatic grenade launcher (AGS) fire 2-5km at directions ranging from south-east to west.

On the night of 17-18 December, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, an undetermined explosion, a projectile in flight from east to west, two undetermined explosions, a projectile from east to west and two from west to east, followed by a total of 86 undetermined explosions, 178 projectiles from east to west and 107 projectiles from west to east, all 0.5-1.5km south. During the day on 18 December, the camera recorded 32 projectiles from east to west, three from west to east, two undetermined explosions, an airburst and a projectile in vertical flight, all 0.5-1.5km south.

On the night of 17-18 December, the SMM camera 1km south-west of Shyrokyne (20km east of Mariupol) recorded a total of 69 projectiles in flight from east to west, eight from west to east and three undetermined explosions, all 5-8km north.

Positioned at the railway station in “DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata (16km north-east of Donetsk) for about five hours, the SMM heard 72 undetermined explosions, heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire – including one minute of uncountable overlapping bursts – 1-3km east and 2-5km west and north-west.

Positioned on the south-western edge of government-controlled Avdiivka (17km north of Donetsk) for about six hours, the SMM heard 54 undetermined explosions and heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire 2-4km east, south, south-east and south-south-west.

Positioned at the central railway station in “DPR”-controlled Donetsk (6km north-west of Donetsk city centre) for about three and a half hours, the SMM heard 13 undetermined explosions and small-arms fire 2-5km west and north-west.

Positioned in “DPR”-controlled Bezimenne (30km east of Mariupol) for about 20 minutes, the SMM heard 21 undetermined explosions at an unknown distance north-west.

In Luhansk region, the SMM recorded a similar number of ceasefire violations, including 239 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 240 explosions).

While in government-controlled Popasna (69km west of Luhansk) on the night of 17-18 December, the SMM heard 135 undetermined explosions 3-10km south-west and south-east, 23 assessed as outgoing explosions (20 as impacts of mortar (82mm) rounds, three as IFV (BMP-1) cannon (73mm) rounds 3-4km south-east), 40 explosions assessed as outgoing and impacts of artillery (152mm) rounds 6-8km south-west, two explosions assessed as impacts of mortar (82mm) rounds 3-4km south-east and automatic grenade launcher (AGS-17), heavy-machine-gun and small-arms fire 3-4km south-east.

Positioned in “LPR”-controlled Berezivske (53km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard 22 explosions 7-12km east over 12 minutes.

In Donetsk region, the SMM confirmed that Russian Federation Armed Forces officers of the JCCC had withdrawn from their duties in five JCCC offices. The SMM called JCCC duty phones in “DPR”-controlled Oleksandrivka (20km south-west of Donetsk) and Yasynuvata on 18 December and found that they were answered by persons who introduced themselves as “ministry of emergency situations” members. The duty phone in “DPR”-controlled Debaltseve (58km north-east of Donetsk) was answered by someone introducing himself as an “LPR” member of a “contact group”.

Ahead of the plan of the Russian Federation Armed Forces to withdraw their JCCC officers from Ukraine on 19 December, the SMM was ready to facilitate and monitor their crossing of the contact line at the Maiorsk entry-exit checkpoint (45km north-east of Donetsk). A Ukrainian Armed Forces representative of the JCCC told the SMM that they expected the arrival of two buses from Kharkiv sometime after 17:00. When the SMM left the area at 17:10 no crossing had taken place. However, the SMM was told by the Russian side that the Russian Federation Armed Forces JCCC contingent had not crossed the contact line on 18 December, as they said the buses required to transport them were not available. They told the SMM that they would attempt to cross the contact line again on 19 December.

The SMM followed up on reports of damage to residential areas in “DPR”-controlled Sakhanka (24km north-east of Mariupol). At 20 Zhovtneva Street, the SMM saw a fresh crater on a road 6m from a house. The house had sustained minor shrapnel marks to the west-facing walls and had broken west-facing windows. The SMM saw a second crater, about 50m further west from the first. A female resident (in her fifties) told the SMM that the area was shelled between 10:30 and 11:00 on 17 December.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of the respective withdrawal lines in a government-controlled area, the SMM observed two self-propelled  howitzers (2S1, Gvozdika 122mm) near government-controlled Bakhmut (formerly Artemivsk, 67km north of Donetsk).

Beyond the withdrawal lines in an area outside of government control, the SMM observed two stationary tanks (T-64) near Uspenka (23km south-west of Luhansk).

Beyond the withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, the SMM observed four towed howitzers (2A36 Giatsint-B, 152mm) near Azovske (22km south-west of Mariupol).

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles and anti-aircraft weapons,[2] and other indications of military-type presence in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted two armoured personnel carriers (APC) (one MT-LB and one undetermined) near Lobacheve (17km north-west of Luhansk) on 15 December and an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) near Sakhanka on 17 December. On 18 December, the SMM saw 11 IFVs (eight BMP-1s and three BMP variants), an APC (MT-LB) and two reconnaissance vehicles (BRM-1K) in different areas near Popasna, as well as an IFV (BMP-2) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk).

In non-government-controlled areas, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted six APCs (five BTR variants and one MT-LB with a probable anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23) mounted on top) and a reconnaissance vehicle (BDRM) near Uzhivka (96km south of Donetsk) on 17 December. On 18 December, the SMM saw five IFVs (three BMP-2s and two BMP-1) near Novolaspa (50km south of Donetsk).

Between “DPR”-controlled Azov (formerly Dzerzhynske, 25km north-east of Mariupol) and Nova Tavriia (25km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM saw two recently excavated trenches (one or two days old) both 4-6m long and 1.5m deep in fields west of the road.

The SMM visited two border crossing points in areas outside of government-control. During an hour-long visit to the border crossing point in Izvaryne (52km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM saw 16 cars, a minivan, a bus, a covered truck and 60 pedestrians (24 women and 36 men, aged 20-70) exiting Ukraine. The SMM saw a man (aged about 45) in military-style winter camouflage clothing with a badge reading “Polite People” (written in Russian) on his left arm, carrying a sports bag. The SMM saw 16 cars, four covered trucks (one with “LPR” plates on the front and Ukrainian licence plates on the back), a bus (carrying about 40 passengers), 90 pedestrians (40 men and 50 women, aged 20-70 and two girls aged about six) entering Ukraine.

During a thirty-minute visit to the pedestrian border crossing point in Verkhnohasymivka (57km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM saw four people (all women, aged about 50) exiting Ukraine and nine people (five men, aged about 40 and four women, aged about 55) entering Ukraine.

The SMM observed a calm situation at the protest camp near the Parliament building in Kyiv and saw five people warming themselves next to a fire. The SMM observed a small number of police officers outside the Parliament building.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro and Chernivtsi.",12033,"Mine Action"
2383119,"Protection Sector Mid-Year Review: January-June 2017 **A protection response along a common multiyear humanitarian strategy**

For the first time in Sudan, a multi-year humanitarian strategy has been adopted by the humanitarian community. Along with other sectors, the protection sector, and its child protection, GBV and mine action subsectors, started to review its response to ensure consistency with the humanitarian strategy, which proposes results reflecting three areas of concern. 

The first one relates to the assistance and protection needs facing people and communities newly affected by conflict, violence or disasters. For the protection sector, this requires primarily the provision of emergency protection services to communities newly displaced, as those from Jebel Mara in 2016. This year, the protection sector was also able, with other humanitarian sectors, to access areas within Jebel Marra. 

The second result pursued under the multi-year humanitarian strategy relates to the capacity of communities in protracted displacement to access services in a sustainable way. For the protection sector, this means in particular to strengthen community structures, such as women centres, or child protection networks, and enable them to provide protection to vulnerable individuals or households and provide spaces and support for counseling and referral to other services. It also includes land clearance from explosive remnants of war. 

Finally, the protection sector identified its role in the response to malnutrition in Sudan, through its child protection component. A multiyear approach means building blocks which contribute to results with a longer lifespan. The protection sector has started to identify these building blocks, and works through a multiyear sequence of activities, in particular in support to community capacities. 

This document reports achievements reached under each outcome of the humanitarian response plan 2017, for the first half of the year. Emergency needs and limited funding obliged partners to direct their resources on rapid response. A multiyear approach will only be meaningful if we accompany communities beyond emergencies. The linkage with development partners remains to be established.",12033,"Mine Action"

The session was brought forth by the Lebanon Mine Action Center (LMAC) at the Lebanese Armed Forces in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Lebanon.

“Support should be provided to establish the first regional demining school, equipped with necessary training courses,” said Mrs. Randa Berri, representing non-governmental organizations providing assistance to mine victims, during her opening statement.

“Mine action and mine victims’ assistance is a key pillar and an integral part in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable development. You [addressing the mine victims] demonstrate resilience despite obstacles you face,” addressed UNDP Country Director, Mrs. Celine Moyroud.

LMAC Director, Brigadier-General Ziad Nasr stated: “The LMAC stands by mine victims through supporting this cause. People with special needs, like other, have the right to equality.”

“The law should be compromised of feasible decrees and practical mechanisms that would provide people with disabilities, their rights. The hardships of people with disabilities still persist,” addressed H.E. Dr. Michel Moussa, representing the Head of the Parliament, H.E. Mr. Nabih Berri.

“The state needs to value each citizen as a precious resource and recognize that each person has a legitimate role to contribute to the development of a society where every person’s rights are respected,” stated Mrs. Francesca Varlese, the European Union representative.

The Parliament session was concluded with a ‘question and answer session’ amongst the mine victims and the members of Parliament and government representatives, where mine victims raised their questions and concerns related to their rights of employment in public and private sectors, easy access of disabled persons to public institutions. They stressed on the importance of having awareness campaign for the public at large on how to deal with the needs of disabled persons.",12033,"Mine Action"

The IDP Hosting Site Baseline Assessment aims to support targeting and response planning by humanitarian stakeholders, including authorities, UN agencies, local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). It provides a baseline of key multi-sectoral indicators across IDP hosting sites in 22 governorates, based on data collected through interviews with key informants in each site.  

The baseline assessment will help to inform the site management support which will be offered to the local authorities and humanitarian actors in charge of IDP hosting sites, as well as the support which will be offered to IDPs to establish self-governance, community participation and communication processes within IDP hosting sites. 
 
The IDP Hosting Site Baseline Assessment is organised and supported by the Shelter / NFI / CCCM Cluster coordination team and cluster partners engaged in the activity. The data collection for the baseline assessment has been carried out by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in 18 governorates and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 4 governorates.  

Once the baseline of current sites is finalised, its updates will be carried out every six months to cover newly established sites. Monitoring of the sites identified through the baseline and its updates will be carried out continuously. The information generated over time through monitoring data collection will provide an indication of structural and sectoral changes in the conditions of the sites.

2382484,"Syria Crisis: Northeast Syria Situation Report No. 19 (6 November – 10 December 2017) **Highlights**

- The overall humanitarian and protection situation for civilians displaced from Ar-Raqqa city remains of high concern, particularly with regard to explosive hazards contamination, amongst other factors. Surveys and clearance of potentially contaminated areas is required to ensure access for humanitarian partners and create a safe environment that is conducive for safe, voluntary and informed returns.

- Despite continued messaging against returning to areas contaminated with explosive hazards, death and injury due to mine explosions continue to be reported with alarming frequency with trauma cases nearly doubling since the height of the military offensive. Between 20 October and 13 December, approximately 209 civilians were reportedly killed and hundreds of others injured due to presence of explosive hazards in Ar-Raqqa city.

- The humanitarian community has developed a joint position paper on the return to Ar-Raqqa city, highlighting the imperative of safety, voluntary, well informed and sustainable return as the criteria guiding interventions in support to the return of the displaced population.

- Ongoing military operations in Deir-ez-Zor and associated heavy aerial attacks have reportedly resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, as well as increased civilian displacement. During the reporting period, an alarming number of unconfirmed indiscriminate airstrike attacks against 15 IDP sites reportedly killed 166 civilians and injured hundreds more. 

**20,694** people displaced from Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor governorates between 1 – 30 November (Source: CCCM Cluster). Over 570,000 displacements recorded since November 2016

**420,186** people reached with food assistance from 1 – 30 November in ArRaqqa,

**91,610** people benefiting from nutrition assistance distributed in Ar-Raqqa, Deir-ezZor and Hassakeh governorates from 1 – 30 November

**15,700** children aged 0-59 months were vaccinated against polio in Al-Hassakeh governorate from 1 – 30 November

**Situation Overview**

**Ar-Raqqa Governorate**

With reduction of hostilities across the governorate since late October, thousands of IDPs seek to return to their communities of origin, likely to locations in severe need of mine action and repairs to shelters, roads and other infrastructure and with severely limited basic services.

In Ar-Raqqa city, some civilians are reportedly returning to the east and western peripheries of the city despite continued warnings by parties in control to urge residents to not return until mine clearance operations are completed. Numbers of returnees remain difficult to verify, as many people simply return to Ar-Raqqa to check on their houses and belongings, inspect the extent of damage to their property, carry out simple repairs and leave soon after. A few choose to stay. According to local authorities, approximately 12,500 people returned to the Ma’amoun and Tishreen neighborhoods. Approximately 130 families have returned to Hetin neighborhood and an estimated 20 IDP families reportedly returned to the Ammar Ibn Yaser neighborhood in Ar-Raqqa city. According to parties in control, about 2,100 families also returned to Al-Mashlab neighborhood east of Ar-Raqqa city. Qassedin neighborhood was also declared cleared for civilian returns in early December by parties in control. 

One of the most pressing challenges facing returnees to Ar-Raqqa city is the presence of scores of IEDs and landmines. Residents will be allowed by parties in control to return on a neighborhood-to-neighborhood basis, as each is declared free of landmines and rubble removed. To date, only Tishreen, Hettin and Ma’amoun neighborhoods in the eastern part of Ar-Raqqa city have been declared cleared by parties in control for civilian returns, while individuals who had previously returned to the Yarmouk neighborhood were permitted to stay. Mine action partners however, continue to warn that areas declared as ‘cleared’ continue to be unsafe for civilians particularly as clearance efforts taking place are limited to roads and critical infrastructure and do not include residential areas which remain highly contaminated. Those who have returned permanently did so due to the lack of any other options, and are therefore considered to be in dire need. 

As IDPs return to Ar-Raqqa city, the number of protection incidents from explosive remnants of war (ERWs) has increased. Between 20 October and 13 December, approximately 209 civilians were reportedly killed and many others injured due to presence of explosive hazards. Amongst those killed, four were individuals working for mine action partners. This trend is likely to continue, particularly since mine clearance activities do not include householdlevel clearance. 

Humanitarian partners continue robust messaging in IDP sites that Ar-Raqqa city and surrounding areas are not safe for returns, as well as against provision of broad humanitarian assistance in Ar-Raqqa city which may create a pull factor for IDPs. The humanitarian community has developed a joint position paper on the return to Ar-Raqqa city, highlighting the imperative of safety, voluntary, well informed and sustainable return as the criteria guiding any intervention in support to the return of the displaced population. 

In addition to the threat posed by unexploded hazards, up to 80 per cent of all buildings in Ar-Raqqa city are severely damaged, and at risk of collapse. Many corpses reportedly remain trapped under the rubble, where they, until adequately buried, pose a risk of spreading communicable diseases amongst the returnee population. Rubble removal work will be conducted in tandem with a medical team. 

Returnees to Ar-Raqqa city reportedly face additional challenges amidst a shortage of basic necessities and services. Electricity and waste management services are unavailable, and about 60 per cent of the sewage system is damaged. Water is being pumped for two hours per day, however, 40 per cent of returnees to Ma’amoun neighborhood do not have access to water due to damage in the water supply network and many resort to purchasing water. Some food can be purchased in the reopened stores, and bread is being produced by local bakeries. The single greatest protection concern, however, remains the prevalence of UXOs and landmines despite Tishreen and Ma’amoun neighborhoods having been officially opened for civilian returns by parties in control, following demining efforts.  
During the reporting period, between 70 and 80 trauma cases were reported from Ma’amoun alone, with almost all blast injuries occurring in the victims’ homes or in the immediate vicinity of their home. 

In the western countryside of Ar-Raqqa governorate, electricity returned to around 13 villages after village-level initiatives succeeded in repairing the damaged networks in these villages. The local authorities carried out repair works of the damaged part of the networks between the different villages, and connected them to the lines that are coming from the Tabqa dam. 

In Ath-Thawrah (Tabqa) town and surrounding communities, the legislative council passed the conscription law for men between the age of 18 – 40 years old. The law offers exemption for several cases including men with medical conditions and those who have already had lost a family member while fighting with the SDF, however, NGO workers are not among the exempted category. Similar to Menbij district, the issue of conscription is likely to present a challenge for NGOs operating in the area, as a significant number of NGO workers are between 18 – 40 years of age. The general perception of the law by the locals is mostly negative, which could lead to tensions – similar to those recently seen in Menbij district - between the locals and the authorities. 

On 27 November, local authorities issued a circular asking NGOs not to hire any workers outside of the list that is provided by the local labour office. Following discussions between humanitarians and local authorities, the latter agreed to adjust its position and issued another circular with the following five points: i) NGOs are requested to share job advertisements with all councils and publicly on social media, ii) NGOs are requested to clarify the type of requirements that are needed for the advertised position, iii) Priority to be given to locals from the area, iv) NGOs are entitled to accept applicants irrespective of whether they are registered with the labor office, v) NGOs are urged not to hire more than one person from the same family. 

In Government of Syria (GoS) controlled areas of Ar-Raqqa governorate, an estimated 1,800 IDP families have reportedly returned the eastern countryside. An estimated 800 families have returned to Ma’adan area in the southern and western banks of the Euphrates River, where some basic services have been restored. In Debsi and Mansura villages, so far about 1,900 families have returned after access to water was reportedly restored. Another 35 IDP families reportedly returned to Sabkha town and the countryside, where humanitarian conditions reportedly remain dire. As there are reportedly no bakeries available in the area, bread is reportedly smuggled from SDF-controlled areas for 300 SY/bundle. People also purchase basic commodities from the SDF-controlled areas. The only available health center in the area is not operational due to lack of equipment and staff. The area also lacks drinkable water in quantities sufficient from all returnees. Although SARC had sent a water purification station to the area on 20 November, drinkable water remains scarce due to a shortage of fuel which means that the pump cannot be operated effectively.  

Significant humanitarian gaps remain across the governorate, particularly in strained communities hosting thousands of displaced people. Access to clean water and electricity is severely limited throughout the governorate. The lack of operational health care facilities in remains a critical concern with approximately 92 per cent of the 77 health facilities in Ar-Raqqa governorate are non-functional, with only one health facility fully functional. Many IDPs are in need of adequate shelter, particularly in informal tented settlements, where IDPs are using makeshift shelters or are sleeping in the open.",12033,"Mine Action"

**Mali**

Our colleagues from the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) tell us that a patrol — a UN patrol — hit a suspected improvised explosive device in Kidal city this morning. One peacekeeper was slightly wounded. In response to the attack, the Mission deployed a Quick Reaction Force and an explosive ordnance disposal team to secure and clear the incident site and to recover a vehicle that was damaged. This follows four separate attacks against peacekeeping personnel and premises in Kidal on Friday, all of which were repelled by peacekeepers. One peacekeeper was severely wounded. Two UN Mission staff and two civilians were slightly wounded, as well, and they were immediately given medical attention.

2380074,"Statement: 20 years after the historic treaty on landmines, we cannot afford to lose momentum *ICRC President's address to the Meeting of States Parties, Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention.*

Twenty years ago anti-personnel mines were a regular and lethal feature of armed conflicts across the world. Combatant or civilian: these weapons struck indiscriminately.

At that time a staggering 20,000 people, the vast majority civilians, were killed or mutilated by anti-personnel mines every year.

Amid a swell of global condemnation, one of my predecessors was incensed by the impact of these weapons, which he described as 'abominable (and)... a destructive technology out of control'.

He called on the international community to uphold a 'moral, political and legal obligation and to put an end to the mass destruction in slow motion' caused by mines.

The global crisis of human suffering required a global solution: the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. It was the result of a remarkable partnership between States, civil society and international organisations, including the ICRC and the broader International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement. And importantly, the treaty would not have been possible without the determined advocacy of landmine survivors themselves.

The treaty brought unprecedented attention to the plight of the people and communities affected by landmines and other unexploded ordnance. And it was extraordinary in its approach:

- It was the first time that a weapon in widespread use had been prohibited due to its appalling human, economic and social costs;

- It was the first treaty of international humanitarian law to prohibit not only the use of a weapon, but also its production, stockpiling and transfer... and to require its elimination; and - It also demanded that States provide assistance for victims, and mobilize resources to clear contaminated land.

And let us not forget that this progress was possible also, because of the support of many members of armed forces who understood early on the political and moral unacceptability of a continued use of these weapons.

Today, the goal of a world-free of antipersonnel mines is within reach. Broad adherence to the treaty has seen:

The use of anti-personnel mines diminish;

- More than 53 million anti-personnel mines destroyed;

- Thousands of square kilometres of mined lands cleared; and - The legal trade virtually disappear.

And as a result, countless numbers of lives have been saved.

However, on this anniversary, I fear that we have reached a dangerous crossroads.

Landmine victims may not be on the front pages of the newspapers as they were in the 1980s and 1990s but today mine casualties are rising sharply in some countries. Anti-personnel mines, in particular improvised mines, are taking a heavy toll on civilians in places including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. Shockingly children account for 42% of all civilian casualties.

Today, 35 States remain outside of the Convention, and many of these have huge stockpiles, totalling an estimated 45 million units. I do not wish to think of the casualties if these weapons were ever used. I encourage all States, who are not yet part of the Convention, to continuously reassess the military need for anti-personnel mines in light of their severe human costs. Those who have joined in the last 20 years wait impatiently for the Mine Ban Convention to become truly global treaty.

The ICRC sees all too often in our hospitals and rehabilitation centres the injuries caused by mine blasts. We work to fit victims of explosions with prostheses for missing limbs and to help them live a full life. We help where we can, but frankly no one should have to have to suffer the lifelong trauma, pain, social and economic disadvantage that mine victims face. And we engage and will continue to do so in Mine Risk Education to prevent accidents and to bring the number of victims down even before all the mines are cleared.

In 2014, States Parties expressed a determination to meet key goals of the Convention by 2025, that is, in just seven short years. There must be greater urgency and determination to ensure that these goals become a reality. Focused effort must be directed to make certain that by 2025:

- All stockpiles still held by States Parties are destroyed;

- Contaminated land is cleared within the Convention's deadlines and the 2025 commitments; and - Victims can access the care, rehabilitation and socio-economic services they need to participate in their societies on an equal basis to others.

Of critical importance is the commitment of funds to achieve these actions. I urge all State Parties able to do so to provide resources and exert influence where necessary. By 2025 the ICRC is advocating that affected States Parties are landmine free and with no new victims on their territories. No affected State Party should be left behind in this process. The international community must again use its collective determination, harness this remarkable partnership to overcome these challenges. As the 2025 deadline approaches, there is not a moment to waste.

The Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention is a shining example of how the international community can collectively respond to widespread suffering caused by the use of indiscriminate weapons. Since its adoption, new treaties have followed to protect civilians from explosive remnants of war and to prohibit cluster munitions. Short of developing new law, ensuring respect for existing IHL rules is critical to protect civilians from the indiscriminate effects of weapons.

In conflicts around the world the ICRC sees what happens when weapons are used without regard for civilian life, when the internationally agreed constraints of distinction, proportionality and precaution are disregarded. As we are witnessing in the ongoing armed conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Ukraine for example, the use of heavy explosive weapons in densely populated areas is having disastrous consequences for civilians. For example when a city is shelled the consequences are not limited to death, physical injury, but also include damage to critical infrastructure such as water and electrical facilities, hospitals and health services.

Given the enormous costs for civilians, the ICRC calls on all parties to avoid the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effect in populated areas, due to the significant likelihood of indiscriminate effects. All States should be in a position to apply this as a matter of good practice, to ensure better protection for civilians in urban warfare.

Today I call on the international community to harness the goodwill and common action that led to the adoption of the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention. I call on you to maintain vigilance against all weapons that cruelly and indifferently attack the innocent and for humanitarian law and the wisdom of humanity to prevail.

2379869,"Over 400,000 square meters of land cleared from landmines Luena - At least 476,043 square meters of land are free from landmines in the eastern Moxico province, fruit of the demining work carried out by the Mining Advisory Group (MAG) in the last 11 months.

The data were told to ANGOP on Saturday in Luena by the MAG community liaison manager, Cambembe Evaristo, stating that the demined lands were handed over to the populations of the localities of Lundjacuti, Tepa 1 and 2, localities of the commune of Lucusse of Moxico headquarters).

He noted that operations carried out by 36 MAG personnel also resulted in the collection and destruction of 89 anti-tank landmines, 188 anti-personnel landmines, 972 miscellaneous ammunitions and 552 uxos, such as projectiles, bombs, grenades, among other unexploded ordnance.

The official said that 191 lectures on community education on the risks of landmines, involving four thousand and 613 villagers, were also held.

He said that in 2018 MAG will continue to work to reduce areas suspected of being landmined to ensure security for the rural population and called on funders to continue to support the project.

2379344,"Landmine treaty meets in Vienna for annual review Vienna, Geneva, Amman -- Vienna might be miles away from the nearest mine field but today it hosts hundreds of government delegates, royalty, a Nobel Peace Laureate, and landmine experts and survivors to discuss how to best address anti-personnel mines. Last year, these weapons caused more than 8,500 casualties around the world.

The international diplomatic meeting with more than 400 delegates taking place in the Austrian capital is the annual gathering of the [Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention](https://www.apminebanconvention.org/) which prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of these weapons, ensure their destruction and calls for assistance of the victims of these arms. The treaty counts with [163 States Parties](https://www.apminebanconvention.org/states-parties-to-the-convention/) (Sri Lanka joined the Convention only a few days before the meeting).

Austria's chairing of the conference on its 20th anniversary illustrates its commitment to a mine-free world.

Twenty years ago, Austria was one of a core group of States that together with civil society brought about the Convention, hosting a governmental discussion in Vienna, and drafting the text of what would become international binding law.

The meeting is being chaired by the Austrian Ambassador Thomas Hajnoczi, Head of the Department for Disarmament who has been called the ""father of the Convention text"" for his key involvement in treaty negotiations 20 years ago.

""Anti-personnel mines are insidious weapons that kill civilians even decades after conflicts end. Anti-personnel mines prevent the use of land for agriculture, block children from taking the path to the nearest school, and cause misery and poverty. It was the horrific and indiscriminate impact of anti-personnel mines that led to the conviction that there is only one solution: banning them,"" said the Chair during the opening of the conference.

""The convention has come home today to the place where its drafting started and I am delighted to welcome you all here. We can proudly celebrate the twenty years anniversary; the convention has saved tens of thousands of lives and delivered great results in all its areas,"" added the Ambassador.

The International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, which was involved in creating the treaty was represented in the opening ceremony by its President, Peter Maurer.

""The treaty brought unprecedented attention to the plight of the people and communities affected by landmines and other unexploded ordnance. And it was extraordinary in its approach: It was the first time that a weapon in widespread use had been prohibited due to its appalling human, economic and social costs; it was also the first treaty of international humanitarian law to prohibit not only the use of a weapon but also its production, stockpiling and transfer... and to require its elimination, merging humanitarian and disarmament imperatives,"" said Maurer.

The Convention in his view however, is at a crossroads.

""In recent years mine casualties have risen sharply in some countries. Anti-personnel mines, in particular improvised mines, are taking a heavy toll on civilians in places including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. Shockingly children accounted for 42% of all civilian casualties,"" said Maurer referring to date published a few days ago by the Landmine Monitor, a publication created by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL).

The ICBL is the coalition of more than a thousand non-governmental organizations that pushed for the creation of the treaty. The ICBL and its coordinator, Jody Williams, were co-Laureates of the 1997 of the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in bringing about the Convention.

Jody Williams called for sustained commitment and cooperation to address the remaining challenges. More than 30 countries are still struggling against this scourge.

HRH Prince Mired of Jordan who has been the Special Envoy of the Convention spoke of what once was considered a ""mission impossible"".

""It was a daunting task,"" he said referring to the challenge that countries as Jordan faced. ""In April 2012, we announced we had finished clearing our minefields thanks to our commitment and that of donors. Demining is doable but requires a great deal of effort, a serious approach, political will, financial resources and in most cases, national ownership,"" added Prince Mired.

""Regarding the assistance to victims and survivors, I think we need to take an honest look at the plight of survivors in our respective countries and take concrete steps to intensify our victim assistance efforts for all persons with disabilities including landmine survivors.""

Prince Mired also talked about the engagement of States that are not party inviting all the Parties to engage with those outside the treaty at the highest level possible.

The meeting will continue at the UN in Vienna until 21 December. On Tuesday 19 December, HRH Princess Astrid of Belgium will inaugurate a panel on victim assistance including with the participation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, and Catalina Devandas, the UN Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities.

During the week some of the world's most mine contaminated countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Colombia and Serbia, will present updates of their work. It is expected that up to six countries, Angola, Ecuador, Iraq, Thailand, Ukraine and Zimbabwe will request additional time to meet their mine clearance obligations. Greece, Oman and Ukraine which have not yet completed their stockpile destruction obligation will present an update on their efforts to destroy these weapons.

Algeria will formally declare that after more than three decades it is now mine-free, and Belarus will announce that it has met its stockpile destruction obligation after destroying more than one million Soviet-era landmines.

On 21 December, mine-affected Afghanistan is expected to be elected as the next Chair of the Convention.

More than 51 million landmines have been destroyed by the Convention's States Parties and millions of square metres of land once contaminated have been returned for its normal use.

Press Note: the Convention was adopted in Oslo and signed in Ottawa in 1997, and entered into force in 1999. 80% of the world's states are now part of the treaty. 30 States have declared completing mine clearance; 29 states have declared responsibility for large numbers of survivors of these weapons.",12033,"Mine Action"

On 15 December, the SMM entered Travneve, accompanied by Ukrainian Armed Forces officers of the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) and representatives of the military-civil administration and State Emergency Services. In the village, the SMM observed that some houses had marks on their entrance gates: according to local residents, red circles indicated the houses were inhabited while black crosses meant they were uninhabited. The SMM noted that members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces had occupied some of the latter houses. The SMM also saw at least two soldiers with black Aidar battalion patches on their uniforms in the town. At the western end of Haidara Street, the SMM observed an armed man near a recently dug trench.

On 14 December, positioned at the disengagements areas near government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska and Petrivske, the SMM observed calm situations.

On 14 December, the Ukrainian Armed Forces representative to the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) in the JCCC headquarters in government-controlled Soledar (79km north of Donetsk) shared with the SMM a letter from the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation informing Ukraine that the Russian Federation would withdraw its Armed Forces officers from the JCCC.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

In a government-controlled area, the SMM saw ten self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm) in violation of the respective withdrawal lines near Oleksandropil (43km north of Donetsk).

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM observed seven towed howitzers (2A65 Msta-B, 152mm) and four anti-tank guns (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm), and noted that 20 self-propelled howitzers (2S1), 27 towed howitzers (19 2A65 – one of which was missing for the first time – and eight 2A36 Giatsint-B, 152mm) and eight anti-tank guns (MT-12) continued to be absent.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles and anti-aircraft guns[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, the SMM saw an armoured recovery vehicle (BTS-4) towing an IFV (BMP-1) near Semyhiria (58km north-east of Donetsk) and two armoured personnel carriers (APC) (MT-LB), one mounted with an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) atop, near Roty (66km north-east of Donetsk). On 11 December, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted five APCs – two BTR-70 and three MT-LB, one mounted with an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23) atop – near Vodiane (19km north-east of Mariupol). On 13 December, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted a military-type vehicle (MRAP) near Popasna.

The SMM followed up on the situation of civilians living in Travneve and Hladosove. (See SMM Daily Report 7 December 2017.) On 13 December, a staff member in the village council of Novoluhanske told the SMM that residents of Travneve either did not stay there overnight or spent the night in the basement of their houses because of shelling (see ceasefire violation section). He said that a power company had brought two generators to Travneve to supply electricity to the village. He also noted that the regular bus service bringing workers to Travneve from the pig farm in Novoluhanske had resumed three days before. (See SMM Daily Report 27 November 2017.) In Novoluhanske, on 14 December, military-civil administration staff told the SMM that two generators in Travneve supplied electricity to both the village and nearby Hladosove, adding that the bus service from Novoluhanske to Travneve had resumed several days before. They also said that in Hladosove there were 15 houses inhabited, mainly by elderly people, as well as by three children and a 22-year-old man with a disability. They noted that humanitarian aid was regularly distributed to the population in Travneve and Hladosove by international organizations.

The SMM visited the Petrivske pumping station in government-controlled Artema (26km north of Luhansk) where the head of the station told the Mission that the station had been without power since 5 December. He also said that water could not be pumped to non-government-controlled parts of Luhansk region – including the northern part of Luhansk city, Pryvitne (11km north of Luhansk), Obozne (18km north of Luhansk), Vesela Hora (16km north of Luhansk), Metalist (7km north-west of Luhansk) and Stukalova Balka (9km north of Luhansk) – while government-controlled Nyzhnoteple (26km north of Luhansk) and Artema were supplied with water from storage containers which were about halfway full. The SMM noted that there was no electricity or heating in the station.

The SMM facilitated and monitored repairs and maintenance works, co-ordinated by the JCCC, to a power line in Avdiivka. (See SMM Daily Report 13 December 2017.) On the morning of 14 December, the Mission saw four workers from a power company repairing eight damaged sections of the power line and observed the subsequent completion of the repairs. In the early afternoon, the SMM observed lights in different parts of Avdiivka.

The SMM also continued to facilitate and monitor repairs and maintenance work, co-ordinated by the JCCC, to a power line near Travneve (see the previous page), to the water pipeline near government-controlled Zalizne (formerly Artemove, 42km north-east of Donetsk), to the water pumping station near Artema, and to the power line near Vesela Hora.

The SMM visited a border area outside of government control. At a border crossing point near Voznesenivka (formerly Chervonopartyzansk, 65km south-east of Luhansk), during one hour, the SMM saw 15 cars, a bus and 19 pedestrians (11 women and eight men, aged 20-55) exiting Ukraine, and 14 cars and 12 pedestrians (seven men and five women, aged 20-55) entering Ukraine.

2378289,"Security Council Sanctions Committee on Central African Republic Meets with Panel of Experts, Hears Briefings on Weapons, Ammunition Management SC/13123

On 4 December 2017, the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) concerning the Central African Republic held informal consultations to consider the final report of the Panel of Experts and hear briefings by the United Nations Mine Action Service and United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) on weapons and ammunition management in the country.

In its presentation on the key findings and recommendations detailed in the report, the panel noted that the security situation, particularly in the south‑east and north‑west, had remained volatile and that no substantial progress on the political process had been achieved during the reporting period. The panel highlighted that self‑proclaimed self‑defence groups, loosely connected to some members of the anti‑balaka movement, had continued to implement their agenda of “liberation” of the south‑east, specifically targeting Muslims and peacekeepers. These attacks were fuelled by inflammatory anti‑Muslim and anti‑United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) rhetoric and disseminated via Bangui‑based instigators.

The panel noted that the dynamics among ex‑Séléka factions had changed after the signing of the Ippy agreement on 9 October 2017, which resulted in halting the intra‑Séléka fighting, securing freedom of movement on the Bria‑Bambari Road and reopening of the transhumance corridors. The panel also underlined that anti‑balaka and self‑proclaimed self‑defence groups had taken over the arms trafficking routes from Union pour la paix en Centrafrique in Bema, south‑east of Bangassou bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while in the north, arms trafficking activities by ex‑Séléka factions had temporarily decreased, owing to the rainy season.

Delegations emphasized that more cooperation was needed among the regional States to counter arms trafficking, and expressed concern with regard to the implementation of travel ban by the regional States. They also recalled the importance of the Central African Republic authorities implementing the asset freeze concerning listed nationals.

Providing an update since its last briefing to the Committee in May 2017, the representative of the Mine Action Service noted that his organization continued to actively assist national authorities of the Central African Republic by providing technical advice and expertise, building and refurbishing weapons and ammunition storage facilities and, in cooperation with UNIDIR, assisting the Central African Republic authorities in implementation of the two‑year (2017-2018) small arms and light weapons road map aimed at producing a national strategy and action plan. In his first briefing to the Committee, the representative of UNIDIR provided preliminary findings concerning its report on weapons and ammunition management in the Central African Republic, which would be published in the beginning of 2018.

Members of the Committee welcomed the briefings by the Mine Action Service and UNIDIR. Several members expressed appreciation for the panel’s final report, noting in particular the importance of its work in monitoring incitement to violence by armed groups, political leaders, religious and civil society representatives in the Central African Republic. Several members of the Committee also underlined the importance of ensuring the security of members of the Panel of Experts in the implementation of its mandate pursuant to paragraphs 27 and 28 of resolution 2339 (2017).

2377694,"Ukraine: Protection Cluster Factsheet - November 2017 [EN/UK/RU] **PROTECTION CONCERNS** 

- Security situation: In November 2017, OHCHR recorded 25 conflict-related civilian casualties: 5 people killed and 20 injured. 68% of all civilian casualties are mine-related. 

- Mine Action: On November 5, one child was reportedly killed and two more injured due to an unexploded ordinance detonation at a school in Staromykhailivka (Donetsk region, NGCA).  
On November 16, pupils were evacuated from a school in Kremenivka (Donetsk region, GCA), as an unexploded ordinance was found in the school yard. 

- Freedom of movement: According to Protection Cluster partner monitoring, the main road has been blocked by military in the village of Novohryhorivka (Donetsk region, GCA), so that civilians must use an unpaved path and cross a river, which only has a small, basic bridge. 

- House, Land & Property: According to Protection Cluster partner monitoring, 20 houses in Verkhnyotoretske (Donetsk region, GCA) have been occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2015. As a result, 15 families who cannot return to their property are forced to rent houses in the same town.  

 HRMMU reported an imminent risk of eviction of IDPs from a collective centre in Korostyshiv (Zhytomyr Region). The electricity had been cut, leaving 188 people, including 88 children and many persons with disabilities, without power, water and heating. 

- Access to social benefits and pensions: In multiple locations, queues of IDP pensioners trying to restore pensions after 6 months of suspension remain very long. For example, in Pokrovsk, IDPs register in queues 2 weeks before the scheduled appointment and in Mariupol IDP pensioners have to wait 3 weeks for an appointment. 

- Access to essential services: On November 3-5, the Donetsk Filter Station, which supplies water to 345,000 people on both sides of the contact line, was shelled at least three times. As a result, the back-up chlorine pipeline of the station was damaged by the shrapnel. This is alarming, as damage to the main pipe would cause leakage of poisonous chlorine gas into the environment.  

 On November 21, due to weather conditions, some 2,600 households in 21 locations of Luhanska region (GCA) were left without electricity. Moreover, on 23 November, an additional 21,000 households in 63 settlements were left without electricity. According to the Luhansk Energy Association, due to lack of financial resources, it would take days to restore the damaged infrastructure.  

 Settlements of Yasynuvatsky rayon and Avdiivka (Donetsk region, GCA) remain without centralized gas as the pipe supplying gas from NGCA was damaged in summer 2017. Regional authorities allocated funds for construction of the new line supplying gas from GCA. The repair works are still ongoing. 

- Social cohesion: According to IOM's National Monitoring Survey, as of September 2017, 15 % of IDPs stated that they experienced discrimination (compared to 10% in June 2017). Perceptions of discrimination noted by IDPs concerned housing (65%), employment (28%), and healthcare (26%).",12033,"Mine Action"

8 Protection Monitoring Task Force members conducted 519 Key Informant interviews in 39 communities covering 15 sub districts, 8 districts, 4 governorates (Aleppo, Homs, Idleb, and Rural Damascus) in October. On 26-27 October, the Cluster conducted a two-day workshop on the Protection of IDPs, attended by 25 participants representing 25 Syrian and international NGOs. At the end of the workshop, participants were able to identify the rights of IDPs and the corresponding obligations that governments and other involved actors have, according to the Framework on Internal Displacement.  The workshop was facilitated in Arabic and English, with simultaneous translation. The Cluster also facilitated a half day workshop on the 2018 results framework for the protection sector and protection risk analysis.

The GBV sub cluster participated in the strategic and technical review for the second standard allocation of the Humanitarian Fund. A number of projects with GBV components have passed final review with specific focus on continuity of services and integration of GBV services into existing service delivery points.  In the framework of the HRP, GBV SC worked with the protection cluster and Whole of Syria to finalize the HRP framework. As a result, development of the HRP was finalized and partners were consulted and trained on how to develop GBV project sheet for HRP. The GBV sub cluster also launched the GBV prevention task force focusing on prevention and risk mitigation work. The task force developed a work plan and worked to organize activities for 16 days of activism against violence against women. The GBV capacity building initiative is continuing as per plan. A Second self-care training was conducted from 2nd – 4th October with 11 female and 3 male participants. Furthermore, the monthly learning sessions were held for GBV service providers part of the second group of the GBV capacity building initiative, which focused on case discussion methodologies.

CP situation and response monitoring taskforce met on 9-10 October and achieved the following: (i) agreed on the sampling for situation monitoring (ii) finalized indicators for situation monitoring (iii) finalized tools for situation monitoring (iv) review materials for training data collectors. CP sub cluster on 27 October participated in a technical consultation on FTR organized by Turkey – UNHCR, UNICEF, IOM and Turkish Red Crescent. Participants agreed to map and document FTR capacities and procedures as the first step towards Turkey - cross border collaboration.

Risk Education materials continue to be integrated within other clusters and sub-clusters such as NFI, Protection, Food Security and Education. Until October, a total of 90547 Risk Education materials were distributed through local and international NGOs in Aleppo and Idleb.

**Gap**

Limited partners to pilot situation and response toolkit outside Idleb governorate. Difficulty in physical movement of children or adults for reunification purposes across borders or crossline.

Airstrikes may have ceased, but explosive hazards remain. Explosive hazard contamination in Northern Syria remains widespread due to past conflict and poses serious risks to civilians, in particular when on the move, including when they return. Limited access for personnel and equipment still causes difficulties in some mine action activities.

**Plan**

In November, the Cluster will finalize the technical reviews and recommendations for both the second standard 2017 HF allocation and of HRP projects. 

The 16 Days of Activism will take place from 25 Nov to 10th Dec with activities in Syria, especially in the WGSS and in Turkey. GBV SC will organize a 10 days training for GBV PSS actors working inside Syria on GBV basics, PSS, SOPs and Case Management.

Training of data collectors and piloting of CP monitoring toolkit. Outline key roles and responsibilities of the FTR technical group and draft key messages for government authorities in Ankara and provincial level.

2376784,"Norway’s engagement in global mine clearance 18 September 2017 was the 20th anniversary of the adoption in Oslo of the Mine Ban Convention.

Norway is one of the five largest donors to mine clearance efforts, together with the US, Japan, the EU and the Netherlands. Our high level of engagement relates to our commitments under the Mine Ban Convention and the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the importance we attach to mine clearance as a humanitarian concern, and our partnership with Norwegian People’s Aid (NPA). With funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPA has become one of the three largest humanitarian mine clearance organisations in the world.

The main priority for Norway is humanitarian mine clearance to protect civilians. This means that our funding is channelled through humanitarian organisations rather than commercial or military actors. We also work in direct partnership with mine clearance operators at country level rather than through multilateral channels. This year we are supporting efforts in a total of 20 countries through the HALO Trust (Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Colombia), the Mines Advisory Group (Iraq, Syria, Laos, and Lebanon) and Norwegian People’s Aid (in 18 countries).

A great deal has been achieved over the past 20 years. But at the same time, land mines and cluster munitions, both of which have been banned, have been used in new conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Eastern Ukraine and Yemen.

During the course of 2016, new, large-scale projects were launched in Colombia and Iraq. In February 2016, Norway and the US spearheaded a global anti-landmine initiative in Colombia as part of the peace process, and co-hosted an international donor conference in New York in September 2016 that mobilised pledges totalling about USD 100 million.

An increasing proportion of Norway’s efforts is directed to mine clearance in parts of Iraq and Syria that have been liberated from ISIL. The number of civilian victims is particularly high due to the widespread use of homemade explosives. Activities supported by Norway include identifying hazardous areas, training the local population in risk management, and clearing mines and explosive remnants of war to make it possible for internally displaced people to return.

Mine clearance in these parts of Syria and Iraq is extremely challenging, and depends on a long-term commitment on the part of donors and close coordination of international efforts.",12033,"Mine Action"
