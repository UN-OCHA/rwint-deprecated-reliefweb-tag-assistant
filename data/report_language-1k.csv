Over the 8 week period, from October 16 to December 10, the 5 most frequently reported diseases/syndromes were: unexplained fever (98 523 cases, 15.9%), acute respiratory infection (68 769 cases, 11.1%, with higher incidence rate among children less than 5 years old), acute watery diarrhoea (65 092 cases, 10.5%), and skin diseases (28 693 cases, 4.6%, with similar numbers of reported cases among both children aged under 5 and individuals aged 5 years and older).

Severe malnutrition was reported among 1518 patients, of which 88% were children aged under 5 years. 1860 patients presented with suspected measles or rubella, of which over 20% were among individuals aged five years and older. 

The frequency of respiratory infection, skin diseases and diarrhoea reflected in these reports is associated with poor living conditions with lack of essential hygiene and a high population density. The high number of patients presenting with injury, 6897, also needs to be investigated, as this may reflect poor living conditions that contribute to preventable morbidity.

“Other” conditions accounted for 318 661 cases (51.3% of all reported conditions), with 83% among people aged 5 years or older. Further investigation of this group will be conducted as a priority to assess the main causes of disease constituting this large category, in particular the incidence of non-communicable and/or chronic diseases that can lead to death if not treated (such as tuberculosis, diabetes and cardiac dysfunction), and psychiatric and psychological conditions that require specialized care.",267,"English"
2393504,"Diphtheria outbreak, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh - Daily epidemiological bulletin, 2017-12-26 _Epidemiological overview as of 25 Dec 2017_

_Time_

Between 8 Nov 2017 and 25 Dec 2017, 2440 suspected case-patients with diphtheria were reported in the settlements of forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals, Cox’s Bazar (Figure 1), 80 of which were reported on 25 Dec 2017 (Figure 2). Date of onset information is missing for 111 (4.5%) case-patients.

_Place_

Estimated attack rates (expressed as number of cases per 10,000 population) are shown in Figure 3. These estimates are based on population figures from 07 December 2017. N.B. due to difficulties in locating reported residence, only 1509 out of 2440 (61.8%) total casepatients have been included in the attack rate calculations, which therefore likely under-estimate the true attack rates. Efforts are ongoing to map these case-patients.

_Person_

**Age**

The age distribution of suspect case-patients shows that, approximately: one-quarter are among the 0-5 year age group, one-third are in the 5-10 year age group, and one-fifth are aged between 10-15 years (Figure 4). Importantly, 25.3% of the suspected case-patients are aged 15 years and older.

**Sex**

1090 (44.7%) of the case-patients are male, while 1337 (54.8%) of the case-patients are female (Figure 5). Information on sex was missing for 12 (0.5%) of case-patients. 

**Signs and symptoms prevalence**

There are 247 (10.1%) suspected case-patients without information on signs and symptoms. Of those suspected case-patients with this information, the prevalence of signs and symptoms is shown in Figure 6 (N.B. patients with no information are excluded from this analysis): 

**Outcomes**

There are 26 deaths recorded in the linelist thus far.

**Delay distributions**

The median [IQR] delay from symptom onset to presentation at health facilities was 2 [2 - 3] days. Among those who have died, the median [IQR] delay from symptom onset to death was 7 [4.25 - 10] days.

**Contacts**

Contact tracing and follow-up for chemo-prophylaxis is an important component of the outbreak response strategy. Close contacts are defined as “those sleeping in the same shelter or who have been directly exposed to nasopharyngeal secretions of the patient on a prolonged or regular basis (example, school classmates other patients in wards and medical staff)”.

There is no information on number of close contacts for 518 (21.2%) suspected case-patients. 

Among those case-patients for whom information is available on number of close contacts, the median [IQR] number of contacts is 5 [3 - 7], while the total range is 0-21 (Figure 7).",267,"English"

“2017 was a horrible year for the children of Yemen,” UNICEF Representative in the country, Meritxell Relaño, told UN News by telephone from the capital, Sana’a.

More than 80 children were killed or injured in December alone, while millions face a cholera epidemic, looming famine, a disruption in health services and a blockade hampering delivery of much-needed supplies.

She urged a political solution for what she said was a man-made conflict and warned that without a political solution many more children would die.

Ms. Relaño recounted meeting a woman and her dying 7-year-old son Ali in a hospital in Aden.

“He was like skin on bones. I asked why they had not come sooner and the mother told me that she could not afford to ride the bus to the hospital. The levels of poverty in the families [have] now reached levels that are unsustainable,” she said.

To offset some of this type of need, Ms. Relaño noted that some 1.3 million families, or about 8 million people, are being reached with emergency cash as part of a transfer project between UNICEF and the World Bank.

She also praised successful efforts to deliver vaccines and implement a polio immunization campaign this year to benefit some 5 million children and provide treatment for 200,000 children with acute malnutrition.

“Yemenis who work on the ground to support the Yemenis are the true heroes,” she said, noting the efforts of local authorities, doctors, nurses and teachers in the country.

Duque III today immediately ordered the augmentation of medicines and other medical supplies in regions hit by tropical storm “Vinta” in Mindanao to respond to the immediate health needs of thousands of affected families and communities. 

""The DOH expresses its sympathy to our countrymen on this tragic event especially with the loss of lives and with many still reported missing along with their homes which were destroyed by flash floods and landslides. This is very sad especially at this time when families should be celebrating Christmas and preparing for the festivities of the New Year,"" Duque lamented. The health chief also appealed to the public any assistance they can provide to those affected by the disaster.

Secretary Duque also reported that flash floods and landslide incidents occurred in Zamboanga del Norte, while the municipality of Carmen, Daval del Norte has now been declared under state of calamity. 

A total of 70,454 families or 320,180 individuals are affected in 569 barangays in MIMAROPA, Central Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Central Mindanao, Davao region, ARMM and CARAGA. 

At the moment, the Department of Health is still on alert and concerned regional offices are instructed to deploy emergency response teams to provide the needed health services to the affected population, and ordered continuous coordination with their respective Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils. 

Also, the DOH Davao regional office has emergency medical teams to Talomo North District, Marilog District, Bunangin District and District A to provide health consultations and treatments. DOH Central Visayas provided technical services on water sanitation, hygiene and nutrition services. 

The DOH Central Mindanao augmented assorted medicines to rural health units of Pantao Ragat and Balo-1 for internally-displaced people inside and outside of evacuation centers, started leptospirosis prophylaxis to exposed individuals, augmented doxycycline in Northern Mindanao Medical Center and provided health teachings on the proper use of water treatment solutions.

2393439,"Venezuela Situation Update, November 2017 The total number of Venezuelans in Colombia has more than doubled in less than four months, reaching 660,000 individuals, end-November, up from 300,000 in June.

Between January and October 2017 over 100.000 Venezuelan nationals have entered Peru through the northern entry point in Tumbes, according to authorities.

In Brazil 15,645 Venezuelans have lodged asylum claims in 2017, 1,680 Temporary Residence Permits have been granted and a total of 30,000 are estimated to live in the country.

**POPULATION OF CONCERN** 

- In November the movements from Venezuela to Colombia continued to grow, according to government figures that show net arrivals from Venezuelans reached 4,000 people per day (up from 3,500 in October), and 2,500 Colombian returnees per day. Colombian authorities also reported that some 200,000 have crossed into Ecuador. 

- Over 1 million Venezuelans have now registered for the Border Mobility Card (TMF) in Colombia. 

- In Peru 19,000 Venezuelans have applied for the Temporary Permanence Permit (PTP), Peruvian authorities estimate. Since August 4,000 PTPs have been issued out of that total. 

- At least 60,000 Venezuelans are estimated to be residing in the Southern Caribbean. 

- In Brazil some 15,000 of all Venezuelan asylum-claims have been lodged in Roraima border state since 2014, 2,500 in Amazonas state and some 590 in Sao Paulo.

**CONTEXT INFORMATION**

Over one million Venezuelans have left their country, according to host Government figures. Over 106,000 have sought asylum since 2014, more than half in 2017. Some 190,000 have also applied for alternative legal status across the region. They claim they are leaving for a variety of reasons, including threats by armed groups; fear of being targeted on account of their political opinion, real or perceived; insecurity and violence; lack of food, medicine and access to essential social services, as well as loss of income.

UNHCR has also identified hundreds of indigenous people crossing the borders, primarily into Colombia and Brazil. These groups sometimes travel long distances by land and have shown to be highly vulnerable as they do not have the financial resources to buy food or shelter. Additional support has been provided to them.

While the dialogue between the Government and the opposition coalition has restarted in the Dominican Republic, people continue to steadily leave the country. The socio-economic situation increasingly deteriorates and inflation has made it extremely difficult to access food, medicine, basic products and services. Reports from international organizations state that there is a considerable number of people with chronic malnutrition in the country, as well as a shortage of medicine. As a result of the strained resources, insecurity has also been increasing and having a rising impact on peoples’ lives.

**Operational Context**

**Brazil**

- The Government of Roraima has declared a state of social emergency due to the “intense, unlimited and disorderly flow of Venezuelans without means or conditions to sustain themselves” that arrive from Venezuela. Local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to provide an adequate security and health response, as well as to implement the recent government resolution that establishes standard operation procedures for the protection of unaccompanied and separated children, based on the recommendations by UNHCR.

- Among the reasons given by the Warao for leaving Venezuela, is that the government’s support to indigenous communities in the country has ceased. They claim that there are no available schools, health centres or services. Water distribution, usually their only source of potable water, has allegedly also stopped. The Warao also stated that they suffered discrimination in the access to ID- documents, which could help explain the considerable amount of Warao without identification arriving in Brazil.

- The Warao continue to move inward, confirming their intent to stay. Over 200 Warao are living in Pará state. The majority is living on the streets, while some 70 people are staying in a rural school set up as a temporary shelter by the Municipality. Following UNHCR’s counsel, Amazonas and Pará authorities created a formal communication channel to exchange experiences and lessons learned.

**Colombia**

- Armed groups activities at the Colombian-Venezuela border, incursions by the Venezuelan military into Colombia, confrontations between governments and the lack of capacity to control the actions of armed actors on both sides of the border are increasing risks for persons of concern in these areas. UNHCR continues to monitor the reports of violence at the border.

- In October, a pamphlet was distributed in Arauca by the “Araucan Social Cleansing Group”, accusing Venezuelan men of selling drugs to children and committing crimes and Venezuelan women of being prostitutes, and called for them to go back to Venezuela or face assassination.

- Colombian authorities are concerned about the spread of diseases including malaria, measles, diphtheria and tuberculosis in reception areas. They state that due to a lack of health access in Venezuela, arrivals are boosting transmission rates. More than 19,000 Venezuelans have received emergency treatment in Colombia, increasing pressure on local services. The Government is working with the Red Cross and WHO/PAHO to increase services, and UNHCR is advocating to ensure a protection-sensitive approach.

- The Special Stay Permit (PEP) application deadline expired on 31 October. Over 67,000 Venezuelans applied for the permit, which allows them to regularize their status, work and access basic services for up to two years in Colombia. UNHCR is advocating for this measure to be extended to ensure that legal pathways remain open, as is the case in other countries in the region.",267,"English"

PRC Chairman Richard Gordon made the appeal as figures on the number of deaths and missing people from the flashfloods and landslides that struck parts of Mindanao continue to rise in the wake of ‘Vinta’.

“Rural communities, which are in remote mountainous areas, are the hardest hit. Some villages are swept away by surging current of mud and water. We’re really in our toes right now. We’re trying to figure out how to bring our help closer to our people who are suffering right now” Gordon said. 

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) on Monday reported at least 164 people dead, while 171 remain missing. Majority of which are due to flashfloods and mudslides in the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Verification and validation from local government authorities are still ongoing.

“The focus at the moment is to find those who are still missing and to alleviate the suffering of those who survived. Slowly but surely, you can be sure the Red Cross will continue to be there for the people affected,” he said.

Gordon said the PRC will be immediately distributing P3,000 cash grants to 1,500 families from worst-hit communities. The priority will be the most vulnerable such as those who lost a family member and single parents.

“This is the fastest way we can bring assistance to our people. People are hungry before, now they are hungrier because of the typhoon. We want to give hope again to our people,” he added.

The PRC through the support of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will be distributing 1,000 non-food items in the coming days.

He added that more water tankers would be sent to provide clean water to the affected communities. 

Those with missing family members would also be assisted PRC’s Restoring Family Links Program

HÀ NỘI — More than 1.1 million people in 15 provinces and cities in the south of Việt Nam have been evacuated to safety as Typhoon Tembin approaches, with the storm forecast to land in the coastal area from Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu to Cà Mau provinces early today.

The Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue and the Border Guard Command provided information on the storm’s movements to more than 69,000 vehicles.

The storm is moving west at a speed of 15-20km per hour and is forecast to be off the waters of Trà Vinh to Cà Mau at about 7am today. Wind speeds hit 75-90km per hour, according to the National Hydrometeorological Forecast Centre.

The storm is projected to keep moving west for the next 12-24 hours and gradually weaken into a tropical depression. The eye of the depression is forecast to be off the Gulf of Thailand at 7pm today.

The typhoon has already affected some localities which have experienced rains up to 50mm from yesterday evening.

The centre also warned of flash floods and landslides in some areas from Quảng Ngãi to Bình Thuận, Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu and Kiên Giang due to heavy rains and rising seawater.

Localities in the south have taken various measures to prepare for the storm.

Côn Đảo District and Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province have called for all vessels operating in Côn Đảo’s waters to return to safety. All tourists on the island have been evacuated to shelters.

Nguyễn Văn Dũng, vice chairman of the People’s Committee of Côn Đảo District, said the province has instructed forces to call on fishermen to return to storm shelters.

The Mekong Delta province of Sóc Trăng has evacuated more than 30,000 people to safe places while calling for nearly 1,200 vessels operating offshore to find shelter.

The province’s leaders have directed agencies, forces and households to speed up the harvest of shrimp and rice to avoid storm damage.

Tiền Giang Province also evacuated nearly 35,000 people in high risks areas to safer places. Thousands of soldiers were mobilised to strengthen the dyke system and houses.

Many localities have allowed pupils to stay home from schools and industrial zone workers to be off work.

2393344,"Mine Action and Confidence-Building: Harnessing Trust for Conflict Prevention in Colombia _Adriana Erthal Abdenur, in San Vicente del Caguán, Caquetá, Colombia_

Christmas preparations are in full swing at the church offices in San Vicente del Caguán, in the department of Caquetá.  Groups of children sit cross-legged on the patio, cutting stars out of shiny construction paper and hanging ornaments on the bushes.  In a small meeting room, I sit down to speak with Sonia (not her real name), one of the community leaders for mine action.

Sonia is young, but—like San Vicente as a whole—exhausted by war.  In the early 2000s, San Vicente became the epicenter of a [failed peace process](http://centromemoria.gov.co/proceso-de-paz-del-caguan/)between the FARC and the government, in which the creation of a cease-fire zone allowed the guerrilla to regroup.  To stop the Army operations in the area, the guerrilla planted hundreds of anti-personnel mines around the town and its surrounding fields.  The area remains one of the most intensely contaminated areas of Colombia (itself among the countries with the highest number of landmines and explosive remnants of war, ERW). Coming into San Vicente, I had seen the demining operations by the side of the road, with Army specialists in full protective gear perched tensely over small squares of soil, patiently combing the soil for casings.   My local guide had pointed at the dense overgrowth covering vast fields–fertile land left fallow due to the suspicion there are still landmines.

Since the final agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC was signed, in December 2016, demining efforts have intensified in this part of Colombia, with [the Army and eight agencies](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/municipios-asignados.aspx) working in priority areas.  Yet accidents continue to happen.  The day before my visit with Sonia, a farmer had one of his legs blown off under the knee when he stepped on a mine in a nearby field.  “He was airlifted by the Army,” says Sonia, noting that his community just recently had been identified for mine action.

Sonia recounts the successes, but also mentions the need to build confidence.  The government broadcasts images of villagers playing football matches on decontaminated fields, but in reality the locals won’t step on that land until they have tested it the old-fashioned way: by sending their cattle to graze on it.“  I ask Sonia whether she herself would walk across one of the demined fields. She pauses. “No.”

When asked why, she reminds me that decontaminated land is said to be free of suspicion of mines, rather than free of mines, and that there is still work to be done on build the local population’s confidence in the process. The impact of mines/ERW is predicated not only on the destructive, even lethal capacity of the explosives, but also on the more generalized fear that vital areas may be contaminated, which prevent entire communities from cultivating land, building essential infrastructure, or accessing vital resources. While it takes little effort to spread fear through mines, [substantial investment is required in trust and confidence-building](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12096848) to minimize that fear.

Yet peace process stakeholders and peacebuilders can also leverage this link between mines and trust to create new dialogue spaces, both during peace talks and during their implementation. Demining, in other words, can present unique opportunities for confidence building among warring parties, in part because mine clearance is often needed in order to implement a local ceasefire or other localized actions even during negotiations. In the FARC process, for instance, demining became the first bilateral point in de-escalation, in order to implement a local cease-fire.   Demining thus required that the Colombian military and the FARC guerrillas collaborate directly, setting a precedent for further cooperation.   Demining, in fact, became one of the main topics around which the agreements were organized, and [is the object of an entire agreement](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/acuerdo/Paginas/Acuerdo-sobre-limpieza-y-descontaminacion.aspx).

After the final agreement was signed, in December 2017, humanitarian mine action (HMA) was among the immediate priorities. A body was set up to [issue a strategy](http://www.accioncontraminas.gov.co/accion/desminado/Paginas/Desminado-Humanitario.aspx) and guidelines following international standards, and the Colombian demining oversight body began working with eight demining agencies (as well as the Organization for American States) to survey, map, and demine vast priority areas.

For locals in the countryside—the areas most directly affected by the conflict—one major trust issue relates to the effectiveness of demining, especially when different types of artifacts are buried at different depths. But trust also implies the credibility of institutions, from the agencies to the government bodies overseeing them. In turn, attaining this confidence requires building an ongoing relationship with local actors, at both individual and institutional levels. As in many other contexts, demining agencies working in Colombia carry out non-technical surveys that include consultations with local communities, and that incorporate locals—including women—into their teams.  Demining agencies are also required to establish an _enlace_—a key person that links the agency and the community and that facilitates the flow of information in both directions. When properly established and maintained, these channels allow for the community to voice concerns from beginning to end of process.

Equally important are the level and capacity of community’s own proactive involvement in the process.  In parts of Colombia, local and regional groups have become proactive in mine action, especially in awareness-raising efforts and in identifying demands and concerns.  This participation allows communities to become familiar with the modus operandi of different agencies. Ideally, it can also create communication channels across communities on the demining process, helping to identify challenges and share solutions.

However, there is still work to be done. In this part of Colombia, community leaders complain that there are not enough _enlaces_.  This gap undercuts the exchange of information, which is vital not only to the agencies (which rely in part on popular knowledge to identify mined areas) but also to the communities, who continue to suffer casualties and live in fear even as mine action efforts are undertaken elsewhere.  In some instances, agencies can undermine trust.  Near her hometown, notes Sonia, one agency has divulged who planted the explosives. “This information can reignite resentment among groups,” she notes. “We need to demine without focusing on who did what, otherwise it becomes hard to break the cycle of distrust and resentment.”

Matching agencies to local communities can also be part of this process.  The agreement with the FARC establishes that [ex-combatants also participate in demining](http://caracol.com.co/radio/2017/02/04/nacional/1486166835_366877.html). Sonia assures me that there are communities in Caquetá that in fact would prefer to have the ex-combatants decontaminating their land.  “They know one another,” she says. “And you can’t demine without trust.”

2393199,"Syria: Eastern Ghouta Situation Overview - Rural Damascus, Syria - November 2017 **Executive Summary**

Eastern Ghouta is an agricultural region east of Damascus that is home to approximately 400,000 people. The area has faced access restrictions since the beginning of the Syrian conflict and was classified by the United Nations (UN) as besieged in 2013. Since September 2017, the humanitarian situation in this area has deteriorated significantly. This Situation Overview, which is based on interviews conducted remotely with Community Representatives, builds on a previous product from October to investigate how conditions developed in November.  
Access to Eastern Ghouta improved slightly in November. Commercial movement into the area resumed, after no commercial deliveries reportedly took place in September or October. A number of humanitarian aid deliveries took place, and aid that entered in October was distributed. However, these deliveries were insufficient to counter the unprecedented price increases in Eastern Ghouta. In November, a standard food basket was reportedly 911% more expensive than in nearby areas not considered besieged or hard-to-reach. Basic commodities such as salt and sugar were respectively 14,129% and 4,556% more expensive than in nearby areas. Deaths due to malnutrition and a lack of food also continued to be reported.  
Eastern Ghouta also continued to face severe shortages of fuel and medicine in November,
as both types of items only entered the area in very small proportions. The lack of fuel has had a negative impact on the availability of a number of services, such as transportation, water, medical care and electricity. Residents reportedly coped by burning plastic to make fuel. Existing stockpiles of medical items also continued to be depleted rapidly.  
The area continued to suffer from conflict-related violence in November. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals were reportedly struck by shelling4, which led to the suspension of all educational activities. In order to limit their exposure to aerial attacks, residents reportedly restricted their own movement.  
Due to the high food prices and shortage of fuel, residents are ill-prepared for the remainder of the winter season. Unless access restrictions on Eastern Ghouta ease, it is unlikely that humanitarian conditions will improve.",267,"English"
2393194,"Solar power brings light to Congolese refugees in Angola **LOUVA, Angola** – Since the outbreak of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kasai region earlier this year, nearly 35,000 refugees have poured into Angola’s Lunda Norte Province.

The population is highly vulnerable. Some 75 per cent of refugees from Kasai are women and children, according to UN reports. Many refugees have reported witnessing mass killings, rape and other human rights abuses during their flight from conflict.

Ester, 25, recounted the frenzy of her departure. “It was the day when the war arrived to our village. They were killing people. I was not able to take anything with me, only my children,” she said.

Humanitarian groups are working to relocate many of the refugees from the Cacanda reception centre to a new settlement in Lóvua.

The new location allows the refugees to have some privacy and space for farming, but it is not connected to an electrical grid, so the refugees are left in total darkness when the sun sets – a problem for their safety and security.

Ester’s family recently moved into the settlement. “We are living in the bush. I do not have any lamps, and no light. It makes me feel afraid,” she said. “There is, for example, no light for us to be able to go to the toilet during night.” 

**Darkness poses risks**

Around the world, women and girls report being threatened or assaulted when leaving home at night to relieve themselves or manage their menstrual hygiene. These risks are elevated in crisis settings, when social safety nets, law enforcement and other protection mechanisms break down.

Darkness poses other risks as well. Women who go into labour at night, for example, may have trouble getting to clinics or being properly treated without a reliable light source.

“Light is important to help maintain the safety and rights of women and adolescents at night,” said Florbela Fernandes, UNFPA’s representative in Angola.

**Portable sunshine**

UNFPA is working with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to provide 50 solar-powered units to community centres, medical facilities and other communal spaces in the Lóvua refugee settlement. 

The units, donated by Panasonic, consist of a solar panel, three LED lamps, and a rechargeable battery that can also be used to charge mobile phones.

“We hope these solar lamps can be installed in public facilities to be able to extend the services and provide light in the dark,” said Yuzo Kitamoto, deputy representative for the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Angola, after a visit to Lóvua in December.

Women and girls arriving in Lóvua are also receiving solar-powered torches, part of the dignity kits that are a standard part of UNFPA’s humanitarian response. Some 2,000 dignity kits – which contain hygiene items such as soap, underwear and sanitary napkins – are being handed out, with more on the way. 

UNFPA is additionally partnering with the UN Refugee Agency to deliver solar street lights to the settlement. And in partnership with Médicos del Mundo, UNFPA has set up women-friendly spaces, where women and girls can rest, socialize, and learn where to receive reproductive health services and help for survivors of gender-based violence.

As for Ester, she is determined to move forward. “I hope for a good life with my family here in Angola,” she said. “I am too afraid to return now.”

2393149,"Libya Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) - December 2017 **Introduction**

In an effort to better understand market dynamics in Libya, the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) was initiated by the Libya Cash & Markets Working Group (CMWG) in June 2017. The initiative is guided by the CMWG Markets Taskforce, led by REACH and supported by the CMWG members.

Markets in key urban areas across Libya are assessed on a monthly basis. In each location, field teams record prices and availability of basic food and nonfood items (NFI) sold in local shops and markets.

This factsheet presents an overview of price ranges and medians for key foods and NFIs in the assessed areas. The cleaned data sets are available on the REACH Resource Centre and distributed to CMWG partners, as well as to the broader humanitarian community.

In future rounds, the factsheet will include a Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB), which represents the minimum culturally adjusted group of items required to support a Libyan household for one month. The prices associated with the SMEB will illustrate variations in prices across assessed locations. The SMEB will be included once it has been agreed upon by all partners and may not contain all items assessed in the previous rounds.",267,"English"

Following the [recommitment to cease fire](https://reliefweb.int/node/2390589), the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations in Donetsk region and a similar number of ceasefire violations in Luhansk region between the evenings of 22 and 23 December compared with the previous reporting period. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations in Donetsk region compared with the previous 24 hours and no ceasefire violations in Luhansk region. The SMM recorded more ceasefire violations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions between the evenings of 24 and 25 December compared with the previous 24 hours, but fewer compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December. The Mission followed up on reports of a civilian injured along the contact line near Berezove and observed damage to residential areas of Pavlopil and Yasynuvata assessed as caused by shelling. The SMM continued monitoring the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske; it recorded a ceasefire violation inside the Stanytsia Luhanska area. The SMM’s access remained restricted in all three areas and elsewhere, including at two “DPR” weapons storage sites. The Mission observed weapons in violation near Poltavka. The SMM visited five border areas beyond government control. In Kyiv, the SMM monitored four gatherings in the city centre.

In Donetsk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 of December, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations[1], including about 200 explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (about 320 explosions). About 40 per cent of these violations, including about 140 explosions, were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December, mostly in the area between government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk) and “DPR”-controlled Debaltseve (58km north-east of Donetsk). Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded a significant decrease in the number of ceasefire violations, including fewer explosions (18), compared with the previous 24 hours. Between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, although the SMM recorded more ceasefire violations (including 14 explosions) compared with the previous 24 hours, there were significantly fewer ceasefire violations compared with the period between the evenings of 22 and 23 December.

Between the evening and midnight on 22 December, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, nine projectiles in flight from west to east and two projectiles from east to west, followed by a total of two undetermined explosions and 42 projectiles (42 from west to east and one from east to west), all 1-3km south.

In Luhansk region, between the evenings of 22 and 23 December, the SMM recorded a similar number of ceasefire violations, but more explosions (six) compared with the previous reporting period (no explosions). Almost all ceasefire violations were recorded between 00:00 and 19:30 on 23 December. Between the evenings of 23 and 24 December, the SMM recorded no ceasefire violations; between the evenings of 24 and 25 December, the SMM recorded an explosion and a shot of small-arms fire.

During the day on 23 December, positioned 1km north-west of “LPR”-controlled Depreradivka (65km west of Luhansk), the SMM heard five undetermined explosions and six bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 5-7km north-west.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the south-western edge of “LPR”-controlled Molodizhne (63km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an undetermined explosion at least 5km south-west.

On 23 December, a “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Oleksandrivka (20km south-west of Donetsk) told the SMM that a senior “DPR” member had issued an “order” to all “DPR”‑members of the armed formations to comply with the recommitment to the ceasefire and not to return fire. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the Joint Centre for Control and Co‑operation (JCCC) in Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk) told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire and that Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the area had also been informed. On 24 December, an armed “DPR” member in “DPR”-controlled Pikuzy (formerly Kominternove, 23km north of Mariupol) told the SMM that “DPR” members in the area were aware of the recommitment to cease fire. In government-controlled Lebedynske (16km north-east of Mariupol), an officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told the SMM that he was aware of the recommitment to cease fire.

The SMM followed up on media reports of a civilian casualty. On 23 December, a Ukrainian Armed Forces soldier told the SMM that a man (71 years old) had triggered a booby trap while off the paved surface north of a checkpoint near Berezove (31km south-west of Donetsk) on 21 December. A volunteer paramedic, who said he had been working nearby at the time of the incident, told the SMM that the man had gone into the vegetation off the road when he tripped the booby trap, which had left his chest and left leg penetrated by metal fragments. Medical staff at the hospital in government-controlled Volnovakha (53km south of Donetsk), where the man was taken, showed the SMM X-rays which, according to the staff, showed approximately 15-20 fragments embedded in the man’s left leg, hip, and chest.

The SMM observed damage to civilian properties in residential areas. On 23 December, approximately 250m south-east of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street in government-controlled Pavlopil (26km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed a fresh crater, assessed as caused by an artillery shell (122mm) fired from an east-north-easterly direction. The SMM observed power lines cut about 75m south of the crater and saw a piece of shrapnel consistent with an artillery shell lodged in the outer pane of a south-facing window of the house at 34 Yuvileina Street. A resident of the house told the SMM that she had heard a loud explosion south-east of her home shortly after 22:00 on 22 December and immediately thereafter lost power. A resident of another house on the same street also told the SMM that he had lost power to his house shortly after hearing a loud explosion just after 22:00 on 22 December.

At 55 Karla Marksa Street in Yasynuvata, the SMM saw a fresh crater 3m south of the property’s entrance gate. The SMM saw fresh shrapnel marks on the gate, fence and south-facing wall of the house and assessed the impact as caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. The owner of the property (man in his seventies) told the SMM that the impact that caused the crater had occurred at 21:45 on 20 December.

At 51 Karla Marksa Street, the SMM saw two fresh craters 3m south and 7m north of a house, as well as four south-facing windows shattered and the south-facing walls scarred by shrapnel. The north-facing wall of the house was destroyed. The SMM assessed the wall to have been destroyed by the blast wave of the impact north of the house. The SMM assessed the impact to have been caused by an artillery round (at least 122mm) fired from a north-westerly direction. One of the house’s residents (man in his seventies) told the SMM that shelling had started at around 22:00 on 20 December and that he, his wife and two minor grandchildren had been inside the house at the time.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 21 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded a projectile in flight from south to north (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area).

On the evening of 22 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded an explosion assessed as an impact of an artillery round about 4km east (assessed as outside the disengagement area). On the morning of 23 December, positioned on the eastern edge of “LPR”-controlled Pervomaisk (58km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an explosion and saw smoke rising assessed as the detonation of unexploded ordnance (UXO) 500-700m south-west and outside the disengagement area.

During the day on 25 December, positioned on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge (15km north-east of Luhansk), the SMM heard a shot of small-arms fire 500m north-west, assessed as inside the disengagement area.

During the day on 23 December, positioned near the Stanytsia Luhanska and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 24 December, positioned near all three disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation. On 25 December, positioned near the Zolote and Petrivske disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in a government-controlled area, the SMM observed four multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) (BM-21 Grad, 122mm) near Poltavka (54km north-west of Donetsk) on 23 December.

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, the SMM observed a tank (type unknown) loaded on a flatbed truck in Rubizhne (84km north-west of Luhansk) and a surface-to-air missile system (9K33 Osa) in the outskirts of Klynove (68km north-east of Donetsk) on 25 December.

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw noted ten MLRS (BM-21) were missing for the first time 23 December; it also saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm), five towed mortars (2B9 Vasilek, 82mm) (three for the first time) and seven towed howitzers (2A36 Giatsint-B, 152mm) (all seven for the first time) on 24 December. In non-government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1) and noted a mortar (2B11 Sani, 120mm) and 12 towed mortars (PM-38, 120mm) were again missing.

The SMM revisited a permanent storage site in an area outside government control in Donetsk region, whose location was beyond the respective withdrawal lines, and noted that eight tanks (three T-64 and five T-72) were again missing. The SMM was denied access to another permanent storage site in a “DPR”-controlled area as its gates were locked and no one was present to open them.*

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles (ACV) and anti-aircraft guns[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, the SMM saw five infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (BMP-1) near Popasna (69km west of Luhansk) on 22 December; nine IFVs (BMP-1), an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) mounted to a military-type truck, an ACV (type unknown) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM‑1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna, as well as an APC (BTR-70) and an armoured reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk) on 23 December; ten IFVs (BMP-variants), four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (BRM‑1K), a self-propelled anti-aircraft system (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 23mm) and an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23) near Popasna, as well as a combat engineering vehicle (IMR-2) near Bezhynove (45km north-west of Luhansk) on 24 December; and seven IFVs (BMP-variants) and four armoured reconnaissance vehicles (three BRM 1K and one BRDM-2) near Popasna on 25 December.

In non-government-controlled areas, the SMM observed an APC (BTR-70) near Petrivske on 24 December.

The SMM continued to observe the presence of mine hazard signs. At a checkpoint at the southern end of “DPR”-controlled Sakhanka (24km north-east of Mariupol), the SMM observed that two mines signs had been placed on a concrete barrier which had the message “No Passage” written on it in Russian. Although the concrete barrier was on the road, the SMM observed traffic driving around it. In front of the Ukrainian Armed Forces compound northwest of government-controlled Nadezhdynka (61km west of Donetsk), the SMM saw a 30x50cm rectangular wooden sign with a white background and black painted letters with “Danger Mines” written on it in Ukrainian.

The SMM visited five border areas not under government control. On 23 December, during about 40 minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Verkhnoharasymivka (57km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM saw 14 pedestrians exiting Ukraine and six pedestrians entering. On 23 December, during about 30 minutes at the pedestrian border crossing point near Novoborovytsi (79km south of Luhansk), the SMM observed a pedestrian entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about one hour at a border crossing point near Dovzhanske (84km south-east of Luhansk), the SMM observed 20 cars, four buses and nine pedestrians exiting Ukraine, as well as 20 civilian cars (three with “LPR” plates), a bus, a covered cargo truck and 11 pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about 45 minutes at a border crossing point near Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed a covered cargo truck and five cars (two with “DPR” plates) exiting Ukraine, as well as 19 cars (eight with “DPR” plates), two covered cargo trucks with “DPR” plates and two pedestrians entering Ukraine. On 25 December, during about ten minutes at a pedestrian border crossing point near Ulianivske (61km south-east of Donetsk), the SMM observed no pedestrians entering or exiting Ukraine.

In Kyiv, the SMM monitored gatherings in the city centre. On 24 December, between 12:00 and 14:00, the SMM saw up to 1,500 people (men and women, mixed ages) gathered at Independence Square. The gathering was held following a call on social media by an ATO veteran critical of the ongoing protest near the Parliament building. (See SMM Daily Report 19 December 2017.) The SMM saw no more than ten police officers near the square. The SMM also saw three other groups of people chanting slogans critical of the Government, including a group of about 25 men (aged 50-60) among the abovementioned crowd and another group of about 20 men (aged 20-40) near the square, and a third group of 25 people (mostly men, aged 20-60) in Shevchenko Park. The Mission saw the third group had marched from the park to Khreshchatyk Street. All gatherings ended without incidents.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro and Chernivtsi.",267,"English"
2393129,"Colombia War-Crime Prisoners Face Past, Plan Future *In a Bogotá military prison, former soldiers encounter conflict resolution as they seek to rebuild lives.*

Tuesday, December 26, 2017 / BY: Aubrey Cox; Maria Antonia Montes  
PUBLICATION TYPE: In the Field  

The prisoners would be arriving soon and Adriana Combita, like a young teacher preparing to greet a new class, was nervous. This was not the first time that Combita, 26, had led a peacebuilding training with soldiers convicted of war-related crimes. But these were senior officers, commanders with master’s degrees, military officials who had lived abroad.

As they entered the classroom on the Puente Aranda military base in central Bogotá, some of the prisoners displayed a wary tension. Others slid into their seats and leaned back, looking relaxed. The 16 men made small talk while scanning the room to see who had shown up. Four of them still wore military fatigues. The rest were dressed in civilian clothing, a sign that the military or national police had severed them from service because of the severity of their crimes. Combita reviewed her agenda and taped diagrams on a white board.

The majority of the prisoners didn’t know what to expect, but they did know why they volunteered to be here: Before long, they will be given the option to tell their stories to a tribunal of magistrates established under the peace [accords](https://www.usip.org/blog/2017/09/colombia-peace-year-life-new-accord-farc) that ended 52 years of war between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC.) This classroom is a place to learn how to tell it.

The tribunal, which could recommend reduced sentences for the prisoners in exchange for the complete truth, forms part of an innovative transitional justice system known as the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP). Its mandate is to investigate and document serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the armed conflict, and to prosecute, judge and sanction the perpetrators of those crimes. The JEP is also responsible for presenting Colombian society with the truth of what happened in the conflict and addressing the rights of victims.  

Its aim is to help reweave Colombia’s social fabric.

**Generation Change**

Using knowledge and skills derived from the U.S. Institute of Peace’s [Generation Change Fellows Program](https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/06/colombian-youth-bolster-peace-accord-new-skills)(GCFP), Combita will help the men reflect on their lives and on how their actions in Colombia’s war affected others. They will learn new strategies to communicate and to engage with people from different backgrounds and experiences through channels other than violence.

Combita, whose direct but caring manner sets up an easy rapport with the prisoners, is a youth leader working on prison projects for the Internal Action Foundation. Before her Generation Change experience, she worked mostly with women prisoners, helping them develop entrepreneurship skills that might allow them to earn a living when they’re released. After participating in a training for Generation Change Fellows in March, Combita met a group of women leading trainings for imprisoned fighters from the FARC and a smaller insurgent group, the National Liberation Army. Inspired by those women, and her Generation Change experience, she decided to change her focus to conflict resolution and peacebuilding.

At the military facilities, she is helping to improve the prisoners’ ability to speak about their experiences in the war and to contribute to the JEP’s goals of truth, justice and reparation—in effect, preparing them for the JEP process. The military has given the program welcome access to its prisons.

This first session of the October 23 training lasts well beyond its scheduled two hours. In one structured exercise, Combita asks the men to reflect on the positive and negative aspects of their lives. For 10 minutes they silently draw “rivers” of their lives with positive and negative shorelines.

Many of the men, who range in age from 18 to the mid-50s, discuss their careers as a positive. Negatives include the armed conflict, the death of family members caused by it and their imprisonment. Most talk about “Dios supremo”—God supreme—as an ally throughout their journey and their families as providing stability throughout their sentences. They say the peace process that ended the conflict and the approval of the JEP are positives that they hope will allow them to tell their truth and feel some sense of release.

In other exercises, they talk about the incidents, people and places that shaped the trajectory of their lives and reflect on the experiences that landed them in prison. The objective is, in part, to [connect](https://www.usip.org/programs/mediation-colombia) to other people in a new, more human way.

“I know that what we’re doing and talking about today will help me in the future,” said one of the ex-soldiers. “I would have liked to have this type of training when I first arrived in prison. It could have helped me understand my colleagues, to help ourselves be better, understand myself and how I got here.”

**FARC and Soldiers**

Combita has already held 16 sessions applying GCFP’s lessons on prejudice awareness and reduction, conflict management and leadership development in prisons for women, [guerrillas](https://www.usip.org/publications/2016/11/gender-and-role-women-colombias-peace-process) and soldiers and police in Cartagena, Cali, and two other facilities in Bogotá.

Combita developed the prison engagements to help prepare the inmates for the JEP, considered by many the backbone of the peace accords and a critical component of the larger Integrated System of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition. Its success will largely depend on the engagement of civil society actors like her.

The JEP will handle the cases of people who participated directly in the armed conflict including military and security personnel and the FARC, though indirect participants may also appear before the JEP voluntarily. In exchange for verifiable full disclosure of all critical facts and complete cooperation with investigations, those accepting responsibility for human rights violations can benefit from reduced and alternative sentences, which may include community service. As of November, more than 1,700 members of the armed forces had applied to go through the JEP, and 3,491 FARC had inscribed as well.

Efforts to establish the JEP have progressed slowly in the first year since the accord with the FARC despite significant resistance from Colombia’s political opposition.

**Human Rights Experience**

In September, following an exhaustive review process, a selection committee picked 38 judges to lead the judicial mechanism.

Two months later, after Congress added hotly contested amendments to the JEP law including one barring magistrates with human rights experience from participating, a statute detailing the specific mandate and functioning of the program was approved. If it passes muster with the Constitutional Court early next year, the Peace Tribunals may finally become operational as early as the second half of 2018.

In the meantime, Combita and her allies press ahead because the prison engagements are critical to restoring relationships between civil society and the sector and moving Colombia closer to a [durable peace](https://www.usip.org/publications/2016/06/qa-colombia-cease-fire-accord-marks-historic-turn).

“Sometimes as men, we have a hard time reflecting on the past, and being okay with crying and letting go, and allowing ourselves to know each other better and grow closer, despite our circumstances,” said one of the prisoners as the session wrapped up. “What we’re doing here is beautiful.”",267,"English"
2393124,"Driven from their lands, Colombia’s Awá struggle to survive By Michelle Begue in Villa Garzon, Colombia  | 

**Back on their ancestral lands in the Colombian rainforest, Awá Mayasquer elder Cuasaluzan Nastacuas hunted, raised livestock and planted food crops.**

But uprooted by the country’s bloody armed conflict, the 63-year-old now gets up each day at three in the morning to find work as a day labourer in a provincial city half-an- hour away by bus. 

“When we lived in the jungle … we worked on the land, planting yucca and raising pigs. We never worked in the city before being displaced,” his son Armando Cuasulzan Pai explains.

Indigenous peoples like the Awá Mayasquer are among those most impacted by more than five decades of armed conflict in Colombia that has displaced more than 7.6 million people both within the country and beyond its borders.

The community, whose lands are in Nariño province in southwest Colombia, were caught in the crossfire between government forces and left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

While a peace agreement in 2016 ended hostilities, the painful memory of rebel massacres that killed at least 11 in 2009, and the fear of landmines, make the community reluctant to return to their traditional home.

“The elders don’t even want to consider going back. They say they’d rather die here than be forced to go back. We decided to stay here and asked for relocation, for security reasons,” says Armando, who the leader of his community.

One of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world, Colombia is home to 102 different indigenous groups. But up to a third, including the Awá, are at risk of extinction because of the conflict and related displacement, according to Colombia’s Constitutional Court.

“You have to understand that their life is based around the group,” says Harold Juajibioy, a UNHCR staffer who works with the Awá. “When the armed conflict arrives in their lands the first thing that suffers is their sense of unity. It isn’t just a harming an individual, but harming a community.”

**“When the armed conflict arrives in their lands the first thing that suffers is their sense of unity.”**

In 2011 the Constitutional Court called for the adoption of precautionary measures to protect the group. And in April last year – after six years of internal displacement - 17 displaced Awá families were given 239 hectares of land by the government in the municipality of Villagarzon, in southern Colombia’s Putumayo region, to start over.

The resettled families, the first to be relocated there by the government, have gradually built elevated wooden shacks to live in. But their new homes lack running water, flushing toilets and electricity, and have black plastic trash bags covering most of the roofs to protect them from the heavy wet season rains.

“What does this Indigenous community need? Not just territory, we need housing, energy, water, running water in order to live, and livelihood projects so we can grow food. The government has really neglected us,” says Armando.

To get back on their feet, Armando says the community needs financial support to sow food crops and purchase cattle. “That is why it has been hard for us here. Some days we eat, other days we get by on a just a little coffee. That’s the situation we are living in,” he says.

While living conditions are hard, displacement for indigenous communities means more than just a loss of land. “Many times, out of fear or as a way to protect themselves, they don’t use their native language outside of their land,” says Juajibioy. “Because of discrimination in urban places, those cultural traditions, customs and rituals usually begin to disappear or deteriorate,” he adds.

While most of the homes in Villagarzon are not finished, one small but well-built wooden house stands in the middle of these lands. It is their cultural centre – built by the UN Refugee Agency - decorated and painted with the emblem of their planned indigenous reservation.   

A marimba - a percussion instrument built from bamboo – has been placed in the centre for the community to play. “We brought the marimba from Nariño,” says Armando, “The elders taught me to play it. And now I teach my sons, so that our culture can continue.”

The sun is setting and Ignacio Cuasaluzan has just come back from Mocoa, 18 kilometers Awáy. He made 25 thousand pesos in a long day’s work, the equivalent of US$8. It is just enough to pay for 12 kilos of rice which he will use to feed some members of his family. He joins his children to listen as Armando plays the marimba.

“We lived connected to nature,” he says wistfully. “We hear the birds sing and our marimba music complements the birdsong.”",267,"English"

2393069,"UNHCR Europe Monthly Report (November 2017) **TRENDS AND KEY FIGURES**

Between 1 January 2017 and 30 November 2017, 171,300 refugees and migrants arrived by sea and land to Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain and Cyprus only, including arrivals to the Canary Islands and by land to Spain). While sea arrivals to Europe in November were 51% lower than last year, largely due to fewer people crossing from Libya, higher numbers crossed from Libya in November than in October while Spain recorded the highest number of land and sea arrivals this year. 

As of 30 November, over 117,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Italy by sea in 2017 with just over 21,800 crossing in the past four months compared to over 95,200 in the first seven months of the year. As of the end of November, sea arrivals to Italy were 32% lower than during the first 11 months of 2016. Arrivals to Italy this year have included 15,540 unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) who comprised 13% of sea arrivals, similar to the same period last year when 14% of arrivals were UASC. While there was a 6% decrease in the number of sea arrivals in November compared to those of October, this was largely due to a significant decrease in crossings of Tunisians from Tunisia. In contrast, arrivals from Libya increased by approximately 84% in November compared to October. Eritreans were the largest group arriving in Italy in November, with more than 1,100 arrivals, over 700 of whom had arrived on just two boats. A group of Eritreans reported to UNHCR during disembarkation that they had been travelling for between six months and three years and experiencing various forms of violence and abuse during their journeys. As of the end of November, the primary nationalities that had arrived by sea in Italy in 2017 were Nigerians, Guineans, Ivorians, Bangladeshis, and Malians. 

Over 25,900 refugees and migrants arrived to Spain by the end of November, by land and sea, an increase of 106% compared to the same period last year. 

Although the number of sea arrivals (20,195) have tripled in 2017, they are still a manageable figure for a country like Spain and far from the numbers experienced in other countries in recent years.  
While arrivals by sea, mainly to the Andalusian coast, represent almost 80% of the total, the number of arrivals via the land borders has also increased by 13% compared to the same period last year. The majority of arrivals by sea in November continued to be Moroccans, Algerians, Ivoiriens and Guineans while the largest group entering via the land borders was Syrians (300 in November alone).

As of 30 November 2017, over 27,300 refugees and migrants had reached Greek shores in 2017, compared to over 171,700 arriving in the same period last year (an 84% reduction). Arrivals so far this year mainly originate from the Syrian Arab Republic (42%) and Iraq (19%). In November, 49% of sea arrivals were from Syria, 18% from Iraq and 11% from Afghanistan cumulatively amounting to 78%.  
More than 40% of each of these nationalities in November were children. Most arrivals in November have been to Lesvos (62%), followed by Chios (25%), Samos (9%), Kos (1%) and Rhodes (2%).  
In addition to the sea arrivals, an estimated 5,100 people have arrived this year at the Evros Greek-Turkish land border, based on provisional data as of 30 November 2017 with some 700 crossing via this route in November, including a number of Syrian families.  
These figures are similar to the 800 who arrived in October 2017 but nearly double when compared with recorded arrivals in November 2016 (370). Arrivals via the Turkey-Greece land border are not subject to the provisions of the EU-Turkey Statement.  
According to Turkish authorities, the Turkish Coast Guard (TCG) intercepted or rescued 2,052 people during November, contributing to a total of 20,452 in 2017 of persons mostly headed to Greece. The largest group intercepted or rescued at sea in 2017 continues to be Syrians. Since the beginning of the year, some 27,258 persons were intercepted by Land Forces at the Greek and Bulgarian land borders, with over 25,162 (or 92%) intercepted at the Greek land border since the beginning of 2017. Apprehensions at Bulgaria-Turkey and Greece-Turkey borders in November were a total of 3,127.

In the Balkans, over 4,400 refugees and migrants were recorded as present in Serbia as of the end of November with around 91% accomodated in government shelters with 34% comprising of children and 15% women. Amongst those recorded in the country, 52% are from Afghanistan, 14% from Iraq and 2% from Syria. Nearly 550 people registered their intention to seek asylum in Serbia in November. Since the start of the year, 13 people have been granted asylum in the country during first instance procedures. Push-backs continue to be reported from several neighbouring countries.",267,"English"

In 2017, Syria entered into its 7th year of conflict and Yemen’s health system is failing due to two years of intensified conflict, the economic crisis and a huge cholera outbreak. In Iraq, a military offensive aiming at liberating Mosul led to the displacement of almost 1 million people. Somalia is facing a triple threat of drought, impending famine, and disease outbreaks. Libya, OPT and Afghanistan struggle to provide health care services in insecure and under-resourced settings.

2393059,"UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (November 2017) **Highlights** 

- A blockade of Yemen’s ports since 6 November has been preventing the import of much needed commercial and humanitarian supplies. The humanitarian situation is further compounded by a price inflation of basic commodities, impacting the purchasing power and increasing food insecurity. 

- Further escalation of the conflict during the reporting month has resulted in a worsening situation for children with 31 cases of children (27 boys; 4 girls) killed and 56 children (41 boys; 15 girls) maimed, both verified. 

- The interruption of payment of salaries for 1.25 million public sector workers continued for another month, undermining public systems and further driving civil servants and their dependants into poverty. 

- The number of new acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/suspected cholera cases continues to decline each week, but UNICEF remains deeply concerned that children under 5 now represent 28% of all new cases, up from 18% in the summer. The total number of suspected AWD/suspected cholera cases reached 964,477 with 2,220 associated deaths, as of 30 November 2017. 

- The diphtheria outbreak continues with 239 suspected cases and 28 associated deaths reported in 55 districts across 15 governorates, with a case fatality rate of 11.7%. 62% of suspected cases were from Ibb governorate. 

- The national polio campaign launched in October was completed, with a total of 4.4 million children under 5 vaccinated, and 3.2 million children simultaneously screened for malnutrition. 292,000 acute malnutrition cases were identified and referred for treatment. 

- After two months of teachers’ strikes, 4.5 million students in 13 northern governorates have started the new school year, but they are only benefiting from discontinuous teaching. 

**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs** 

A sharp escalation of violence characterized the month of November, with airstrikes on 1 November reportedly causing the death of six children and several other civilians in a market in Sa’ada governorate. A second airstrike on 3 November reportedly killed a family of seven people, including two children and two women. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Taizz continued, reportedly killing five children.  

As of 6 November, a blockade on commercial and humanitarian shipments was in effect, impacting an already catastrophic situation. This included the movement of humanitarian workers including UNICEF staff.  

Fuel supplies were projected to last only until the end of the month, putting into jeopardy all humanitarian operations, as well as threatening the operation of public health facilities and public water systems. Vaccines requiring cold storage were also at risk, and current supplies would run out in under a month. Fuel prices were rising by as much as 100 per cent compared with previous monthly prices, and based on WFP estimates all diesel stockpiles would be depleted across Yemen by 2 December. 

The lack of fuel would also go on to affect the Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera response at a time when the number of new cases had been dropping steadily, threatening to reverse the containment of the outbreak.  

Spiking prices put increased pressures on households, further increasing the risk of widespread food insecurity and ultimately famine. 1.25 million public sector workers have still not received their salaries for over one year, and livelihoods opportunities are vanishing. While stock levels of wheat and rice were expected to last for three more months, rapid price inflation saw the average price of a standard food basket rise by 28 per cent. More than 70 per cent of families do not have any food stored, and rely on buying what they can day to day. On 20 November, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNET) warned that a continued blockade would expose many parts of Yemen to famine within three months.  

Yemen requires monthly food imports of approximately 350,000 metric tons, of which humanitarian imports make up around 75,000 metric tons. 80 per cent of commercial and humanitarian imports normally arrive through Al Hudaydah and Saleef, and in a ‘Key Messages’ document on 13 November, OCHA noted that moving supplies through Aden or Jezan ports further south would not meet the capacity demands of 27 million civilians. UNICEF has also been concerned that this would make it more difficult to respond to a worrying outbreak of diphtheria.  

After ten days of complete blockade, some sea ports in the South of the country re-opened and UNHAS flights resumed in and out of Aden. The North, however, remained blocked until an announcement on 22 November that Sana’a and Al Hudaydah would be re-opened, and on 25 November UNICEF airlifted 1.9 million lifesaving vaccines into Sana’a. The first commercial ship reached Al Hudaydah on 26 November, but after three weeks of blockade, essential commodities such as food, fuel and medical supplies had begun to run low, and by the end of the month, humanitarian organisations were still waiting for the complete lifting of the blockade.",267,"English"

**OCHA Director of Operations visited Ethiopia**

On 12-14 December 2017, Mr. John Ging, OCHA Director of Operations, visited Ethiopia to first-hand review the status of the Government-led international humanitarian response to drought and conflict-affected communities, including internally displaced people. The director met and discussed with the federal and regional Government of Ethiopia, donors, humanitarian agencies and communities affected by drought and conflict. Mr.Ging acknowledged the strong partnership the Government of Ethiopia has established over the years with the Humanitarian Country Team. He said that his visit is “a reflection of the importance of that partnership.”

The director visited Hamaressa IDP camp with over 4,000 people internally displaced by the Oromo-Somali inter-communal disputes. Following a briefing by the East Hararge zone administration about the scale of the crisis, Mr.Ging reassured authorities that he is committed to advocating for appropriate response to the crisis. The zonal authorities requested for urgent food and non-food assistance to IDPs East Hararge zone.  

Meanwhile subsequent intercommunal clashes were reported in West Hararge zone of Oromia region on the 12, 15 and 16 December resulting in more than 60 deaths. OCHA will continue to work with Government to verify access conditions and impact on humanitarian operations. Conflict has left close to 857,000 people displaced throughout the country.  

**Visit to Somali region**

During the meeting with the Somali Regional Government authorities, the region requested Mr.Ging’s advocacy support to scale up the ongoing response, particularly amidst the growing IDP needs and called for development investment in durable solutions for predictable pastoralist needs. The region also asked for the speedy implementation of cashbased assistance in all targeted woredas/districts.

2392929,"Turkey Food Security and Agriculture Sector - Quarter 3 - 2017 For almost all refugee households in Turkey, the primary source of food remains market purchase. Food insecurity among refugees therefore results, principally, from an inability to access sufficient food, or the right foods, due to their lack of purchasing power.  

This considered, FSA actors in Turkey have sought to address food insecurity among refugees through e-voucher and other restricted cash programming. In this context, in the past quarter alone, monthly dedicated food assistance was extended to up to 152,000 refugees living in both Temporary Accommodation Centres (TACs) and host communities.  

During the reporting period, partners also focused on promoting agricultural livelihoods and by the end of September over 780 refugees and vulnerable members of host communities received trainings in modern agriculture technologies. Alongside the training, in 2018-19, some of the FSA sector partners are also assessing the needs and planning for providing agriculture inputs support; farm-to-market, value chain, and agribusiness support, and environmental protection and preservation measures to create new work and entrepreneurship opportunities in areas hosting large refugee populations.

It then intensified into a severe tropical storm and affected directly in its path eastern Mindanao, western Mindanao, central Mindanao, and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); where the city of Marawi is located. The full extent of the devastation is becoming clearer as the most remote areas are becoming accessible.

- According to the Department of Social Welfare and Develoment (DSWD), A total of 313 498 persons are affeted in 998 barangays, the smallest administrative divisions in the country, mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao. A total of 20 870 families or 97 583 persons are currently staying inside 261 evacuation centres. In terms of casualties, final figures have yet to be released, medias have put the estimates at least 240 fatalities, and 100 missing. Much of the casualties resulted from flash flooding and landslides.

- Similarly, the combined effects of the storm, flash floods and land-slides have caused extensive damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and other basic social services, thus further adversely affecting the livelihood and coping strategies, and increasing the vulnerabilities of both host communities and internally displaced people (IDPs) from the conflict of Marawi city, who are still far from recovering from the conflict.

- The most imminent humanitarian needs appear to be: Shelter as many houses were destroyed. WASH, in some areas people are forced to get water from unsecured sources and water kits are either destroyed or washed away. Food, food stocks were washed away or depleted and even prior disaster malnutrition amongst communities has been recorded.

- Two DG ECHO experts are currently assessing the situation on the ground.

SO1: Contribute to the protection of newly displaced people and those affected by natural hazards. (NFIs, ESKs)  
SO2: Improve the living conditions of the protracted internally displaced persons (Transitional shelters, NFIs)  
SO3: Facilitate access to durable solutions for IDPs that are willing to locally integrate or return (Permanent shelters)  

**NEEDS ANALYSIS** 

• 1,090,000 newly displaced people are in need of Shelter/NFI assistance. The majority of the displacement is to Baidoa and Mogadishu. The displaced families are confronted with the need of shelter and other household non-food items.

• Nearly 1.4 million protracted Internally Displaced people exist countrywide • Safe and secure settlements are needed to provide crisisaffected communities with protected and healthy living spaces and environments, while ensuring sufficient privacy and dignity.  

**GAPS / CHALLENGES**

- Drought displacements are now taking a protracted trend, with many of those displaced in 2017 not planning to return to areas of origin.

- Many IDP settlements risk evictions for lack of secure tenure. Advocacy is needed to reduce secondary displacements.

- The current dyer rains and flooding are causing further damage to already weak shelters, leaving many without shelter.

- Effective delivery of assistance is hampered by limited access, insecurity, road blocks / check points and poor road network.

- Low funding for Shelter and NFIs has left no stocks prepositioned for emergency response.

• 12,012 persons have received emergency assistance Package (NFIs) in November • 55,500 persons have received emergency Shelter assistance (ESKs) in November",267,"English"
2392849,"New Agreement Signed to Support Climate Resilient Agriculture – over 500,000 Farmers to Benefit in Tamil Nadu NEW DELHI, December 26, 2017: The Government of India, the Government of Tamil Nadu and the World Bank today signed a $318 million loan agreement for the Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernization Project to promote climate resilient agriculture technologies, improve water management practices, and increase market opportunities for small and marginal farmers. About 500,000 farmers, of which a majority are small and marginal, are expected to benefit from improved and modernized tank irrigation systems.

The project will rehabilitate and modernize about 4,800 irrigation tanks and 477 check dams, spread across 66 sub-basins, in delivering bulk water to irrigation systems.

The agreement for the project was signed by Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; S K Prabhakar, Principal Secretary, Public Works Department, on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu and John Blomquist, Program Leader and Acting Country Director, World Bank, India on behalf of the World Bank.  

“This project will help Tamil Nadu scale up its efforts to unlock the full potential of its agriculture sector. It will support farmers improve the efficiency of water used in farming, diversify into high value crops, and produce crops that are resilient to the increasing threats of climate change. Such efforts will be a win-win for all, leading to better use of scarce water resources and raising household incomes of farmers,” said John Blomquist, Program Leader and Acting Country Director, World Bank, India.

Despite significant progress made during the past decade in crop diversification, its level in the state continues to remain low. Paddy is the dominant crop occupying 34 percent of total cropped areas, whereas fruits and vegetables are grown on 11 percent and pulses and oilseeds on 14 percent of total cropped areas. By helping farmers access modern technologies, linking them to markets, and providing postharvest management support, the project will enable farmers to shift from a mono crop paddy system to mixed cropping including high-value crops (fruits, vegetables, and spices), pulses, oilseeds, and millets.  

To enhance the ability of crops to withstand expected adverse impacts of climate change, the project will support smallholder producers adopt new conservation technologies such as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Sustainable Sugar Initiative (SSI). They reduce average water usage by 35 percent and increase yields by 22 percent per ha. The project is expected to increase the yield of rice, maize, and pulses by 18–20 percent. 

“The earlier World Bank-supported project on modernizing irrigated agriculture (TN IAMWARMP), had made significant impacts by modernizing irrigation infrastructure and improving the efficiency of water used for agriculture. This project will bring the policy and institutional developments achieved under the earlier project to a new level, improve farmers’ links to markets, and rehabilitate and modernize high-priority tank irrigation systems in more than 50 percent of the sub-basins of the state, which were not part of the TN IAMWARMP,” said Bayarsaikhan Tumurdavaa, Senior Agriculture Economist, and World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project.

The project will also coordinate with other World Bank-supported projects in Tamil Nadu and at the national level, including the Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project, National Hydrology Project, and National Groundwater Improvement Project to ensure synergy and enhance long-term project impact.

2392844,"2017 Year In Review **2017 was unprecedented in terms of the scale of events that affected millions of people**

***January: Record number of people in need***

At the beginning of 2017, more than 128 million people needed humanitarian assistance in 33 countries. OCHA appealed for US$22.2 billion – the largest humanitarian appeal ever launched.

The Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), then Stephen O’Brien, warned: “The scale of humanitarian crises today is greater than at any time since the United Nations was founded. Not in living memory have so many people needed our support and solidarity to survive and live in safety and dignity.”

By midyear, this had increased to some 145 million people, which means that as needs rise, so does the amount of money needed to help people. Throughout the year, humanitarian agencies reached tens of millions of people and saved millions of lives.

All that changed when the war happened and fighting started in her village. Suad and her family decided to leave all their belongings behind and flee; walking over 1,000km until they reached Idleb. They relied on aid provided by humanitarian organisations; this was barely enough to cover their family’s needs.  

Suad’s husband suffers from arthritis, nonetheless he had to find a job to cover rent and other needs. As his health worsened, they moved to a camp in northern Idleb to save on rent. Suad decided to borrow money from her neighbours and buy an old, second-hand sewing machine to bring in a little income.  

Learning about IOM’s Project from her husband, Suad applied and was soon accept- ed. “You can’t believe how happy I feel. I’ll be able to pay back the money I borrowed for the old sewing machine because it was quite a burden to us.” With the money she saved, she is able to support her family and buy medication for her sick husband. “I am getting closer to achieving my goal. I’ll work hard so I can take my kids from this tent to a decent apartment.

2392419,"Country Cash Profile Pakistan - December 2017 Pakistan is one of the country’s most vulnerable to natural and human-induced disasters worldwide.  
In the past fifteen years it has experienced large-scale earthquakes, floods, droughts and complex emergencies. Its humanitarian preparedness and response capacity has developed tremendously in that time. Pakistan already has significant experience of major humanitarian cash transfer programmes and is actively building on this foundation.  

The World Humanitarian Summit’s Grand Bargain (United Nations, 2016) stressed the need to “work together efficiently, transparently and harmoniously with new and existing partners” to move to a more “demand-driven model more responsive to the people we are assisting”. The Grand Bargain’s purpose is to “get more means in to the hands of people in need”. The Government of Pakistan, alongside many of the humanitarian and development partners and practitioners providing assistance to disaster-affected people in the country, fully support this purpose.  

The Grand Bargain’s third commitment is to increase the use and coordination of cash-based programming. The document notes that, while not a panacea suitable in all responses, cash assistance does help deliver “greater choice and empowerment to affected people”. Cash programming should use, link or align with local and national mechanisms such as social protection systems. Aid organization and donors committed to action in six areas:

1. Increase the routine use of cash alongside other aid instruments.

2. Invest in new delivery models to increase scale.

3. Build an evidence base to assess the costs, benefits, impacts and risks of cash.

4. Collaborate in cash programming to better understand risks and benefits.

5. Ensure coordination, delivery, monitoring and evaluation systems are in place.

6. Increase the use of cash programming beyond the current low levels.  

This Country Cash Profile demonstrates how Pakistan has forged ahead in the use of cash transfers to address disaster impacts in recent years, learning from experience, and how it proposes to achieve the commitments outlined above. The Profile will provide a snapshot of some of the most significant cash-based programming in Pakistan today, whether provided by government or the humanitarian and development community. It will summarize some recent initiatives on coordination and innovation for humanitarian cash transfer programming and touch on government and private sector delivery mechanisms. Finally, it will describe the Government of Pakistan’s initiative to create a national mechanism for humanitarian cash transfers that, piggy backing on existing, large-scale systems for social protection, bio-metric identity verification, grievance redress and payments, will be truly shock-responsive.",267,"English"

In this context, Council reiterates the need for partners to work closely with the Somali authorities and AMISOM to ensure enhanced coordination of support, including in the conduct of bilateral capacity-building initiatives and offensive operations;

11. Further reiterates the need for a responsive, effective, efficient and responsible field support platform as a strategic enabler to AMISOM operations. In this regard, Council requests the UN Support Office to Somalia (UNSOS) to continue to enhance its delivery of support package to AMISOM, taking into account the need to strengthen the role of the AU Special Representative and Head of AMISOM to this effect, in line with the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding between the AU and UN on the provision of support to AMISOM;

12. Takes notes of the outcomes of the Somalia Security Conference and the Somalia Partnership Forum which took place on 4 and 5 December in Mogadishu, and underscores that the continued presence of AMISOM in Somalia and the implementation of a viable transition necessitates the securing of predictable and sustainable funding for AMISOM and Somali security institutions;

13. Welcomes the steps being already taken by the Commission in addressing the current resource gaps and requests the Chairperson of the Commission to enhance its engagements with the UN Secretary General and other partners, at the required level, in securing predictable and sustainable funding for AMISOM, including through the utilisation of UN Assessed Contributions for the payment of allowances for AMISOM uniformed personnel, bearing in mind the successes made by the Mission, the transition time-frame proposed by the AU-UN Joint Review and, the reality that AMISOM represents an exemplary AU-UN strategic and operational partnership in the implementation of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter and in the spirit of the UN-AU Joint Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security, signed on 19 April 2017;

14. Urges the UNSC to consider the report of the AU-UN Joint Review and to endorse its recommendations, in order to pave the way for its speedy and effective implementation, taking into consideration the need to avoid a security vacuum in Somalia and the region, enhance coordination and ensure predictable funding for AMISOM;

Takes note of the findings of Operational Readiness Assessment (ORA) on Somali National Army (SNA) and notes with concern that the SNA, in its present state, is not yet in a position to take over or sustainably hold forward operating positions that may be handed over to it by AMISOM. In this regard, the Council reiterates that the transition to Somali led security and the drawdown of AMISOM need to be condition-based and gradual, to ensure that the hard won gains so far made against al-Shabaab are not reversed;

16. Endorses the decisions of the 25th meeting of the Military Operations Coordination Committee on 1 December 2017, which inter alia, envisages the revision of AMISOM Concept of Operations (CONOPS) in view of the changing dynamics in the security and political situation on the ground;

2392219,"Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 21 December 2017) **OVERVIEW**


The human toll of the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be critical, with 4.4 million people affected by the crisis, of whom 3.4 million require humanitarian assistance and protection in 2018. Despite many ceasefire attempts throughout 2017, civilian casualties continue to be reported, while critical civilian infrastructure regularly comes under fire. A total of 117 incidents affecting critical water and sanitation facilities were observed throughout 2017, while 56 educational facilities were damaged, destroyed or temporarily closed due to insecurity from January to November 2017. The Shelter/NFI cluster reported more than 700 houses were newly damaged from March to August 2017, while up to 130 health facilities still require rehabilitation. OHCHR recorded 552 conflict-related civilian casualties (98 killed and 454 injured) from January to November 2017, representing a three per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016. 
 
Critical humanitarian and protection needs deepen as winter sets in. During winter, the daily kilo calorie (kcal) requirement increases as the temperature drops. Meanwhile, the prices of food traditionally reach their highest levels in winter in both GCA and NGCA, whilst the cost of utilities (including for heating from November-April) peak. There is a clear trend of significantly higher unmet food needs during winter with as many as 23% of HHs in both GCA and NGCA reporting that they did not have food to meet their basic food requirements in the height of winter. With lack of income, limited access to heating energy sources, insufficient self-production and the consequent lack of food supplies, children and the elderly are at high risk of falling deeper into food insecurity Similarly, frequent shelling against water facilities and electricity lines increases risk of centralised town heating systems stopping, while the temperatures could decrease as low as -20 degrees Celsius in the coming weeks. Window of silence is urgently needed to repair the damaged section of the South Donbas Water Pipeline located right along the ‘contact line’ south of Avdiivka on which some 200,000 people are dependent and remain at substantial risk of having their heating cut off.  

Despite urgent needs during winter months, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains severely underfunded at 33 per cent ($69 million of the $204 million requirements funded). Shelter/NFI and WASH clusters are the most underfunded at around 10 per cent. Additional support is urgently needed to enable the timely delivery of critical assistance for millions in need of humanitarian aid to survive harsh winter months.",267,"English"

The Cluster reviewed and recommended 12 protection (standalone and integrated) projects for the 2018 HRP, with a budget request of $11.4M.

The GBV Sub-Cluster actively engaged in the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) with the technical review, vetting and final approval of 16 GBV stand-alone projects and 10 integrated projects (GBV-CP or GBV-CP-General Protection). The GBV SC coordination team organized a learning session for GBV SC members (group 2) on GBV supervisory structures. The session was attended by 10 participants (9F, 1M) representing 9 organizations. The new GBV SC IMO hosted by Global Communities started work on Nov 1. On 25th Nov, the 16 Days of Activism against GBV campaign took off with a series of activities in Syria, mainly in WGSS  and in Turkey. The GBV SC engaged in advocacy actions with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), on the importance of a multi-sectoral response to GBV and launching the VOICES from Syria 2018 report. The GBV SC also organized a 4Ws refresher training, attended by 29 people (17M, 12W). Finally the GBV SC organized a 10 days training for Case Managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, GBV SOPs, PSS and Case Management. The first part of this took place from 28th Nov to 2nd Dec and was attended by 17 participants (14F, 3M), representing 14 organizations.

The child protection sub-cluster hosted in Gaziantep the yearly WOS CP meet for partners on 23-24 November. In attendance were 58 participants from 43 organizations. Participants had the opportunity to reflect on the 2017 HRP implementation as well as agree on the strategy for 2018. The need to improve inter-hub engagement on issues such as family tracing, was also highlighted. Field test of the Situation Monitoring tool was conducted and data collected and analyzed. 89 KII were conducted in Rural Damascus, Idleb and Aleppo. This was done to test the tool, the questions and process.

15 Mine Action project were approved to be included in 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) after going through the vetting , strategic and technical review process.  Efforts continue to integrate risk education materials within different sectors distributions.

**Gap**

Limited specialized services or inclusive services for other groups with specific needs, e.g. persons with disabilities or older persons, remains a critical gap for the Cluster.

Limited funding for some partners affecting their capacity to scale up response in a timely manner as required.

There is a high need to increased coverage of areas in need. Many areas and IDPs still have not been reached with risk education.

**Plan**

Conduct the final centrality of protection training of 2017. Hold a 4W introductory session for new member organizations.

The 16 Days of Activism will continue until the 10th Dec with activities in Syria, especially in the WGSS and in Turkey. The second part of the 10 days training for GBV case managers working inside Syria on GBV basics, PSS, SOPs and Case Management will be conducted from 4th to 10th Dec. In Dec a CMR specialist from Amman will visit Gaziantep and will meet and train GBV and Health actors. 2 CMR trainings are also planned inside Syria during December. The GBV SC will engage in the consultation process to support the Global GBV AOR in the development of the 2018-2020 Global Strategy.

Finalize the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and key informant interview (KII) survey tool for CP situation and monitoring. Support 5 partners (3 Syrian NGOs, 1 INGO and 1 UN agency) to attend the global Case Management Supervision and Coaching Training in Amman (4 – 8 December).

2392184,"Severe malnutrition tops 11% in Bangladesh refugee camps - World Vision study 21 December 2017 (Cox's Bazar) – A recent nutrition screening of 1,862 children in Balukhali, Jamtoli and Thangkhali refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh found 199 (11 per cent) children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), according to child-focused World Vision, which conducted the seven-week assessment ending mid-December. 

“This data is alarmingly high. Although the sample size is only a fraction of all the children under five in the camps, even one child with SAM puts us one step closer to a higher mortality rate,” said Fred Witteveen, national director of World Vision Bangladesh. Severe acute malnutrition, the most visible and extreme form of undernutrition, is one of the world’s leading causes of death among children under five. 

Based on joint aid agency data from Cox’s Bazar in mid-December, of more than 35,000 children diagnosed with SAM, 18,083 have been admitted to therapeutic feeding centers for treatment, while close to 17,000 children are still in need of treatment. A recent multi-agency emergency nutrition assessment showed the prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) among all children 6-59 months of age at 24 per cent. The World Health Organization threshold for declaring a nutrition emergency is 15 per cent.

**Contributing causes** 

Poor access to clean water and improved sanitation can hurt a child’s nutritional status through diarrhoeal diseases and intestinal infections. 

According to a 3 December report in Cox’s Bazar, more than half a million people do not have adequate access to clean water and sanitation in and around the camps. Donors have funded only 23 percent of what is needed to provide 1.2 million people with sufficient water and basic sanitation. The continued arrival of refugees has further stretched already scarce facilities. Of the more than 5,300 tube wells installed, only 70 per cent work properly, while a little over one-third of the 35,650 temporary latrines are already not working. 

“Precarious access to and lack of these basic facilities in the camps can prove fatal, especially for children and others with weakened immunity,” shared Witteveen. “Most arrived in poor nutritional condition. We are racing to avoid the fatal tipping point many face.” 

To date, World Vision in partnership with UNICEF, has distributed hygiene kits and jerry cans to 14,500 people while hygiene promotion that targets at least 30,000 individuals has begun. Construction of 1,200 latrines, 600 gender sensitive bathing cubicles and 55 deep tube wells is also on-going, in close coordination with experts to ensure all facilities meet emergency response standards. World Vision has established four women and young child spaces to educate pregnant women and lactating mothers on child survival. 

Fighting that broke out almost four months ago in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State has forced out some 655,000 people to date into Bangladesh, almost all who identify as Rohingya. The population of the largest camp in Cox’s Bazar, known locally as Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, has multiplied more than five times since late August, now topping 547,000 people.

- 40,740 individuals (7,365 households) were provided with potable water in Togdheer, Sanaag and Lower Juba regions through borehole rehabilitation and water trucking.

- 9,483 individuals were reached with Gender Based Violence (GBV) response. 7,227 individuals in Mudug, 1,203 individuals in Bay, 753 individuals in Banadir and 300 individuals in Galgaduud regions through: identification of survivors, awareness raising & community engagement and legal, material, medical and psychosocial support, including provision of dignity kits and installation of solar lanterns.

**Situation overview**

From 1 to 30 November, the UNHCR-led Protection & Returns Monitoring Network (PRMN), recorded 32,000 new displacements (12,000 drought-related), bringing the total of internal displacements since the beginning of the year to 1,096,000, of which 874,000 attributable to the drought and 188,000 conflict related.

A spike in conflict driven displacements in multiple regions was observed during November - heightened military operations in Middle Shabelle (Balcad district) and ongoing conflict in Lower Shabelle were the major contributors (15,000 individuals).

While approximately 6,000 IDP returns were recorded in the month (2,000 in Mudug region and substantially all of the remainder in Bay region), these numbers appear low as the onset of the rainy season might be expected to catalyse larger IDP returns as those displaced return to home villages to plant or tend crops.",267,"English"

2392149,"Tropical storm Tembin devastates Southern Philippines, CARE responds Tropical storm Tembin, locally known as Vinta, brought catastrophic damage to several provinces in Mindanao, south of Philippines. The death toll in the storm’s onslaught rose to at least 240 particularly in communities swept by flash floods and landslides in Zamboanga Peninsula region before Christmas day.  

Tembin’s heavy downpour caused flooding, landslides and flashfloods that destroyed houses, rice fields and infrastructures. Over 500,000 people were affected in eight regions. Of which, more than 90,000 are now staying in evacuation centers.

International humanitarian organization CARE has mobilized its emergency team and local partners in Mindanao to conduct needs and damage assessments. CARE’s partner Agri-Aqua Development Coalition is assessing in the Zamboanga Peninsula, one of the hardest hit regions. Another partner Mindanao Coalition of Development NGO Networks is in Lanao provinces where communities experienced widespread flooding.

“Our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy as this disaster happened before Christmas Day, a festive time for Filipinos to be with their families. Many are now staying in evacuation centers because their houses were totally destroyed by flashfloods,” said David Gazashvili, CARE’s Country Director in the Philippines. “Our emergency team and our partner organizations are ready to provide relief assistance.”

CARE has worked in the Philippines since 1949, providing emergency relief when disaster strikes and helping communities prepare for disasters. CARE specializes in providing life-saving assistance and has more than seven decades of experience helping people recover from disasters.

2392139,"The Assad Regime Has Dropped Nearly 70,000 Barrel Bombs on Syria - The Ruthless Bombing SNHR has released a report entitled: “The Ruthless Bombing” which documents that Syrian regime forces has dropped nearly 70,000 barrel bombs since July 2012.
 
The report says that the use of barrel bombs by the Syrian regime army manifest one of the most appalling ways in which the international community has blatantly let down the Syrian people as these barrel bombs have been forgotten almost completely in the last year with no condemnations to be heard about the repeated use of this barbarian type of weapons. Additionally, the report questions the possibility of accepting a regime that drops barbarian barrels on its own country without agreeing to any form of political settlements, except for one that rehabilitees it and only leads to giving some ceremonial ministries to its opponents.
 
Fadel Abdul Ghany, chairman of SNHR, says:
“The repeated use of this arbitrary, indiscriminate weapon against residential communities is a message to the Syrian people that protecting civilians and the international law are mere illusions, and that you have to submit and accept the regime that is killing you. Security Council has to take decisive action against the Syrian regime’s use of arbitrary weapon on this large, widespread scale. The U.N. special envoy has also to play a more effectual role in putting an end to the winter of barrel bombs in Syria.”
 
The report documents the toll of barrel bomb use by Syrian regime forces from the first time it was used in July 2012 until December 2017 and the resultant casualties and attacks on vital civilian facilities. The report stresses that the use of barrel bombs haven’t stopped for even one month, including the months that saw de-escalation agreements or Geneva Talks.
 
The report draws upon the daily, ongoing, routine monitoring and documentation efforts, in addition to accounts by survivors, eyewitnesses, and local media activists as the report contains nine accounts. Also, the report relies on videos and pictures that were posted online.
 
The report sheds light on the nature of barrel bombs, manufacture methods used by the Syrian regime, types of containers and explosive materials, and whatever chemical or incendiary substances that are added in some cases. Also, the report outlines a number of areas where the Syrian regime used barrel bombs heavily in the context of military progression such as Darayya city and Khan al Sheih town in Damascus suburbs, and al Mayadeen city in Deir Ez-Zour.
 
The report records that no less than 68,334 barrel bombs have been dropped by Syrian regime helicopters or fixed-wing warplanes from its first documented use in July 2012 until December 2017. These barrel bombs have resulted in the killing of 10,763 civilians, including 1,734 children and 1,689 women (adult female). In addition, no less than 565 attacks on vital civilian facilities were recorded in which barrel bombs were used, including 76 on medical facilities, 140 on schools, 160 on mosques, and 50 on markets.
 
According to the report, the governorates that saw the largest portion of barrel bombs were Damascus and its suburbs, followed by Aleppo and then Daraa while barrel bombs were used the most in 2015 where Syrian regime forces dropped 17,318 barrel bombs in that year alone.
 
The report says that Security Council resolution 2139 represented some hope for the Syrian people due to the fact that barrel bombs were explicitly mentioned in that resolution which also promised to take further steps in the case of non-compliance. However, the rate of barrel bomb use, according to the report, never changed after the resolution was adopted. The report divides the overall toll of barrel bombs before and after the resolution as the report records no less than 20,183 barrel bombs since from July 2012 to February 22, 2014, when the resolution was adopted, while no less than 48,151 barrel bombs were documented in the period of time from the resolution was adopted until December 2017.
 
According to the report, 87 attacks with barrel bombs loaded with a poison gas and four attacks with barrel bombs loaded with incendiary ammunitions were recorded. All of these attacks took place after Security Council resolution 2139 was adopted.
 
The report stresses that the Syrian government has, beyond any doubt, violated Security Council Resolutions 2139 and 2254, and used barrel bombs in a systematic, widespread manner. Also, the Syrian government, through the crime of willful killing, has violated Article 7 of Rome Statute as well as the rules of the international human rights law, which guarantee the right to life. Seeing that these crimes were committed in a non-international armed conflict, it constitutes war crimes.
 
The report adds that barrel bomb attacks are an indiscriminate bombing that targeted defenseless civilians and caused significant damages to civilian objects. The damage was too excessive compared to the anticipated military benefit.
 
According to the report, The Syrian regime has violated the rules of the customary international law, the CWC, and all relevant Security Council resolutions -particularly 2118, 2209, and 2235- through the use of barrel bombs. Additionally, using chemical weapons constitutes a war crime according to the ICC’s Rome Statue.
 
Furthermore, the report says that Syrian regime forces have used barrel bombs loaded with incendiary ammunitions against populated residential neighborhoods without taking any measures to reduce the damages to civilians and civilian buildings and facilities.
 
The report calls on the Security Council to ensure the serious implementation of its resolutions, and calls on the four permanent state members to apply pressure on the Russian government in order to cease its support for the Syrian regime. In addition, the report stresses that an arms embargo should be imposed on the Syrian regime and all those who supply the Syrian regime with finance and weapon should be prosecuted in light of the risk of these weapons being used in crimes and serious violations of human rights.
 
Also, the report calls on the Security Council to refer the Syrian case to the International Criminal Court and provide all possible facilitations in this regard. Additionally, the report says that the Security Council should start imposing security and peace and Syria and prosecute all those whose involvement in perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity should be prosecuted. The report calls on the European Union and the United States to support the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism that was established in accordance with General Assembly Resolution 71/248, adopted on December 21, 2016, establish local tribunals that enjoy a universal jurisdiction, and address the war crimes that were perpetrated in Syria.
 
The report says that steps should be taken on the national and regional levels to form alliances to support and protect the Syrian people from the daily killing. In addition, steps should be taken to put the principle of universal jurisdiction into practice with regard to these crimes before local tribunals. Moreover, the report says that pressure should be applied on the Syrian government in order to compel it to ratify Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and comply with its restrictions.
 
The report calls for the implementation of the “Responsibility to Protect’ (R2P) norm especially after all political steps had been consumed through the agreement of the Arab League and then Kofi Annan’s plan and the Cessation of Hostilities statements and Astana Agreements that followed. Therefore, steps under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations should be taken, and the norm of the Responsibility to Protect, which was established by the United Nations General Assembly, should be implemented. The Security Council is still hindering the protection of civilians in Syria.",267,"English"
2392134,"Philippines: IFRC warns of worsening conditions following deadly Tropical Storm Tembin Manila/Kuala Lumpur 26 December —Four days after tropical storm Tembin made landfall in Mindanao, thousands of survivors are still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.

“Our teams in Mindanao are doing all they can to reach everyone who needs them. But the work is difficult and often slow,” says Philippine Red Cross Chairman Gordon. “Around the world, people are spending this time period with their families. For people affected by Tembin, what should be a peaceful time is instead full of uncertainty and fear. We need to help them.”

As responders reach the worst affected areas, details of the havoc wrought by Tembin (known locally as “Vinta”) continue to emerge. More than 500,000 people in 23 provinces have been affected. The national disaster risk reduction and management council (NDRRMC) confirms that 164 people have lost their lives to the flashfloods and landslides, with 176 are still missing. The number of casualties is expected to increase as the public authorities verify information being received from the provinces.

In addition to causing the loss of human lives and internal displacement, Tembin has substantially impacted shelter and livelihoods and caused damage to crops and critical infrastructure including roads, bridges and power transmission lines.

Volunteers and search and rescue teams from the Philippine Red Cross have been active since the hours before the storm made landfall, and are now working to reach people in need with water, food, and emergency shelter. Hot meals are being served, and welfare services provided in the evacuation centers, where over 50,000 people are staying after being evacuated prior to the landfall of the storm.

To support these efforts, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is joining the Philippine Red Cross in [appealing](https://reliefweb.int/node/2392084) for 2.8 million Swiss francs to assist more than 20,000 people affected by the storm in four of the worst affected provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro.

“People have gone through a massive shock. In just minutes, they lost everything, and then had to fight for their lives as walls of mud and water washed through their homes,” says Patrick Elliott, IFRC Operations and Programmes Manager in the Philippines.

“Now we must ensure that affected communities have immediate access to essential items and services including cash, food, water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, as well to information, psychosocial support, and protection.”

Run as part of the ‘Darfur Women Talking Peace’ campaign, the 19 December event took place at the Abu Shouk IDP camp.

In addition to discussing peace and women’s issues, participants – who came from Abu Shouk and Al Salam IDP camps -- took part in income-generation training on food processing, including how to make pasta. Each participant received a pasta machine, along with printed materials carrying peace messages that they were encouraged to share with their communities.

Ashraf Eissa, a UNAMID representative, told participants that the training aimed at empowering displaced women, particularly widows and new graduates. Mr. Essia explained that the pasta machines would help participants generate income for their families and communities. 

Nafisa Mohamed Ibrahim, Head of the Women’s Association at Abu Shouk camp, commended UNAMID’s continued efforts to support displaced women in North Darfur. Ms. Ibrahim emphasized that workshops such as the current one help strengthen relations among women at the camps while also providing an opportunity to learn new skills.

2392094,"Swaziland WHO Country Office: 2014-2015 Biennial Report **FOREWORD**

The World Health Organization (WHO) in Swaziland is pleased to share with its partners and stakeholders its 2014-2015 Biennial Report. This report covers the contribution WHO made towards addressing some of the health challenges and disease burden in the country. Over the two year the health sector made a lot of progress towards improving the health status of the people of Swaziland.  
We applaud the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland for prioritising the health sector in national budget allocation. The Government provides full funding for procurement of essential medicines like antiretroviral drugs and vaccines. We also congratulate the government for developing the second Health Sector Strategic Plan which puts Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as its central theme. The country also successfully hosted the third National Health Research Conference in 2014 and developed a national research agenda for health.  
There have been several achievements during the biennium. The year 2014 saw the government introducing the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13), a cost effective child survival intervention that contributes towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets. In 2015 the Rota Virus vaccine was added to the national routine immunisation schedule. The assent to the Tobacco Products Control Act of 2013 was followed by the development of the National Tobacco Control policy and regulations to the Act in 2014. Significant progress was made towards improving the health of mothers and children in line with attaining MDG 4 and 5. The country also completed the Stepwise approach to disease surveillance (STEPs survey) which provides essential evidence for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Swaziland also successfully conducted the mapping survey for Soil transmitted Helminthiasis and schistosomiasis with support from WHO.  
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Government of Swaziland, development partners, local non-governmental organizations and members of the communities for their support during the biennium. WHO Swaziland Country Office is committed to playing its leadership role in matters concerning health, providing technical support, building capacity of the health sector to deal with the health problems facing the country.",267,"English"
2392089,"IOM Iraq Holds Community Policing Conference on Ninewa Baghdad - In cooperation with Iraq’s Ministry of Interior, IOM Iraq held a conference on 20 December on Community Policing in Ninewa Governorate, which aims to promote cooperation between law enforcement agencies and community members towards peace and security.

Ninewa was deeply affected by the occupation by ISIL and associated conflict, with heavy damage to its infrastructure – especially in its capital Mosul – and extensive displacement, with more than 941,000 individuals still displaced across the governorate.

In 2016, with funding from the German Federal Foreign Office, IOM Iraq started the project to strengthen community policing in retaken areas of Ninewa and other conflict-affected areas in Iraq. This is done through the establishment of Community Policing Forums (CPFs) which are inclusive platforms that involve police officers, local leaders, civil society organization representatives and community members, where citizens can raise and discuss their security concerns. CPFs identify and develop initiatives that lead to safer communities, protect the most vulnerable and enhance cooperation, transparency and mutual trust between these actors. CPF members analyze the available resources in their respective communities and assess the ability of a wide range of actors to find solutions to situations that are potentially dangerous and harmful. As such, CPFs are tools for conflict prevention.

The conference followed a series of activities in November and December that included the establishment of five new CPFs in Ninewa and training for more than 400 individuals, including police officers, community members and civil society representatives, on applying community policing in a context of post-conflict returns.  

The conference was preceded by a three-day workshop exploring the role of women in security dialogue. Over 80 women and men from across Iraq participated, including police, civil society representatives and the community members, to discuss the impact of gender-based violence on community security, the role of women in violent extremism and how women and children affiliated with ISIL should be treated. Workshop participants formed working groups on these topics, and discussed how to implement action plans developed in the event.

The Community Policing conference on Ninewa was held in Baghdad and was attended by government officials, notably Mr. Saad Maan, spokesman of the Ministry of Interior and the Head of Community Police Directorate, Brigadier General Khalid Al Mhannah, NGO staff and CPF representatives from Mosul, Fallujah and Baghdad.

Brigadier General Saad Maan, spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, thanked the German Government, IOM and guests for their efforts in support of the CP model.  “We have been working very hard to put Iraqi citizens first. There will be no sustainable security in the governorates unless citizens are part of it, and that is exactly the foundation of this initiative, by strengthening community policing forums across the country, especially in Ninewa. We have achieved great results in stabilizing the country thanks to the cooperation with our international partners,” said Saad Maan.

Speakers also included CPF members from Al-Amiriat Al-Fallujah and Mosul (Baasheka), police officers, community members and civil society organization representatives, who introduced and discussed the successes and challenges of the CPFs in Ninewa. The conference gave CPF members the opportunity to network and share experiences.

“The sharing of experiences, successes and challenges of Community Policing Forums in retaken areas will help us to improve the next phase of this project and build on mutual trust that has been established”, said IOM Iraq Chief of Mission Gerard Waite.

“I am very grateful for the cooperation between the government of Iraq and Germany on this Community Policing project,” said Dr. Cyrill Nunn, German Ambassador to Iraq. “We have high hopes that the success of the project can contribute to the much-needed reconciliation and stabilization in Iraq,” added the Ambassador, highlighting the valuable contribution of CPFs for the stabilization of the Iraqi social fabric.

2392074,"The magic of results-based financing In 2018, the Zimbabwean government will fully take over the World Bank financed and Cordaid implemented health program in Zimbabwe. “We helped to revitalize the national health system”, says Arjanne Rietsema, Cordaid’s Country director in Zimbabwe. “Safely handing over the results-based financing program, will be one of our biggest achievements.”

This results-based financing (RBF) program mainly focuses on maternal and neonatal health care in 18 districts. Cordaid, acting as central purchasing agency, contracts 400 facilities (366 health centers and 34 hospitals) to provide a defined set of services. In total they serve a population of over 3 million people.

**Sustained improvement of access to health care**

“The government has allocated 10.2 million USD for the results-based financing program. This is great news. Our results will be consolidated”, says Arjanne Rietsema. The recent 2018 budget statement of the Zimbabwean government couldn’t have come at a better moment. As of January, Cordaid stops purchasing health services.

In the words of the new Zimbabwean government: “The recent turnaround in the improvement of key maternal, neonatal and child health indicators is largely on account of the implementation of innovative financing mechanisms such as results-based financing. This has led to a sustained improvement in the availability, accessibility, and utilisation of quality health care services. To sustain and consolidate these gains, the 2018 Budget proposes to allocate US$10.2 million.”

**Infusing health facilities with an entrepreneurial spirit**

“For years the Mugabe led government kept on reducing the health budget”, Rietsema explains. “It now seems that the new government is reversing the tide. They are serious in taking over the implementation of the RBF health program. This shows the success of Cordaid’s results-based financing approach. In five years’ time we managed to infuse hundreds of health facilities with an entrepreneurial spirit. This has drastically improved access to health care for the poorest, especially young mothers and children.”

*Zimbabwe health program at a glance:*

18 districts

400 health facilities (including 34 hospitals)

giving 3.2 million people access to health care

allowing 100.000 pregnant women to deliver safely

providing pregnancy check-ups to more than 125.000 women

**Restarting after total collapse**

To fully gauge the achievements of the RBF program, we need to go back to 2008. Mugabe’s economic adjustment program and his land reforms had devastated the economy. Public services, including the health system, collapsed. Salaries evaporated as a result of hyperinflation – at one point the state printed 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar notes. Food production and life expectancy dropped and people fled the country by the millions.

**Immediate results of results-based financing**

Jos Dusseljee, Cordaid’s senior health expert who kickstarted the program back in 2011: “It’s on these vestiges we started the RBF program in 2011, after having won a World Bank tender. We knew the basic health infrastructure was intact, and the human capacity was basically there. But most health facilities were derelict. Salaries were very low, leading to absenteeism. Consequently the facilities were unable to provide a full package of primary health services, let alone adhere to quality standards. Our guess was that with little push – a relatively small financial investment of 2 USD per capita, and a strictly results-based financing method – we could achieve a steep increase in the quantity and quality of health services. This proved true. We saw the magic of RBF happening before our eyes.”

Cordaid purchased entire district maternal and child health services. Initially we did this in 2 front runner districts. Soon we expanded to 16 others. Dusseljee: “We pay – or do not pay – contracted facilities according to their verified scores on a pre-agreed set of indicators. There are quantity output indicators, such as the number of deliveries, child vaccinations, ante- and postnatal care. And quality indicators, such as the quality of the premises, of management and of service delivery, besides patient satisfaction.”

**Monitoring 20 indicators in 400 facilities**

Cordaid put in place a thorough monitoring and evaluation system to check monthly achievements. This involved district health officers as well as Community Based Organisations who traced patients and measured their satisfaction with the services they received. Dusseljee: “You can imagine that monitoring 20 indicators in 400 facilities spread all over the country was quite an operation. To manage, we set up small Cordaid outposts in different provinces.”

The impact was impressive. “I have been involved in health system strengthening for many years and many different countries”, says Dusseljee. “And I can say that the first results in Zimbabwe were astonishing. Utilisation of services increased significantly. So much so that the Ministry of Health wanted us to scale up fast after they saw the results in the front runner districts.”

**Happy with the money, not with the conditions**

By this time, the Ministry of Health’s initial hesitance to collaborate with Cordaid had vanished. From the start the World Bank had insisted to work with a private implementing and purchasing agency, rather than with the government. Rietsema: “When Cordaid started, the government was happy with the money invested in Zimbabwean public health. But they weren’t happy with the conditions and the fact that not themselves, but Cordaid was the main implementer and purchasing agency.”

Once Cordaid started to roll out the program, health centers got back on track after years of gradual collapse. And government’s attitude changed overnight. “Soon government delegations came over to visit us”, Rietsema recalls. “And in their wake came delegations of other countries who wanted to learn from us.”

After 2,5 years the RBF approach implemented by Cordaid, was integrated in national health policies.

**Long awaited make-over**

On average and on a quarterly basis, Cordaid buys services worth 1000 USD per health center and 30.000 USD per hospital. Rietsema: “Theoretically our RBF payments are meant for innovation and as an incentive to perform better. They don’t cover the regular bills. State subsidies should do that. But these were lacking. That’s why RBF World Bank money – the main source of income for most facilities – was invested in the make-over they had been waiting for for years: building waiting rooms for pregnant mothers, installing solar panels, connecting facilities to the grid, giving walls a fresh coat of paint and other basic infrastructural improvements. Making the premises much more attractive and welcoming. The next step was the improvement of services, procurement of medicines, of diagnostic equipment.”

**Early booking for antenatal services**

The RBF change – or ‘the magic’ as Dusseljee calls it – is more than just the improvement of infrastructural and services. Rietsema: “Health staff had been used to things being supplied – and more often not supplied – either by donor agencies or the state. They weren’t used to the freedom and the responsibility to manage their own budget. RBF gave them just this. It pushed them to manage their own health centers and hospitals. Staff felt the need to develop strategies to attract patients. Patients who had lost their faith in public health services a long time ago. RBF pushed health staff to become more entrepreneurial. For example, some nurses have become very creative in promoting ‘early booking’ for antenatal services. Which is great as pregnant women often seek medical assistance far too late in their pregnancy. Women who book their antenatal care services early, receive soap and groceries. These are very welcome items for most households! They might cost something, but the financial benefits coming with the increase in patients far outweigh the costs.”

One thing that astonished Dusseljee – apart from the quick results – is how fast the Zimbabwean government embraced the RBF policy and nationalized it. “This and the fact that other countries took over our method as well. It confirmed our capacity to design and successfully implement innovative health financing approaches. And it strengthened our relationship with the World Bank.”

**Future of the program**

There’s one wish Rietsema still has for the next phase of the program. “I hope there will still be a technical unit that focuses on innovation and system improvement in RBF. We have started working with tablets and smartphones. But we need to do more to promote electronic invoicing and the use of tablets and applications in monitoring, to name just a few technical innovations. In addition to that: quality improvement is something we have only just started emphasising strongly. This needs to be continued.”

Dusseljee, from his side, comes with another piece of advice: “The program is built on supply-side incentives. This worked well, but statistics show that after the spectacular initial results, service use is now levelling. In order to make sure we reach everyone and come one step closer to Universal Health Coverage, there should be provisions for demand-side incentives too. For example, the government could contract and reward communities for their efforts to help the most needy in accessing health care services.”

**Handing over to the government**

Cordaid’s technical role in the RBF program will continue until mid-2018, but as of January the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Care will replace Cordaid as the purchasing agency. Rietsema: “This is why it’s so important they have allocated more than 10 million USD. The next step is that the government implements the budget and continues the program. Which would be a great relief. Cordaid is already in the process of handing over. The Ministry of Health already accommodates our technical staff.”

“At the start, we worked against the odds. Now, we can hand over a well-functioning program to a government that shows real health care commitment and is ready to further expand the RBF scheme”, Rietsema concludes. “That, to me, is very satisfying.”",267,"English"

Hours after the signing of the humanitarian cessation of hostilities in Addis Ababa on Thursday 21 December, the SPLA-IO led by Riek Machar and the government forces traded claims of attacks on their respective positions across the country.

On Monday, the SPLA spokesperson Brig Gen Lulu Ruai Koang issued a statement accusing the rebels of carrying out attacks on the government forces in five states: Yei River, Northern Liech, Amadi, Awiel East and Fashoda, in the last 24 to 72 hours.

""The rebels had stepped up offensive operations against SPLA’s positions in futile attempts to capture new strategic areas before IGAD peace monitors could embark on field visits,"" said Koang.

Also, he accused the rebels of disseminating "" negative propaganda"" in a bid to mislead the public opinion and present themselves as victims of attacks by the government forces.

Therefore, ""SPLA calls upon IGAD to immediately send investigation committee and peace monitors to investigate the latest violations as well as establish and verify who has been in control of all locations recently attacked by the rebels,"" said the army spokesperson.

2392024,"Sudan’s NLJP calls on African mediation to resume Darfur peace talks December 25, 2017 (KHARTOUM) - The National Liberation and Justice Party (NLJP) led by Tijani al-Sissi on Sunday has called on the African mediation to resume Darfur peace talks.

The former rebel Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM), formed by 19 rebel factions, signed the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) on 14 July 2011 with its leader Sissi became the chairman of the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA).

In December 2014, internal LJM differences surfaced, when Bahar Idris Abu Garda, LJM Secretary-General, publicly accused Sissi of mismanagement.

Sissi then formed the NLJP while Abu Garda established a new political party, the Liberation and Justice Party. The two parties participated in the 2015 general elections and the internal National Dialogue and they are now part of the National Consensus Government.

In statements to the semi-official Sudan Media Center (SMC) on Monday, the NLJP spokesperson Ahmed Fadl called to take advantage of all initiatives to achieve peace in Darfur, stressing their continued contacts with the rebel movements.

He said the seriousness of the rebel movements to achieve peace wouldn’t be tested until a comprehensive peace process be launched, stressing peace is a strategic choice for all Darfur movements.

The African Union High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) in coordination with the Darfur Joint Chief Mediator (JCM) mediate a two-track process in order to achieve a holistic peace in Darfur, South Korodfan and Blue Nile states and pave the way for constitutional reforms.

Talks between the government and two armed groups in Darfur, Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Sudan Liberation Movement-Minni Minnawi (SLM-MM), over a humanitarian cessation of hostilities, are deadlocked since August 2016.

Darfur holdout groups refuse the DDPD saying they want to discuss security and protection of civilians, compensations, land ownership, and justice. They point that the Doha document omitted to address these issues in the right way.

However, Khartoum says the DDPD is now part of the constitution, and it cannot be changed. They say the armed groups have to sign it and renegotiate what they want to improve it.

Darfur has been a flashpoint for lawlessness and violence since rebel movements took up arms against the Khartoum government in 2003.

UN agencies estimate that over 300,000 people were killed in Darfur conflict since 2003, and over 2.5 million were displaced.

Vice President U Henry Van Thio, chairman of the Natural Disaster Management Committee (NDMC), made the remark at the NDMC meeting 2/2017 held in the meeting hall of Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement in Nay Pyi Taw yesterday morning.

At the meeting, U Henry Van Thio said NDMC had managed matters relating to natural disaster management starting from May 2016 for nearly two years and had much experience in handling various disasters. With this experience, disaster management works are to be conducted to reduce the damages that can be caused by natural disasters.

“Natural disasters will definitely occur. Lately, the frequency of natural disasters occurring has risen, as well as its destructive power. If the level of disaster management remains the same while the power or strength of natural disaster rises, there’ll be an increase in damages and losses. Therefore, we are striving for better and more effective disaster management as the strength and power of natural disaster increases. Not only individuals, but the whole world is being threatened by national disasters and the world’s countries need to work together as well as individual country to put emphasis on the works of mitigating and reducing (the effect of) natural disasters”, said the Vice President.

At the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai, Japan from 14 to 18 March 2015, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction was set. The four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks of Sendai framework are understanding disaster risk, strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk, investing in disaster reduction for resilience and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
“Our country is following the Sendai Framework and the priorities of Sendai Framework are to be considered in the management stages of national level, state and region level, district level and township level”, remarked the Vice President.

At the national level, the Myanmar Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction (MAPDRR) is drawn according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). As the 23 work projects included in MAPDRR are the responsibility of relevant ministries, States and Regions governments there is a need for the relevant ministries, states and regions governments to take responsibility and work together.

“Annual projects need to be drawn for natural disasters, states and regions-wise. All round the year, we know the time, place and the type of disasters that could occur in our region, and we should be prepared for what to do. We also need to be prepared on response programmes and follow up programmes after the disaster happens. If things like required human, material, financial and technological resources to implement the programs are sourced and ready, arrangements to communicate and cooperate on requirements up and down as well as laterally are made, there’ll be readiness to respond to and face natural disaster in a region and further requirements will be known”, he said.

The NDMC is leading one of the natural disaster preparedness works of building cyclone shelters. A total of 85 will be built — 56 in Ayawaddy Region, 26 in Rakhine State, two in Chin State and one in Shan State. States/Regions Governments members have selected the locations. Each work committee and States/Regions Government members need to follow global agreements and policies set by the nation in conducting natural disaster management works in the region and work sector where each are responsible for and implement programs that are appropriate to their respective region. All need to suggest good ideas and discuss together on requirements for the natural disaster management work to be effective. There is a need for all to work and coordinate together with an aim to prevent and reduce the damages and losses caused by natural disasters to the people said the Vice President.

The NDMC Vice-Chairman Dr. Win Mat Aye, Union Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, said by setting up and conducting effective disaster management work programmes, the ministry is ensuring that the society becomes one that could withstand and respond to natural disasters.

When the evolution of natural disaster management is observed, it was first conducted with a view to managing works programmes after a disaster has occurred. But in later years, based on the experience gained, preparations were toward readiness to face a natural disaster, and a policy of response to natural disaster was made.

Now the preparation works focus on prevention, preparedness, and emergency response works while preparation on recovery works were also being made.

In conducting recovery or reconstruction works, it is conducted not only to make normal recovery or reconstruction works but also include programmes to prepare and withstand against future natural disasters. Furthermore, cooperation with the people in the natural disaster management has progressed from a normal process to a Community-Based Disaster Risk Management process.

Preparations against earthquakes, erosion of river banks and landslides are high capital, high-cost works. But as per the saying, “Invest today for a safer tomorrow,” prevention is better than responding and investing in natural disaster preventive/preparation works not only reduces damages and losses but the cost of reconstruction and redevelopment will also be lower, explained the Union Minister.

NDMC received nearly Ks32 billion in funding, out of which Ks14 billion was used, leaving Ks18 billion left. Funding received in US dollars was about 1 million, out of which 817,711.15 was used and 188,166.19 remains in balance according to the committee.",267,"English"

- BRAC's total coverage (based on sanitation) is 563,400 people with installation of 14,085 latrines (104 today). BRAC ensures access to safe water for 366,840 people through 1,265 shallow tube wells, 83 deep tube wells and three ring wells. 3,735 bathing cubicles were set up (53 today); especially for women and adolescent girls. A total of 3,378 latrines have been de-sludged (157 today) and made functional for reusing. 773 latrines have been decommissioned. A total of 37,116 hygiene sessions have been conducted.

**KEY CHALLENGES**

**Community’s resistance**

Sometimes local mosques show resistance towards the child friendly space activities. Thus, influential members of the community itself, such as religious leaders (imams), need to be engaged in productive discussion to increase understanding of the necessity of these activities. Active community membership and productive engagement in child protection committees can also play a significant role in opening the mindsets of the people.

**Access to market**

Rice is availed as a relief item; however, other food items (protein or vegetables) need to acquired to ensure a balanced diet. Although many FDMNs have cash, they are unable to purchase these additional items as the markets places are far from settlement and are hard to access. Another problem is that women do not have a way to earn money, as their skills may be limited to what they can produce (e.g. sew clothes and sell) and also being unable to utilise the local markets.",267,"English"

- Quality healthcare and public health campaigns have helped improve the health of residents in a district in Khost Province.

- Health services and campaigns are being delivered under the System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition Program implemented by the Ministry of Public Health.

- Specifically, the program aims to reduce maternal and child mortality through better midwifery services.

**TANAI DISTRICT, Khost Province** – A short clip about vaccinations is playing on the TV of the waiting hall. All eyes are locked on the screen. A young girl talks about the importance of vaccination in early childhood. She directly encourages people to bring their children to the nearest health center for vaccination.

Alif Khan, 60, is sitting in the tiny waiting hall of the Dargai Comprehensive Health Center (CHC) for a routine vaccination visit. Next to him is his grandson, 4, whom Alif Khan has brought for a vaccination. They are not alone in the hall, a group of more than 20 people are also there, watching the health awareness clips and making small talk.

Alif Khan lives in Potkai Lalmi village in Tanai district, Khost Province, in southeast Afghanistan. Eight years ago, people of the district were very conservative when it came to health matters. Alif Khan remembers the time when his brother died of appendicitis because they didn’t take him to a health center. “In the past, when a person had an illness in the village, people thought it was infectious and denied treating them normally,” he says. “It was hard, especially for those who had tuberculosis, because people used to believe that it did not have a cure.”

Today, residents in Tanai district are more informed about health matters. Dargai CHC holds public health awareness campaigns regularly, carried out by 24 Community Health Workers (CHW). In addition to the campaigns, doctors in the health center engage in public awareness. The TV in the waiting hall is another source of information. “We are very lucky that our doctors have a good understanding of our culture and traditions. They understand us well and deliver the services efficiently,” remarks Alif Khan as he prepares to take his grandson into the vaccination department.

Dargai CHC is one of 30 health centers in Khost Province that deliver a Basic Package of Health Services under the [System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition](http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P129663/afghanistan-system-enhancement-health-action-transition-project?lang=en) (SEHAT) Program, implemented by the [Ministry of Public Health](http://www.moph.gov.af/) (MoPH).

The clinic was established more than 20 years ago, as a small health center. Today, it has upgraded to a CHC with 21 employees, including doctors, midwives, nurses, and other support staff, serve 25,000 people in Tanai district. It receives 150 patients per day on average. “People walk long distances to reach the health center, because they trust us now” says Dr. Pacha Khan, 50, who has worked in the center for more than 20 years. “Their well-being is improving day by day.”

SEHAT aims to expand the scope, quality, and coverage of health services provided to the population, particularly for the poor. It is supported by the [International Development Association](http://www.worldbank.org/ida) (IDA), the World Bank Group’s fund for the poorest countries, and the [Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund](http://www.artf.af/) (ARTF), in partnership with multiple donors.

Health services at the CHC is provided by the Organization for Health Promotion and Management (OHPM), a nongovernmental organization (NGO), which has been contracted by MoPH. The contract is one of several performance-based partnership agreements between MoPH and NGOs to deliver defined packages of basic health services and essential hospital services under the SEHAT Program.

**Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality**

OHPM started implementing the SEHAT Program in Khost Province in July 2015 and will continue until June 2018. SEHAT covers more than 565,000 people in the province. It works to deliver all types of health services, focusing on reducing maternal and child mortality across the province.

Toward this end, the midwifery service has been strengthened in the province. According to MoPH regulation, each CHC should have two midwives, but in Khost OHPM has hired four midwives in each of the five CHCs. “We have good coordination in the SEHAT Program internally and with other organizations, especially with a French NGO, Doctors without Borders (MSF),” says Dr. Abdul Wali, SEHAT Project Manager in Khost Province. “Through this coordination, we have hired 20 more midwives in our five CHCs.”

This initiative has improved delivery of health services for mothers and children as well as raised awareness of the services. Midwife Nooriya Rahmani, who has worked in Dargai CHC for more than five years, affirms that “a few years ago, women used not to come to the health center as their knowledge about health services was very low.” But now, she says, people come seeking the services. “It shows that awareness has been raised among people in the district.”

The gynecology department of Dargai CHC receives an average of 50 patients per day and carries out three to four deliveries per 24 hours. The midwives also give health education to the women who come to the center, which has helped them to know about different illnesses. “Now there is not a single woman in our village who hasn’t come to the health center and we are really happy with the services at the Dargai Health Center,” says Almarah, 40, a resident of Tanai district. ",267,"English"

2391679,"The Southern Cameroon crisis: bridging the middle ground 22 December 2017: There is an ongoing crisis in Cameroon. Thousands have fled the English-speaking areas of the country because of violence and unrest, and many are calling for an independent state. What has the government done to alleviate this situation, and does it go far enough?

For several decades, the minority English-speaking community in Cameroon has been expressing its disillusionment with the reunification process that brought the English and the French-speaking parts of the country together in 1961.

They complain about marginalisation and under-representation in the country’s Francophone-dominated administration. Such conditions are in direct contravention to the reunification accords which pledged to preserve the status of the erstwhile autonomous English-speaking state of West Cameroon federated with French-speaking East Cameroon. This union was abruptly terminated in 1972 leading to the dissolution of the State of West Cameroon into two administrative provinces.

This issue of contention has since sparked recurrent waves of protests in Anglophone Cameroon. Fresh protests broke out in October 2016, following a strike by Anglophone teachers and lawyers demanding for educational and judiciary reforms.

Pro-Anglophone movements took advantage of the strikes to demand a return to a federal system of administration that was abolished in 1972 while others have been pushing for the [establishment of an independent state](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/171001123925310.html), separate from the majority French-speaking areas.

As it now stands, [thousands have fled](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/thousands-flee-violence-cameroons-anglophone-region-171221102642211.html) the English-speaking areas because of continued violence and unrest.

**Protests, strikes and boycotts**

Thus far, protests have largely been nonviolent in nature. These include controversial school boycotts, enforcement of general strikes (known locally as ‘ghost towns’), public protests, advocacy campaigns and the establishment of a governing council to speak on behalf of the Anglophones, which was set up by pro-Anglophone movements in the diaspora.

However, violent incidents such as the [burning down of school buildings](https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-school-set-fire-anglophone-strike-deepens/3997440.html) have also recently been witnessed. The involvement of pro-Anglophone movements in these crimes, however, has yet to be fully established beyond a set of unproven assumptions claiming that their aim was to reinforce continued school shut down.

Current protests have resulted in increased youth radicalisation, the loss of lives, the destruction of property, the imprisonment of Anglophone activists, school shut downs, poor school performance, a slowdown in economic activity, an Anglophone diaspora at odds with the government, a general sense of insecurity and a deep sense of political distrust between the Anglophone communities and the government.

The crisis contributes to the multiple conflicts risks threatening Cameroon’s fragile peace. These include the Boko Haram insurgency infiltrating the country from neighbouring Nigeria and the uncertainty that characterises the peaceful political transition from the 34-year old regime in Cameroon.

**Dialogue for peace**

This Anglophone crisis is a divisive and politically sensitive subject handled with caution by civil society organisations and Cameroon’s friends and partners.

None of them boldly identify themselves with either side but have however expressed concerns over human right abuses. They have called for dialogue towards sustainable peace. These include the United States Department of the State, The African Union Commission, the United Nations Secretariat for Central Africa, the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa, Pope Francis and the Bar Council of England and Wales.

Earlier in the crisis, Roman Catholic Bishops in Anglophone Cameroon issued a letter stating their understanding of Anglophone grievances. They have called for dialogue to facilitate their peaceful resolution. The same call came from the Fons (ethnic traditional rulers) of Cameroon’s North West Region who, like some Independent Opinion Leaders, have urged for the release of pro-Anglophones detainees to foster peace.

**Palliative measures**

n December 2016, the government responded to the crisis by engaging in talks with members of a civil society consortium that was created to speak on behalf of the Anglophone communities. These talks, however, were short-lived due to the political nature of some of the demands.

In a subsequent controversial move, the state resorted to arresting and detaining the leaders of the consortium. Others went into exile. Access to the internet was suspended in English-speaking Cameroon for three months to curb the flow of information that the government believed was fanning the crisis.

Since then, continued calls for dialogue have largely been ignored. In August 2017, the government sent delegations to discuss the state of the crisis with the diaspora. This initiative was met with stiff resistance from Anglophone activists living abroad.

Nonetheless, the government has begun introducing a series of progressive measures to address some pertinent concerns regarding the effective integration of the Anglophone communities in Cameroonian society.

These include the translation of the OHADA Uniform Act (a law harmonising business transactions in Africa) into the English language, the creation of the National Commission for Bilingualism and Multiculturalism to foster greater national integration, the creation of a Common Law Bench at the Supreme Court of Cameroon as well as a Common Law Department at the School of Administration and the English-speaking Universities of Buea and Bamenda. Some pro-Anglophone activists under detention have also been released.

These, however, have been judged as palliative measures. They do not tackle the root cause of the crisis – supposedly the quest for a federal state or secession. Some pro-Anglophone movements want a neutral third party mediating talks to resolve the crisis.

This is where the deadlock lies and until this is broken, it is uncertain the crisis will end anytime soon.",267,"English"

Water, sanitation, care and management of injuries and access to food are the most immediately and life-saving needs.

UNICEF team out of the Mindanao Field Office is working around the clock with partners on the ground to assess the extent of damage and loss.

UNICEF stands ready to deliver lifesaving water, sanitation and hygiene supplies upon request. UNICEF’s prepositioned water and sanitation supplies, that are ready to move, include water kits for families, large water bladders for community use, water purification tablets, jerry cans, and tents.

Of particular concern are the internally displaced in camps, communities already vulnerable from Marawi conflict who are once again affected. Tents were easily destroyed by the winds and rain and drove families to seek shelter elsewhere.

Lanao del Sur has been badly hit. UNICEF is present in some of the affected areas and will continue to monitor and maintain close contacts with local authorities.

In any emergency, children are among the most vulnerable. UNICEF’s first priority is to ensure children’s lives are saved and protected. To ensure that children are not in danger of contaminated water sources, lack of food, and epidemics, among others which often follow in the wake of a natural disaster.

“Our heart goes out to the children and families affected and made vulnerable by storm Vinta at this time of the year when majority of Filipinos are getting ready to celebrate Christmas.

2391659,"Red Cross uses forecast, early action to mitigate disaster impacts The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) will be using weather forecasts and early action measures to mitigate the impacts of increasing hydrometeorological hazards in the country.

This was announced during the conduct of a national dialogue on the program called “Forecast-Based Financing (FbF) and Emergency Response Preparedness for Climate Risks,” which was jointly led by the PRC together with the World Food Programme during the celebration of the Climate Change Consciousness Week.

According to PRC Chairman and CEO Richard Gordon, the concept of FbF aims to close the gap between preparedness and response.

 “With this program, we are hoping to improve early warning and early action even before a disaster strikes,” Gordon said.

The forum also became a venue for various stakeholders to come together and understand the innovative concept, and how it can contribute to building resilience to disasters especially through the improvement of the anticipatory capacities of governments and communities.

A virtual reality game on how to respond and use the FbF mechanism during disasters was also showcased during the said forum.  

For the PRC, this concept will initially be implemented until July 2020. At early stage, it will be piloted in six provinces, and as soon as knowledge and skills in developing and activating early action protocols (EAP) are established, a wider scale approach will be proposed. This means a more flexible and replicable EAP, wherein PRC can implement early action wherever impending hazards might hit the country.

**A. Situation Analysis**

**A.1 Description of the Disaster**

Hurricane Irma impacted Cuba from the morning of 8 September to the afternoon of Sunday 10 September with strong winds, rains and coastal flooding affecting 14 provinces in Cuba. The strong impact of Hurricane Irma caused severe damage to people's livelihoods, basic services, and infrastructure in rural and coastal communities in the Central and Western Regions of the country. Sectors such as housing, electric power generation, agriculture, communications, public health, education, culture, and sports suffered significant damage and recovery efforts are complex and costly. Local governments are increasing measures to ensure food and water supplies as well as to protect essential goods for affected populations.

Of the 1,863,589 people who were protected in the wake of Hurricane Irma, 11,689 continue to receive state support with food and other essential items, in Ciego de Avila, Camagüey, Villa Clara, Holguin, Sancti Spíritus, Havana, Las Tunas, Matanzas and Guantánamo.

On 12 October 2017, the Cuban government reported more than 18,000 affected people in northern Cuba had been assisted with essential relief items and has established selling points of home and construction materials at reduced prices.

To date, various governments and institutions have provided various types of support intended to help with the material losses suffered by people affected by Hurricane Irma. In turn, the Cuban Government has assumed the responsibility for most input deliveries and protecting the population.

  PRC Chairman and CEO Richard Gordon said staff and volunteers from the 31 chapters in Mindanao and its National Headquarters are currently responding and closely monitoring the situation as Tropical Storm Vinta traverses the country. 

  “When the world no longer watches, the Philippine Red Cross stays to do what must be done. We are one in helping the most vulnerable, banking on our fundamental principle of humanity,” Gordon said.

   He added that the PRC also mobilized 82 staff and 1,955 volunteers from its 24 chapters in the Visayas to help those affected by Tropical Storm Urduja, which made a total of six landfalls on December 16.

  “I would like to commend the families of our staff and volunteers who continuously share their loved ones withus so they can be of service to humanity. This is the true spirit of the holiday season,” he added.

   For Vinta alone, the PRC has so far provided hot meals to 1,880 individuals and psychosocial support to 856people. 

  PRC volunteers were also first to respond when a ceiling of the Butuan City Jail collapsed during the height of Vinta last Friday. 

  Prepositioned non-food items from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for 1,000 families are also ready for distribution at the Philippine Red Cross Chapter in Cagayan de Oro.

2391614,"‘Inexperienced’ south braces for Typhoon Tembin SOUTHERN REGION —  As Typhoon Tembin approaches the mainland, “inexperienced” localities in the south, which rarely face heavy storms, are actively preparing for worst case scenarios.

These include mass evacuations, closure of schools and businesses, and strict bans on fishing vessels venturing out to sea.

Agriculture Minister Nguyễn Xuân Cường, head of the National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention, Search and Rescue, has warned that Tembin is the most powerful ‘late season storm’ to ever enter Vietnamese waters.

The committee, in its meeting on Saturday, noted that local people and authorities of southern provinces were in general “inexperienced” in dealing with powerful storms, and the region’s infrastructure was not designed to be storm-resistant, but this time, “serious efforts must be expended to be ready for the storm.”

Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc yesterday issued a dispatch, asking localities and agencies not to be “complacent” and “avoid past mistakes.”

Experts have said that losses inflicted by the recent typhoon Damrey and the 1997 Linda typhoon would not have been so tragic had people heeded warnings and made proper preparations.

**Local preparations**

In the Mekong Delta’s Cần Thơ City, authorities have urged localities seen as vulnerable to evacuate residents to safe places.

Typhoon Tembin, the 16th tropical storm to enter the East Sea this year, is likely to force over 137,000 people in Cần Thơ to relocate. Significant damage to infrastructure and crops is also foreseen.

Typhoon Tembin, which landed in the Philippines on December 23, killing 200 people and leaving dozens of others missing, is forecast to also impact a number of other Mekong Delta localities. 

At 4pm on December 24, the storm’s centre was 120km east of Việt Nam’s Trường Sa Lớn island, the fourth largest one in the Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelago, with sustained wind speeds of 115-135km per hour.

According to the National Centre for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF), in the next 24 hours, the storm will head fast westward at 25km per hour, causing strong waves that can seriously threaten infrastructure on the Spratly Archipelago.

At 10am of December 25, the storm’s centre can be expected at about 220km east of Côn Đảo Island, off the waters of Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Province. Strongest wind speeds may reach 115-135 km per hour.

On Saturday, leaders of Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Province inspected preparatory work at local coastal localities including Vũng Tàu City and the districts of Long Điền, Đất Đỏ and Xuyên Mộc.

According to the Vũng Tàu People’s Committee, 49 ships with 362 crew on board are currently operating at sea. All of them have been updated about the storm’s developments and advised to seek shelter immediately.

The city has set up two evacuation plans for 16,500 households with 36,752 people.

Meanwhile, the southernmost province of Cà Mau has banned all fishing vessels from leaving the shore as of 16:00 on December 23. Authorities have contacted 862 fishing boats operating at sea, including 372 offshore fishing vessels, and asked them to find shelter. So far, 743 vessels have docked in safe ports.

The provincial People’s Committee also asked agencies, departments and localities to call on locals to reinforce their houses and production facilities so as to minimise losses.

As many as 250,000 students and teachers in Cà Mau Province, including tens of thousands in coastal localities, have been allowed to stay at home on December 25-26, just in case typhoon hits the province.

Similarly, HCM City’s coastal district of Cần Giờ has also shut down schools on December 25-26 and directed nearly 1100 vessels to safely anchor at ports. Preparations have been made to evacuate 5,000 people living in unsafe houses to schools, culture centres, and government buildings in the worst case scenarios.

HCM City authorities have also directed the city’s power utility to ensure continuous supply of power during and after the storm.

On December 24, the People’s Committee of Đồng Tháp Province convened an urgent meeting with 12 localities to launch plans to cope with the storm. Committee Chairman Nguyễn Văn Dương has asked the localities to update locals on storm developments, reinforce dykes and irrigation works, and promptly complete crop harvesting. 

Khương Lê Bình, director of Đồng Tháp’s weather agency, said that when the typhoon makes landfall, localities from Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu to Cà Mau will be directly affected.

The People’s Committee of Bạc Liêu Province started relocating locals from risky places on Saturday. Bạc Liêu plans to move over 85,000 households with 365,700 people in 31,000 vulnerable locations.

More than 12,000 people and 24,000 vehicles have been mobilised. The province has also applied measures to protect 33,000 hectares of rice-shrimp farms, 46,000 hectares of rice fields and 76,000 hectares of aquaculture farms.

Bạc Liêu has 1,232 fishing vessels, of which 177 are operating at sea and heading to the port.

In Tây Ninh province, locals residing around Dầu Tiếng Lake, Sài Gòn and Vàm Cỏ rivers have been asked to move to safer places and reinforce their houses.

Heavy rain and strong winds are forecast in Tây Ninh for December 25-26.

Earlier, on Friday, the central province of Bình Thuận banned fishing vessels from going to sea from 16:00. The 252 vessels with 1,875 people on board operating at sea on Friday have been informed of the storm and asked to seek safe shelters.

**Emergency meeting**

Yesterday PM Phúc also chaired an online meeting with leaders of southern localities expected to be affected by the typhoon Tembin.

PM Phúc demanded that the authorities quickly guide farmers to harvest their crops early and take ‘forceful measures’ to prevent fishing vessels from violating the sea travel ban before and during the storm.

According to the national steering committee, all localities have issued a ban on fishing activities starting December 23.

Four provinces and cities have reported their progress on evacuation and 13,564 people out of 853,604 residents in the high-risk areas in the nine southern provinces have been relocated.

However, the Prime Minister ordered that some sections of sea dykes stretching 276 km along the 774 km of the southern coast need to be watched carefully as they were recently consolidated to guard only against weaker storms with lower waves. Twenty-three ‘critical’ points have been identified from Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu to Cà Mau Province. — VNS",267,"English"

2391604,"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock – Statement on Yemen, 24 December 2017 I remain deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Yemen, where more than 22 million people need humanitarian assistance – 8.4 million of whom are already on the edge of starvation. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have continued and must stop. I am encouraged, however, by the news that the first commercial fuel imports into Hudaydah port since 6 November docked today, while commercial food imports that resumed in recent weeks have continued. 

Yemen imports approximately 90 per cent of its food and nearly all its fuel and medicine. The steady flow of these imports is a lifeline for millions of civilians. Commercial food imports are needed to keep food available and affordable in markets across the country. Fuel imports are essential to run generators in hospitals and health facilities, as well as to power water networks and sanitation systems, among other essential activities. Millions of people depend on these critical services. Hudaydah port is the closest port to the majority of Yemenis. 

As Yemen continues to grapple with widespread hunger, malnutrition, internal displacement, the world’s largest cholera outbreak, an alarming diphtheria outbreak and other challenges, it is essential that we work together to keep commercial food, medicine and fuel imports flowing into all ports. We must also ensure that life-saving humanitarian assistance is able to enter all ports swiftly and quickly reaches the millions of people who need it. Humanitarian aid is often shipped on commercial vessels, further underscoring the importance of keeping all ports open to humanitarian and commercial vessels. I am committed to working with all stakeholders to achieve this as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to seeing commercial imports of critical supplies stabilize at adequate levels. 

Commercial imports alone will not be enough to address the vast humanitarian crisis in Yemen or to provide a sustainable solution. I therefore reiterate my call for all parties to the conflict to provide unconditional, sustained humanitarian access – for both staff and supplies – across the country and without interference. I also call on all parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and engage meaningfully with the United Nations to achieve an inclusive, negotiated political settlement.

The WHO Health Emergencies Programme is currently monitoring 51 events in the region. This week’s edition covers key new and ongoing events, including:

- Declaration of the control of cholera outbreak in Borno State, Nigeria   
- Hepatitis E in Namibia   
- Humanitarian crisis in Central African Republic

**Major challenges include:**

- The humanitarian crisis in Central African Republic continues to deteriorate in the central region of the country. The seasonal migration of people and livestock to new grazing grounds is expected to trigger increased violence in the centre and northeast regions of the country and with it, even greater need for humanitarian assistance. The insecurity in the region must be urgently addressed to facilitate an effective response by WHO and partners.  

- The outbreak of cholera in South Sudan has markedly decreased as a result of concerted efforts by the national authorities and humanitarian actors. However, the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan continues to worsen, and the WASH situation remains poor, so authorities must remain vigilant to prevent a resurgence of cases.",267,"English"
2391579,"UAE steers discussion about humanitarian crisis in Horn of Africa with UN partners The United Arab Emirates Mission to the United Nations in New York, in collaboration with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has hosted a briefing to engage Members States in evaluating the humanitarian situation and possible responses in the Horn of Africa. The meeting featured briefings by the UN’s humanitarian heads in Ethiopia, Somalia, and South Sudan.

Humanitarian response and prevention is at the heart of the UAE’s foreign aid and assistance. The UAE is deeply concerned by the different situations in the Horn of Africa, from war to climate change, and is partnering with OCHA to illuminate the options for the UN community and donors to empower these countries and their people to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The humanitarian situations in the three countries continue to cripple their development progress. Drought has pushed Somalia to the brink of famine, as well as threatened lives in many parts of Ethiopia, despite strong government leadership in the 2016 and 2017 drought response. Conflict in South Sudan, worsened by climate change, has caused over 2.3 million people to flee their homes and 1 million people at risk of famine in 2018.

The meeting looked at both funding needs – which are especially acute in South Sudan – as well as innovative options to prevent and mitigate crises. These include techniques like forecast-based financing, which mandates donors to release money for humanitarian action before harsh weather strikes, and the tailoring of programs for specific demographics.

The UAE has provided over $250 million of aid to the three countries and their citizens since 2013, most recently to support Uganda as the host of hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese refugees.",267,"English"

2391564,"Pigs and cucumbers: Slavery victims with eye for business get fresh start in Ukraine Ukraine is one of Europe's trafficking hotspots, with 61,000 people trafficked since 2014
By Umberto Bacchi

KIEV, Dec 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Unemployed, in debt and struggling to provide for her son and sick mother in Ukraine, Iryna went online to hunt for a job.

She quickly found an advert that seemed perfect: building renovator wanted, in neighbouring Belarus. $1,000 a month, 8-hour working days, paid holidays and accommodation included.

""I thought it was the solution of all my problems,"" the 49-year-old, an interior designer by training, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

She was wrong.

In Belarus, Iryna - who declined to give her real name - became a victim of modern slavery, one of an estimated 25 million people trapped in forced labour globally.

Ukraine is one of Europe's trafficking hotspots, with 61,000 people trafficked since 2014 - mostly while looking for better job opportunities abroad, according to the United Nations migration agency.

Most victims are taken to Russia, Poland and other European countries where they are forced to work in factories, building sites, farms and as beggars or sex workers, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says.

BUSINESS BOOST

When Iryna arrived in Belarus in 2014 with a group of 15 Ukrainians, their passports were confiscated and they were paid $200 in the first three months - barely enough to afford food.

""We didn't even know where we were,"" she said, recalling how they were moved to various construction sites in remote areas.

Threatened at gunpoint, the group worked up to 18 hours a day renovating a two-storey house over several months. They slept on the floor, and were fed only ready-made boiled noodles.

Those who complained were beaten, said Iryna, who fell ill.

""I had problems with my stomach and a high temperature but no one would bring me medicines,"" she said.

When her captors realised she could not keep working, they returned her passport and abandoned her in the capital, Minsk.

She spent the summer doing casual jobs until she made enough money to buy a train ticket home in 2015 to Vinnytsia.

She was financially and spiritually broken, her mother having died of cancer while she was enslaved in Belarus.

""I had a terrible depression because I couldn't save my mum,"" she said, choking back tears as she recalled her return.

Yet two years on, Irnya has turned her life around.

An IOM project to help former slaves reintegrate into society, by providing them with training and money to start a business, helped her to set up a small embroidery workshop and earn enough to feed her family.

Iryna received $800 last year, which she spent on a sewing machine. She now produces towels, tablecloths and other embroidery items that she sells online and at local fairs.

""I am happy,"" she said. ""I don't have to think about getting money to buy bread.""

""EATING MY SKIN""

The trafficking business is thriving in Ukraine.

The IOM identified 639 victims in the first six months of 2017 - 30 percent up on the same period last year.

Economic crisis and political upheaval linked to the conflict in eastern Ukraine have fuelled the crime, it says.

Igor, another Ukrainain survivor, was beaten up, fed rotten food and forced to handle chemical barrels without safety equipment after being lured to Russia with the promise of a well-paid job four years ago.

Chemical leaks burned his hands, and left them itching.

""Basically it was eating my skin,"" the 37-year-old said by phone, declining to give his real name.

He was freed after about six months as his health worsened.

Igor is happy to be in Ukraine, having started a furniture company with three fellow victims he met through the IOM project, which teaches groups of up to 30 people skills to run a small company, such as management, accounting and marketing.

Since it started in 2006, almost 1,000 slavery survivors have started businesses, from pig farms and beauty salons to coffee shops and cucumber greenhouses.

Students are encouraged to submit a business plan to apply for a grant of up to $2,700 in equipment for their enterprise.

""The idea ... is to help people monetise their skills,"" said Ali Chabuk, a senior livelihood specialist at IOM Ukraine.

Owning a business also helps victims' psychological recovery, he added.

""They see themselves as something valuable, as key participants to the local economic development,"" Chabuk said.

Former slaves such as Iryna and Igor share their stories at events organised by IOM's partner charities in Ukraine - trying to raise awareness about how migration can lead to slavery.

""There's a lot of people that are trying to find themselves somewhere else, in random countries without understanding that it's possible to do something here,"" said Igor.

""My life has really settled down. It has taken on a different meaning and different colours.""",267,"English"
2391554,"Rwandan refugees encouraged to repatriate before the coming into effect of the cessation Clause Since 2011, the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees has carried out different activities encouraging the Rwandan refugees who were still living in exile to repatriate before the coming into effect of the Comprehensive Solutions Strategy (Cessation Clause) on 31st December, 2017. 

84,596 Rwandans have been repatriated since 2009.  The Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees supported those Rwandans to be well integrated in the Rwandan Society. However, there are Rwandans still living in host countries under the refugee status. 

In a press conference held on 22nd December, 2017 on the coming into effect of the cessation clause, the Hon. Minister of MIDIMAR, DE BONHEUR Jeanne d’Arc encouraged the Rwandan refugees to repatriate or get necessary documents allowing them to live legally in host countries before the coming into effect of the cessation Clause on 31st December, 2017.

“Since Rwanda is a peaceful country, we encourage the Rwandans to repatriate before the coming into effect of the cessation clause. Further, for those who are carrying out different activities in host countries, they advised to get necessary documents allowing them to legally live  in those countries,” the Minister said during the press conference with national and international media.

Apart from advising the Rwandans to repatriate or get necessary documents, the Hon. Minister reminded the Rwandans living under the refugee status that they will no longer get support from international Humanitarian organizations as usual from the time the cessation clause comes into effect.

“According to international convention, once the refugees’ status is abolished the support also ceases. For this reason, we remind the Rwandans to repatriate or get necessary documents to avoid legal stances from host countries and the lack of support from the humanitarian organizations,” she reminded.

The Cessation Clause on Rwandan refugees which comes into effect on 31st December, 2017 will have no extension as it has previously been. The coming into effect of the cessation Clause impacts the Rwandans who fled the country between 1959 and 1998. 

The cessation clause is provided by the 1951 Convention in its article 1 C spelling out the conditions under which a refugee ceases to be called a refugee. It clarifies that the cessation clause comes into effect when stateless persons whose reasons for becoming refugees have ceased to exist.",267,"English"

2391544,"Soaring together to lead stabilization – A glimpse from Abu Kershola, South Kordofan “We had no communication and interaction with the locals. We did not have friends and could not trust each other” says Yagoub Ali, an IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) member in Abu Kershola. In a similar tone, El Nour Ahmed, a farmer in Abu Kershola, expresses “As a farmer, I faced frequent clashes with nomads whose cattle come to my farm grazing and destroy my crops regularly. I resorted to violence to show my power to the nomads and to convince them that I am able to protect my farm.  I was so angry that even when I was called several times by a committee of mediators to sit and negotiate to resolve this dispute, I refused.”

But things are changing for better in Abu Kershola, following a series of training on peacebuilding and conflict management, organization of peace forums & community dialogues, productivity in integrated farms, which are ran by the local Community Management Committees (CMCs) as well as the availability of water for drinking and irrigation from water yards. UNDP’s Community Security and Stabilization Programme (C2SP) brought this change, by establishing and training the CMCs, which also managed the water yards, among others.

Sharing his experience of working with CMCs, Yagoub Ali says “The CMCs facilitated interactions between us and people of Abu Kershola, they created work for us in the integrated farms; that helped us build bridge of trust with them. We now have a source of income as well as trustful relationship with brothers and sisters of Abu Kershola.” Farmer El Nour says “After I received training through the peacebuilding workshops and engaged in community dialogues organized by the CMC, I opted for peaceful negotiation with nomads because I realized that this cycle of violence is endless and there is nothing more important than to live our lives in peace.”

Abu Kershola locality, South Kordofan has suffered years of protracted conflict. Due to its proximity to Nuba mountains, the locality has witnessed regular attacks and intensive confrontations between warring parties’ troops resulting in large scale displacement of its Nuba population from Tagali group alongside groups of Arab and Fellata origin. As a direct consequence of the continued violence, traditional reconciliatory mechanisms were no longer working properly. In addition, mounting effects of climate change in the region had exacerbated the situation leading to deeper tensions between tribes in the locality.

UNDP’s innovative response to this crisis through the C2SP project was to establish CMCs comprising representatives of different ethnic groups, occupations and age groups and build its capacity in multiple sectors to address and prevent the impact of conflict. The handing over of power to people from various tribes living in the community while establishing ownership of the process and roles were crucial to lessen tensions over scarce land and water resources amongst existing communities as well as to alleviate pressure with arrival of new inhabitants.

This CMC model approach in the C2SP project, marks UNDP’s firm commitment towards stability, conflict prevention, and peace-building in the region.  UNDP works towards increasing the resilience of communities that are affected by conflict or are at higher risk of being drawn into conflict.  Placing vulnerable communities at the core who are likely to be drawn into larger conflict in the southern states of Sudan, C2SP supports the creation of alternative livelihoods opportunities; provision of socioeconomic infrastructure; capacitates communities on peacebuilding; and opportunities of reconciliation and social cohesion, anchored in the locally-owned CMC.  

The CMC members are made up of men, women and youth from different backgrounds representing diverse segments of selected target communities who work together in all aspects of the programme component thus enhancing tolerance between different tribes in the region. Apart from Abu Kershola, C2SP has targeted 6 other communities in South Kordofan - Debaibat, Abu Jubaiyah, Abassiya, Tilo, Hay Almark and Rashad. Since 2015, out of 93 targeted communities, this project has helped realize and create stability, resilience and social cohesion in 21 communities in six different states of Sudan.

C2SP supported the vulnerable communities in Abu Kershola locality through local NGO Sibro, and funding support from the Government of United Kingdom. In November 2017, DFID and UNDP, visited Abu Kershola to assess project progress and discuss challenges and how to better support community security, conflict prevention and development in the region. This was an important mission for people in Abu Kershola as it was the first visit by members of the international community in the last seven years.

During the visit, Abu Kershola CMC members expressed that they learnt new and different ways of mediation, problem solution, and dialogue from the C2SP peacebuilding training. They also collaborated with state peacebuilding mechanism who provided consultations and technical expertise and jointly organized planning and monitoring visits. They reported that, seven cases of conflict were successfully mediated during the course of C2SP intervention.

Thanks to funding from the United Kingdom government and their knowledge, C2SP continues to support stability, conflict prevention and development in the state focusing on unemployed youth with conflict carrying capacities, at-risk women, refugees, returnees and IDPs.

C2SP efforts have provided immediate results, as shared by CMCs during the visit: The CMCs prevented reoccurence of seven cases of conflict: three different inter-tribal conflicts and four farmers – pastoralists conflicts between 2016 and mid-2017. These conflicts did not escalate because of early interventions by CMCs. Each single time, the grievances were heard and resolved, with stability ensued. Ghada Elnour, an active female member of the CMC proudly expressed “Being a member of the CMC has given me a voice. This is so important to me and other women here. In the past, we were never part of the customary mediation process, but this situation is gradually changing. Due to the training in conflict resolution which we are receiving and the membership in the CMC, I am now proudly assisting in resolving emerging differences between groups and helping to prevent increase of tensions.” Youth representative of the CMC, Abaker Adam Belo added supportively, “Before C2SP intervention, there was little interaction amongst us – the young people in Abu Kershola, we used to meet only during the market day. However, we now come together and interact weekly through peace forums, in peace day celebrations, engage in the integrated farms, and community dialogue. This has helped us work collectively to consolidate unity in the community.”

However, for longer term peace in the region, more efforts need to be made on coordinated initiatives, like the CMC members. As DFID Sudan Conflict Advisor Ben Fisher who visited Abu Kershola notes in his blog “One significant obstacle however hinders the rebuilding of peace in South Kordofan. Access to big parts of the farming areas and pasture lands is restricted by mines and unexploded devices. This seriously limits the land use, both by pastoralists and farmers. Efforts are being made to coordinate with UN Mine Action to make the area safe from unexploded explosive ordinances (UXOs).” In the meantime, Abu Kershola inhabitants rise together through the C2SP supported CMCs to ensure that stability prevails in their area.

2391539,"UN envoy to Somalia hails adoption of 2018 government budget as positive step towards financial empowerment The top United Nations official for Somalia has welcomed the country’s recent adoption of a federal budget as a major milestone in its economic development, bringing it one step closer to gaining access to funds from international financial institutions.

“This is a sign of just how far Somalia has come over the past few years – it’s getting closer to being able to stand on its feet financially, like most other members of the international community. Once key reforms and revenue collection measures are working, Somalia will be able to receive grants and concessional funding from international financial institutions, instead of relying so heavily on donors for its financial needs,” said the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Somalia, Michael Keating.

“What this means for the Somalis on the street is the real prospect of more schools, hospitals and other much-needed infrastructure as the government will be able to borrow money at fair interest rates on international markets,” he added. “It’s also a sign of growing stability, and the previous and current governments should be commended for their efforts in reaching  this point.”

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Somalia owes $5.2 billion to its international creditors. Its parliament approved a 2018 budget last week, and  the $274 million package is a significant step towards meeting the fiscal reform requirements of the IMF’s ‘Staff Monitored Program’ (SMP) for the east African country.

The SMP is designed to foster economic reconstruction efforts and enable  countries  to establish a track record of policy and reform implementation. Somalia had already completed its first SMP in 2016-2017.

“We are encouraged by the authorities’ commitment and by the pace of reforms to restore key economic and financial institutions, and welcome their efforts to keep the program on track,” the IMF said in a news release following its meeting with Somali authorities last week. “The authorities’ performance under the SMP through September 2017 was broadly satisfactory.”

A final decision on Somalia’s compliance with the requirements of the SMP for 2017 will be made by the IMF next year, and negotiations will be initiated on a follow-on SMP.

Special Representative Keating called on the country’s leaders to ensure that next year’s assessment of Somalia’s progress  is a positive one, with any political differences resolved through dialogue and a spirit of goodwill.

“Political stability can only help Somalia in this regard,” he said. “It will help attract both public and private investment, and reinforce the country’s progress towards financial empowerment.”

Somalia has been unable to service its foreign debt since civil war broke out in 1991.

Plagued by drought and armed conflict, as well as under-development, Somalia currently relies on international donors for much of its financial needs. Federal President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed ‘Farmaajo’ has repeatedly called on the country’s international creditors to grant Somalia debt relief under the so-called Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), which the IMF and World Bank established in 1996 to ensure that no poor country faces a debt burden exceeding its capacity to service and manage.",267,"English"
2391534,"Training Program Helps Nigerian Refugees in Cameroon **MINAWAO, CAMEROON** — Hundreds of Nigerian refugees who have fled the Boko Haram insurgency to the Minawao camp in northern Cameroon, now have the potential to become professional models after they were trained by the United Nations to be self-reliant and useful to themselves and their communities if they accept to voluntarily return. A majority of the carpenters and seamstresses are mothers.

Twenty-nine-year old Naomi Haman cuts wood with a hand saw to make a bench for the Minawao refugee camp school. The refugee who has been in the camp for two years, says in November 2017 she completed a six month training in carpentry.

""She came to be a carpenter so that sometimes even she goes to Nigeria, she can be able to make somethings like chairs or stools so that it can help her,"" says a Nigerian interpreter.

But Naomi's know-how is already useful and helping her to have some income. The mother of two who had depended on solely on her husband before he was killed by Boko Haram in Nigeria and continued depending on humanitarian assistance after fleeing to Cameroon, says she will receive about $ 5 when she completes and hands the bench to the refugee camp school that supplied the wood.

Just by Naomi's carpentry work shop, Theres Mami works on a sewing machine. The Cameroonian also benefits from the United Nations training program which has involved members of the host communities. Theres says she can now stitch torn dresses and be paid for her work.

She says their trainers started by drawing types of dresses on the board for them to identify and also draw and from there, they moved to various workshops where they were taught to stitch the items they were drawing.

The skills training project is part of UNHCR’s initiative to uphold the social and economic standing of refugees through education, vocational training, livelihoods promotion and self-reliance initiatives.

It encourages refugees and their hosts to interact to combat discrimination and reduce tensions and the scramble over already stretched natural resources.

Mamady Fata Kourouma, head of UNHCR in far northern Cameroon says the training will also be useful to the refugees when they voluntarily accept to return to Nigeria

He says to the UNHCR, training the refugees to be self-reliant is like giving them hope and making them independent and useful to themselves, their families and communities. He says they expect the refugees who are now professionals to continue convincing and training others who are just idling around the camp so that they can be useful and not a burden when they return to their country.

Sixty percent of the Nigerians enrolled in the training are women. They say they will need financial assistance from the U.N. and the Nigerian government to be able to set up businesses when they return.",267,"English"
2391529,"AMISOM Deputy Head of Mission pledges continued support for youths in Somalia **Mogadishu, 23 December 2017** – The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has pledged to continue supporting youths in Somalia achieve their full potential and actively participate in the development of the country.

The announcement was made by the Deputy Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (DSRCC) for Somalia, Simon Mulongo, in a meeting with a section of youth leaders held in Mogadishu today.

Mr. Mulongo said the African Union mission will offer training and work closely with partners to develop structures that will enable young people exploit their talents and prepare them for leadership.

“As AMISOM, we capacitate the youth through breaking down the negative forces and to create an enabling and stable environment for the youth to operate freely and thrive. We also support initiatives to protect the youth from extreme fundamentalism in addition to the continuous training and capacity building,” the DSRCC stated.

Mr. Mulongo was responding to requests for support made the youth leaders who also took him through the challenges young people face in Somalia.

Led by Member of Parliament Abdufatah Kasim Mohamud and Abdikaafi Mohamud Makaran, the Chairperson of the National Youth Council, the youth also discussed ways and means AMISOM could offer its support.

Mr. Makaran noted that youth leaders hope to effectively utilize various opportunities, next year, to help bring positive change in the lives of young people.

“The mindset of the youths has now changed; more youths are willing to work hard. We need to focus on awareness creation, building cohesion and unity among youth as well as creating jobs. 2018 is a year in which we want to see change for the youth, tackling unemployment and enabling development,” he stated.

His remarks were echoed by Mr. Mohamud who said youth members of parliament will establish a youth caucus to advocate for policies and legislation that support youth interests.

He appealed for training of youth MPs to help them acquire skills and knowledge needed to effectively champion the rights of young people.

“Beyond building infrastructure, we need to educate the youths and equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills. Most of the victims of Al-Shabaab are youths and we need to empower them to take the lead in the security sector, in development initiatives and in civil society endeavors,” the MP said.

The Deputy SRCC commended efforts made by the youth in the improvement of peace and security in the country. He challenged them to establish proper organizational structures to effectively utilize emerging opportunities for growth.

“As young people, you are very energetic and passionate. That energy and drive must however be harnessed and driven in the right direction for you to effectively utilize your youthfulness,” Mr.  Mulongo observed.

The DSRCC further noted that youths remain vulnerable to exploitation into acts of violent extremism, hence the need for awareness creation and empowerment.",267,"English"

2391519,"Brussels suspends deportation of Sudanese asylum seekers After reports that Sudanese were tortured upon their forced return from Belgium, deportations have been suspended, pending an investigation.

Belgium will refrain from sending refugees back to Sudan until the end of January, after reports that at least six Sudanese asylum seekers sent back to their homeland have been held and seripusly maltreated upon their return.

In September, State Secretary for Asylum and Immigration, Theo Francken, invited Sudanese officials to Brussels to help authorities identify Sudanese migrants and arrange for their forced repatriation. He wanted the delegation to review the cases of more than 100 illegal Sudanese, many of whom were arrested at the Maximiliaan Park in Brussels.

Human rights groups heavily criticised the step and warned that the officials were likely to be security agents, sent to target political refugees.

According to testimonies collected by the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, some of those returned were tortured. Two have since fled Sudan again.

“When I landed in Sudan, they stopped me for hours in the intelligence offices, they wanted to know why I went to Europe, who I met, and how I got there,"" one of the deported immigrants reported.

“I was beaten with sticks, beaten constantly, after two days they released me, I was so scared that I was bedridden for three days after that,” he said. “They [the Sudanese authorities] made me sign documents stating that I would not carry out any political action and that I would never leave the country. My life is in danger.”

In response to the reports The Belgium Chamber of Representatives held an emergency meeting late on Friday to hear testimony from Francken. “If it turns out that they were really tortured, this will be a big problem,” he told the Belgium press earlier this week. “Then no one will be sent back any more.”

The Netherlands

In November, Dutch police forcibly evicted 90 migrants, including 17 Sudanese nationals. In early December another Sudanese asylum seeker was sent back.

A Sudanese activist living in the Netherlands told Radio Dabanga at the time that the Dutch immigration authority has closed the files of 17 Sudanese nationals including Darfuris, as they doubted their arguments.

Jaber said more than 1046 families have returned from Shangil Tobaya in North Darfur to 15 villages in the Al-Wihda County, pointing the returnees became convinced that the security situation is stable following the imposition of the state authority.

He added the security organs managed to restore the situation to normal especially after the large deployment of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the area.

The commissioner pointed out that all motorcycles have been confiscated as they constitute the major means of committing crimes in the state.

Jaber further appealed to foreign and national aid groups to move urgently to meet the demands of the returnees in order to encourage them to permanently settle in their villages.

For several years, the government sought to dismantle IDPs camps that have been established in areas around the capitals of Darfur’s five states after the eruption of the armed conflict in the region.

Since the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur in July 2011, the government constructed several villages and vowed to support IDPs who return to their home areas.

However, the displaced complain that the security situation remains the same pointing to the government militia saying they continue to attack them and grab their land.

UN agencies estimate that over 300,000 people were killed in Darfur conflict since 2003, and over 2.5 million are displaced.

“I know you (SPLA) have always acted in self-defence but you now have to demonstrate the strength of an indomitable people, the sense of acting within the constitution and your duties to guard the constitution and protect lives and properties. The ceasefire agreement has been reached and the government is a signatory. You know to respect it and I want to start complying immediately.

The parties to the 2015 peace agreement converged this week in the Ethiopia capital to participate in the launch of the revitalization forum of the deal.

Kiir said the army has the right to fight back in self-defence and in pursuit of constitutional duties and functions if an attack by any of the forces identified in the ceasefire agreement.

His order comes 24 hours after a decision by the SPLM-IO leader Riek Machar who directed his troops to observe the humanitarian cessation of hostilities at midnight on Sunday 24, 2017.

The 2017 Deyr season nutrition assessment among Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the main settlements and two urban areas shows Critical prevalence of acute malnutrition (Global Acute Malnutrition-GAM ≥ 15%) in 5 out of 15 population groups surveyed in November: Qardho IDPs, Galkacyo IDPs, Garowe, Mogadishu IDPs and Baidoa IDPs - see Map 1 and Table 2.  

However, the nutrition situation among IDPs in Baidoa, Dhusmareeb Hargeisa and Berbera has shown statistically significant improvement since June 2017 (Gu season). The 2017 Deyr assessment results for IDPs in Mogadishu, Dolow and Bossaso also reflect decreases in GAM and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence since 2017 Gu although these changes are not statistically significant.  

**Assessment Overview** 

FSNAU and partners conducted joint Nutrition and Food security assessment among 15 population groups (13 IDP and two urban) across Somalia in November 2017 (Table 1). The objective of the assessments was to monitor the nutrition situation of IDPs in the 13 main IDP settlements and in selected urban areas (Mogadishu and Kismayo) as part of FSNAU’s biannual surveillance activities.  

A two-stage probability proportionate to size (PPS) cluster sampling protocol, based on SMART Methodology was used, with the exception of Qardho, Berbera and Dhusamareb IDP settlements where sampling was exhaustive. Retrospective mortality data for 136 days prior to the assessments was also collected among all sampled households. Mortality, food security and nutritional data was collected concurrently from the same households. Variables (anthropometric and all other contextual indicators) and mortality were entered using EPI info soft 3.5.4 and ENA SMART software (July 9th, 2015 version), respectively. For quality assurance, enumerators and supervisors received five days of training prior to data collection. During the field work, anthropometric dataset were checked on a daily basis using ENA SMART software plausibility parameters.  

GAM was estimated using World Health Organization growth standards, while Crude Death Rates (CDRs) and Under-Five Death Rates (U5DR) for children less than 5 years of age were calculated using the most recent population estimates available (UNDP PESS, 2014; CCCM DSA in Baidoa). The event used to calculate the recall period for the 2017 Deyr mortality assessment among IDP/urban populations was the beginning of Eidul Fitir religious holiday (i.e. 25 June 2017). Nutrition status of a total of 10 271 children (6-59 months) drawn from 7 412 households was assessed among 13 IDPs and two urban settlements covered in the 2017 Deyr assessment.",267,"English"

2391434,"Libyan activists design a peace campaign Women and men activists from Libyan civil society organizations met in Tunis from 12 to 15 December to continuing the process of preparing a campaign aimed at fostering the culture of peace, reconciliation and peaceful co-existence in Libya. The idea of the campaign came as a result of two conferences, the first held in late 2015 to develop the Libyan women peace agenda and the second held early 2017 to develop an action plan to implement the agenda. In the training, the participants learned about conflict analysis tools and why it is important to include women in the peace process for the global peace and security. They also learnt lobby and advocacy skills to present the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (UNSCR 1325)   to Libyan people over the course of the campaign.

During the workshop, organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), the seven designated focal points for Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, Obari, Sebha, Albaida and Zawia, and their team members gained a better understanding of the UNSCR 1325 and became well versed on the best ways of communicating about it.

“I am now better prepared to start the campaign in my hometown. This workshop has allowed me to develop my presentation and communication skills. It has also deepened my understanding of the objectives and means of implementing the UNSCR 1325”, said Ms. Leila Bousif from Benghazi, President of Aoun organization for Human Rights.

The participants also discussed the role of women in peaceful coexistence since the campaign, called “Peace Libya,” intends to raise women awareness of the principles of peace and community cohesion.

“Libyan women are not very active in achieving peace, but they always leaning towards it. There won’t be stability in Libya without women`s participation. Although they are paying a high price because of the war, they must play a more active and positive role to end it,” added Ms. Bousif.

“Peace Libya” campaign will be launched next year with this core message: “promotion of peaceful coexistence is the responsibility of every Libyan citizen.”

“Knowing how to transmit the messages of the campaign to local communities is a very important mater. Libya is a diverse country. At the end of the training, I felt happy because I learned new skills to communicate with people from diverse cultural background,” said Rabha Farcy.

During the training, some participants pointed out that exposing women to the UNSCR 1325 can encourage many of them to play a more active role in peace building in Libya.

“As part of the Peace Libya campaign and based on the skills I have gained in this training, I will try to explain the UNSCR 1325 to as many women as possible when I head back to Libya. Participation in the peacebuilding process is not exclusive to men. Women should also make their voices heard,” said Ms. Asia Shwihdi from Misrata.

To ensure sustainable reintegration of Somali refugee returnees, UNHCR provides the enhanced return package2 . Detailed achievements throughout November are presented below per sector.

**Protection and Return Support**

**Return Management**

■ The Government of Kenya have now authorized resumption of road convoys to Somalia but due to rainfalls in the region (Dhobley town, Lower Juba region), most of the return routes are not accessible, making return by road not feasible.

■ Flights to Kismayo have resumed on 21 November. The suspension was put in place on 28 September after the State of Jubaland imposed new landing fees on UN flights. The last return flight from Kenya to Kismayo was received on 28 September.

**Protection Monitoring**

■ UNHCR has shared the Country of Origin Information (COI) for the month of October with the Return Help Desk in Refugee Camps in Kenya and Yemen. The COI includes information about the humanitarian, security and political situation in Somalia. The COI helps Somali refugees make an informed decision about their return.

2391399,"Further support to the severe humanitarian crisis in Yemen **Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister Cannon announce further support to the severe humanitarian crisis in Yemen**

The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney T.D., and Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development, Mr. Ciarán Cannon, T.D., today announced additional Irish funding of €500,000 towards the humanitarian response in Yemen, now the world's largest crisis, with over 20 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.

This new funding is in addition to €750,000 provided last month and brings Ireland’s total direct humanitarian support to the crisis in Yemen to over €5.3 million this year, and nearly €12.5 million since 2012. In addition, Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated USD $25.6 million to Yemen in 2017. 

Ireland provides this support through the UN-managed Yemen Humanitarian Fund, an approach which allows for the most urgent needs to be met quickly, be they for food, shelter, health or protection for the most vulnerable.

 Announcing the funding, the Tánaiste said:

*“The scale and severity of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is overwhelming, and the suffering of the Yemeni people is increasing every day. A staggering 22.2 million people, or 76% of the population, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, an increase of 1.5 million people since June 2017 alone. The UN has warned that Yemen is now the world’s largest man-made humanitarian crisis, with 17.8 million people food insecure and 8.4 million people at risk of starvation.*

*Basic public services are on the brink of collapse, and the cholera outbreak is of an unprecedented scale. Over 3 million people have fled from their homes, and more than 11 million people are in need of protection, facing serious risks to their safety, well-being and basic rights.*

*Following the launch of a missile from Yemen towards Riyadh on 4 November, the Saudi-led coalition imposed restrictions on humanitarian access in Yemen. Ireland unreservedly condemns missile attacks which endanger civilian lives, including the attack on 13 December. Ireland has also consistently highlighted, in bilateral contacts and at EU level, that humanitarian and commercial access to Yemen is necessary to avoid tragedy on an appalling scale. At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I myself urged stronger EU action in this area, and I am personally committed to following this issue closely*.”

Minister of State Cannon added:

“*The humanitarian needs in Yemen continue to exceed available funding, with the UN Humanitarian Response Plan 61% funded. Ireland remains committed to responding where needs are greatest, and we have consistently provided humanitarian support to the people of Yemen. We will continue to do so in 2018*.”

- Irish Aid is the Government’s overseas assistance programme. It is managed by the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. For further information visit www.irishaid.ie.

- Ireland’s Humanitarian Assistance Policy outlines how Irish Aid saves and protects lives, alleviates suffering and maintains human dignity before, during and in the aftermath of humanitarian crises. 

- The UN OCHA Humanitarian Pooled Funds allocate funding in-country to a broad range of partners, including UN organisations, and national and international NGOs. The Pooled Funds form part of the Humanitarian Response Plan for each country and the funding is allocated to meet critical humanitarian needs ranging from food assistance to protection to livelihoods support.

- Ireland has consistently contributed to the humanitarian response in Yemen. Today’s allocation brings Ireland’s total direct humanitarian support to the crisis in Yemen to over €5.3 million this year, and nearly €12.5 million since 2012. In addition, Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated USD $ 25.6 million to Yemen this year.

- The situation for the Yemeni people will only improve permanently with peaceful resolution of the conflict. Ireland supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.

- Ireland will also continue to support efforts to investigate alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and to hold those found guilty of such violations accountable for their actions. At the UN Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen. This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.

- The situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate rapidly.

2391379,"Kandahar leaders strategize on eliminating violence against women **KANDAHAR** - To eliminate violence against women, the support and participation of everyone in Afghan society, especially religious scholars and other community leaders, is crucial, participants said at a UN-backed symposium in the capital of the southern province of Kandahar.

At the day-long event, attendees from civil society, religious leadership, academia, provincial justice offices and the department of women’s affairs discussed the state of violence against women in Kandahar and strategized on new approaches to addressing what many have characterized as an endemic problem in the southern region.

Although the Afghan government has taken steps to improve the welfare of women and eliminate gender-based violence through the Elimination of Violence Against Women legislation, the situation remains unchanged for many women, especially regions of the country where harmful traditional practices still take place.

The event, which was facilitated by the Kandahar regional office of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), ended with participants calling for more to be done by everyone, and for the government to work with community leaders to help bring change.

“Violence against women in Afghanistan must immediately stop,” said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, in recent statement. “For Afghan women to achieve their full potential and their immense capacity in development, in peace and in security, the violations of the rights of women and girls, particularly through violence, must cease.”

One in every three women around the world has experienced physical or sexual violence. Gender-based violence is a global issue, affecting millions each year, particularly the most vulnerable, including Afghan women and girls. It is now widely recognized that violence against women, including harassment and harmful practices, is major barrier to women and girls enjoying their fundamental human rights, and is a direct challenge to women’s inclusion and participation in sustaining peace.

The International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, marked every year by the United Nations on 25 November, represented the start of the global campaign on 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. This year’s 16 Days theme, ‘Leave No One Behind,’ reflected the importance of the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, which commits to eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.

UNAMA is mandated to support the Afghan Government and the people of Afghanistan as a political mission that provides 'good offices' among other key services. 'Good offices' are diplomatic steps that the UN takes publicly and in private, drawing on its independence, impartiality and integrity, to prevent international disputes from arising, escalating or spreading.

UNAMA also promotes coherent development support by the international community; assists the process of peace and reconciliation; monitors and promotes human rights and the protection of civilians in armed conflict; promotes good governance; and encourages regional cooperation.",267,"English"

The Shelter Cluster strategy will increase the health, dignity, and safety of the highly vulnerable conflict-afected women, girls, boys, and men throughout Iraq.  

Partners will target 1.88 million beneficiaries including 312,000 newly displaced or in secondary displacement; 958,000 IDPs; 49,000 returnees; 438,000 highly vulnerable people not adequately covered by social protection systems; 121,740 non-displaced in newly accessible areas. Priority will be given to those in critical shelter and NFI needs (e.g. camps, collective centres, unfinished and abandoned buildings, informal settlements, etc.).  

In order to achieve its aim, partners will work to improve the living conditions of the targeted population through tailored shelter and NFI assistance appropriate to each phase of the humanitarian response from emergency (e.g. tent/NFI provision) through protracted displacement and transitional support (e.g. camp maintenance, shelter upgrades) towards durable solutions (e.g. shelter/NFI assistance in areas of return). Particular attention will be given to the needs of people in relation to the harsh climatic conditions. The targeted population will be assisted with modalities that best meet their needs.

- While the anti-terrorist operation against ISIL in Deir-ez-zor continues, sector partners remain active in providing emergency relief assistance. In November, UNHCR with SARC collectively assisted around 52,000 people with core and supplementary non-food items. Among the locations served include Al Mayadin, Deir-ez-zor City, Enbeh, Lower Baqras, and Shmeitiyeh.

- For the first time in four years, humanitarian aid trucks were able to access both government and armed opposition group (AoG) held areas along Aleppo to Hama (M5) highway. It can be recalled that since 2013 this route was completely blocked restricting public transport and humanitarian aid delivery. With this new development, it is expected that humanitarian actors will utilized this highway to transport relief assistance particularly in the western countryside. As of this report, humanitarian aid trucks were reported to arrive in AoG-controlled areas in rural Aleppo and parts of Idleb as well as governmental areas in west Aleppo.

- The 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview was finalized and published in November. Around 4.7 million people are still in need of NFI assistance of which 3.3 million are in an acute situation. The need remains substantial especially for those newly-displaced population requiring core, supplementary, and seasonal assistance.",267,"English"

2391354,"UNHCR welcomes Britain’s support for South Sudanese refugees in Sudan [EN/AR] **Khartoum, Sudan, 21 December 2017** - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today welcomed a multi-year contribution of £7.5 million (approximately US$9.9 million) spread over three years from the Government of the United Kingdom to respond to the critical needs of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan, and those anticipated to arrive between 2018 and 2020.

UNHCR will use the funds to provide life-saving assistance to respond to the vital needs of the South Sudanese refugees as well as host communities in White Nile; West and South Kordofan; and East and South Darfur in the area of protection, water and sanitation, and education. The funds will also allow UNHCR to procure non-food items, such as blankets, sleeping mats and cooking kits, for this vulnerable population. South Sudanese refugees arrive in Sudan in very poor condition, exhausted after long walks to reach the borders and in urgent need of protection, especially children who have lost or been separated from their families during the journey.

Dr. Christopher Pycroft, Head of the Department for International Development in Sudan, said “The unfolding tragedy in South Sudan has had terrible human consequences. The British people stand by those affected by conflict and famine, and commit to continue to support the hundreds of thousands of women and children who have been forced to flee their own country, by providing them with safety, food and water and a roof over their heads. DFID has committed to provide this assistance over three years to help our partner UNHCR, and the other aid agencies involved, to plan ahead and deliver life-saving assistance on the ground more effectively, and to help ensure that children continue to have access to Education even during this time of crisis.”

The UK has been a major donor to UNHCR in Sudan for years, contributing over £ 14.8 million (around US$ 20.8 million) in the past four years. This has enabled UNHCR to assist refugees in the country and has greatly contributed to supporting the South Sudan response since the early days of the crisis.  
Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR’s Representative in Sudan particularly welcomed this multi-year agreement and said: “The United Kingdom has consistently demonstrated its commitment to UNHCR activities to assist the most vulnerable children and people from South Sudan. In an operational context that can change very quickly, this multi-year funding will give more predictability and flexibility to UNHCR to respond more efficiently and at scale when a crisis hits and help respond to expected needs in 2018 as part of our contingency planning”.

To date, close to 453,000 South Sudanese have crossed into Sudan since December 2013, and are now residing across 9 states, in addition with an estimated 350,000 remaining in Sudan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.

Sudan continues to open its borders to refugees seeking safety in the country, which is critical as the conflict in South Sudan is becoming ever more complex in parallel with a worsening food security situation.

2391339,"Burundi: Acute Food Insecurity Situation October - December 2017 and January - May 2018 Based on the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) scale, 9 of the 18 provinces in Burundi are classified as in Phase 2 while the other provinces are categorised as being in Phase 1. According to the IPC AMN scale, Phase 2 indicates ‘Alert’ situation, which requires strengthening of existing response capacity and resilience and addressing of contributing factors to malnutrition as well as monitoring of the situation.

Of the nine provinces classified as being in “Alert” situation with regards to acute malnutrition, 3 provinces (namely Karusi, Kayanza, and Kirundo) have relatively high levels of acute malnutrition levels which require particular attention. It's worth to recall that at least 3 cases of Noma have been registered this year in Kirundo province.

Approximately about 125,000 children are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 9 of the 18 provinces alone in the country. Available data on the coverage of acute malnutrition treatment suggests that the coverage is not optimal.

Major contributing factors to acute malnutrition identified during the analysis are (1) very poor quality of food intake by children, (2) relatively high prevalence of diseases (particularly malaria), and (3) poor sanitation – see annex II for details on major contributing factors to acute malnutrition by province. It is noted that the quality of food intake by children is poor even in provinces where acute food insecurity is low. This suggests that it may be related to behaviour and/or lack of awareness of child feeding among caregivers. Poor quality of food in other provinces may likely be the result of both food insecurity as well as behaviour and lack of awareness. Several structural issues especially human, physical, and financial capital were also identified as major factors contributing to acute malnutrition in these areas. Anaemia is a major public health problem that calls for urgent attention in all provinces.

According to the IPC AMN projection analysis, the situation is likely to remain the same in all 9 provinces that are classified as Phase 2 during the upcoming rainy season (February-May 2018). However, slight deterioration in acute malnutrition levels are likely in some provinces because of seasonality and disease trends.

Over the past month the situation for the Yemeni people continued to deteriorate and in addition to the suffering caused by the continued conflict the tightened blockade has made a bad situation significantly worse. It is beyond comprehension how people continue to survive the hardships brought about by over 2 years of intense war.

However based on the figures from October implementation beneficiaries receiving emergency shelter kits were almost double what was achieved in October similarly for families receiving NFI kits. The distribution of rental subsidy was almost 20% more than last month.  

In total some 100,000 people were assisted in November 20% more than in October.

Strong coordination on winter plan and response is required to make sure the most vulnerable people in need, in camps and out of camps settings are reached with appropriate support.  
As per the IOM-led DTM report, 3.2 million IDPs and 2.6 million Returnees have been identified across the country, from January 2014 to 31 st October 2017. 

▪ The number of IDPs has increased in Camps (from 18% of 3.0 million beginning of Jan.’17 to 24% of 3.2 million end of Oct.’17); 

▪ 49% of the 3.2 million IDPs are currently in private settings (in rentals and in host families) while 12% remain in critical shelter arrangements (unfinished/abandoned building; school/religious buildings and informal settlements) and 15% in other unspecified shelter types. 

▪ The number of returnees has increased (from 1.4 million beginning of Jan.’17 to 2.6 million end of Oct.’17); 

▪ 95% of the returnees are in their habitual residence while 5% remains in critical shelter arrangement and in private settings. 

However MCNA (round-4&5) conducted in April and August revealed that 24% of the returnees remain in very crucial Shelter/NFI need.

**CURRENT CLUSTER INTERVENTIONS (1st Jan. – 31st Oct. 2017)**

▪ Out of the overall target of 2.3 million, 1,700,568 people have been assisted with non-food items kits; 1,120,674 of which have also benefited from shelter interventions. The coverage for non-food items kits stands at 73% of the cluster target; and the coverage for shelter stands at 48% of cluster target. From the total reached beneficiaries, 1,680,378 of vulnerable people were provided with safe and appropriate critical life-saving non-food items, 779,040 of which benefited from appropriate emergency shelter interventions in first line response. In second line response, 332,412 people were assisted with shelter upgrade and basic repair interventions including 20,190 people with critical life-saving non-food items replenishment and 9,222 people were assisted in full cluster response which consist of expand safe, dignified shelter and housing options in accordance with the cluster agreed standards. 

▪ Cluster partners have completed their post distributions monitoring surveys been conducted (by phone or in field visit) in camps and out of camps settings, reaching out 7,341 vulnerable households.

- On 6 December, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres said following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that, “Jerusalem  is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides”. To read the full statement, please click here.

- For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which has further undermined an already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 2017 in the context of disputes between the de-facto authorities in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely impacted the availability of essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and has undermined Gaza’s fragile economy, especially the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. In the already impoverished Gaza Strip, residents have learned to adapt to the fact that electricity is only available for between two and four hours a day. The shortages have defined how people live their lives: getting up in the middle of the night if there is power to run washing machines or turn on water pumps. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory, electricity blackouts in Gaza last between 19-21 hours each day. Families in Gaza are forced to spend a large part of their income on energy, whether on the meagre supply of electricity they receive through high voltage lines, or on the cost of fuel, generators and their repair.

- A ceremony to mark the International Day of Human Rights was organized by the UNRWA Field Education Programme at Beach Preparatory Girls School A in Beach camp, western Gaza city, on 11 December. The Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, and other senior UNRWA staff as well as teachers, students and their parents attended the event. The event included activities such as songs, sketches and a drawing competition for the students. The parents also participated in an activity where they shared their views on gender equality and non-discrimination in the Gaza Strip, wishing for a better future for all. For over ten years UNRWA has been integrating human rights, conflict resolution and tolerance in its school activities. In May 2012, the Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA. This policy builds upon past successes, but also draws from international best practices and paves the way to better integrate human rights education in all our schools.

- An online lecture with the Japanese Research Syowa Station in Antarctica was conducted via Skype to a group of 30 students from two UNRWA schools on 11 December 2017. Dr. Hirofumi Oe, the station’s medical doctor, introduced the life in Antarctica and the mission of the research station to the students. The lecture lasted for two hours and included a presentation with photos and videos followed by an open discussion during which the students raised a number of questions such as the impact of climate change on the world, and Antarctica in particular. Commenting on the lecture, Dr. Hirofumi expressed his pleasure in speaking with UNRWA students in Gaza, explaining the environment of Antarctica, and the purpose and activities of the Japanese research mission there. The lecture was a great opportunity to widen both the knowledge and horizon of students in Gaza. Freedom of movement outside Gaza is virtually non-existent due to the blockade; 90 per cent of the over 271,900 students from UNRWA schools have never left the Gaza Strip in their lives. The UNRWA Education Programme recognizes the critical need for students to understand and connect with the world, and hence always seeks to implement innovative projects through which refugee students can link to, and share knowledge and ideas with, their peers and others in the rest of the world.

- UNRWA in Gaza celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 4 December 2017. The ceremony took place at the UNRWA Gaza Field Office compound and was attended by UNRWA Director of Operations, Mr. Matthias Schmale, Chief of the Field Relief and Social Services Programme, Mr. Asem Abu Shawish, UNRWA senior staff as well as heads of community rehabilitation centres that provide support to persons with disabilities across the Gaza Strip. The ceremony included speeches by Mr. Schmale, representatives from the coordination committee of the community rehabilitation centres, and a representative of persons with disabilities. It also included many uplifting performances by children with disabilities. The disability sub-programme of the UNRWA Relief and Social Services Programme provides various forms of support to people with disabilities and assists vulnerable groups of Palestine refugees through community social interventions. It conducts activities through 19 Community-Based Organizations, 7 Women’s Programme Centres, 7 Community-Based Rehabilitation Centres for persons with disabilities and 5 Youth Activity Centres.

- During the reporting period, as part of his regular outreach visits, the Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, Mr. Matthias Schmale, visited Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, and Gaza City. During the visit to Khan Younis camp, the Director met with a beneficiary family receiving Social Safety Net support due to their extreme poverty and visited UNRWA Abu Teama Preparatory Co-ed school. In his visit to Gaza city, Mr. Schmale met with members of the School Parliament and their teachers at the UNRWA Gaza Preparatory Girls A, and then proceeded to Tuffah Distribution Centre, a Community-Based Rehabilitation Centre and the Sheikh Radwan Health Centre. The visit was followed by a meeting with UNRWA Health Programme senior staff in which the Chief of the Field Health Programme, Dr. Ghada Al-Jadba, highlighted the programme’s achievements and challenges in 2017.

**UNRWA’S RESPONSE**

**THE UNRWA JOB CREATION PROGRAMME: PROVIDING A SOURCE OF INCOME AND STRENGTHENING SELF-RELIANCE**

The blockade of Gaza entered its 11th year in June 2017. The heavy restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza , in addition to the three consecutive conflicts and the internal political divide, have not only crushed the enclave’s formerly trade-based economy, they are also heavily responsible for the sky-rocketing unemployment rates. Extreme poverty, food insecurity and confinement contribute to depression, and hopelessness. According to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in Gaza was at 46.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.Even more dramatically, 71 per cent of females in Gaza are reportedly unemployed.
Through the UNRWA Job Creation Programme (JCP), the Agency works to mitigate the impact of the collapsed economy and labour market in Gaza by providing livelihood opportunities for Palestine refugees.

41-year-old Palestine refugee Enshirah Al-Batah, who lives with her nine-member family in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza Strip, received a three-month work opportunity as a labourer in an agriculture project in Beit Lahia as part of UNRWA’s JCP activities.

“I applied for a position in the UNRWA Job Creation Programme seven years ago. I felt blessed and happy when UNRWA called to inform me that I got a three-month job opportunity. Every morning I go to work with my colleagues and start my work with hope and passion. We pick and package strawberries and prepare them for possible export,” Enshirah said.

The programme targets both skilled and unskilled workers as well as professionals. Priority is given to applicants from households who have been assessed as living below the poverty line of less than US$ 3.87 per person per day; other criteria are gender, age, skills, or location. UNRWA aims to provide 40 per cent of skilled opportunities to women and 40 per cent of all job opportunities to youth. UNRWA also offers thousands of opportunities for graduates from Gaza universities through its Graduate Training Programme.

“This is my first paid job ever. Due to my family’s difficult economic conditions, I received little education. I can hardly read and write so it’s not easy to find a job. At the beginning, it was hard to adapt with the new routine, but now I can’t wait until morning comes to see my friends. I feel more confident and productive,” Enshirah added.

The Job Creation Programme provides not only a source of income, but also helps to restore self-respect, dignity and some form of self-reliance to thousands of Palestine refugees. The money earned through short-term job opportunities is mostly spent to cover basic needs such as medicine, fresh food, or clothes.

“I use the money I gain to repay my family debts and pay for my daughter’s college tuition. My dreams and hopes are simple. I dream of having a stable source of income,” Enshirah added.

In the first nine months of 2017, UNRWA created job opportunities for 16,515 beneficiaries, injecting US$ 12.4 million into the Gaza economy. To address high levels of youth unemployment in Gaza, a sub-component of the JCP – the Graduate Training Programme – offered 2,799 (out of the total of 16,515 jobs) opportunities to recent graduates in 2017 to date.

**FUNDING NEEDS**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget in 2017. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

Following the 2014 conflict, US$ 316 million has been pledged in support of UNRWA’s emergency shelter programme, for which an estimated US$ 720 million is required. This leaves a current shortfall of US$ 404 million. UNRWA urgently appeals to donors to generously contribute to its emergency shelter programme to provide displaced Palestine refugees in Gaza with rental subsidies or cash assistance to undertake reconstruction of their demolished homes.

As presented in UNRWA’s occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) Emergency Appeal for 2017, the Agency is seeking US$ 402 million to meet the minimum humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees in the oPt. The Gaza portion of the Emergency Appeal amounts to US$ 355 million for 2017, to address protracted, large scale humanitarian needs. More information can be found [here](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/emergency-appeals/opt-emergency-appeal-2017).

**CROSSINGS**

Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have undermined the living conditions of 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, Erez crossing and Kerem Shalom crossing. Rafah crossing is controlled by the Egyptian authorities and technically allows for the movement of a number of authorized travelers, Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases only. Erez crossing is controlled by Israeli authorities and technically allows for the movement of aid workers and limited numbers of authorized travelers, including Palestinian medical and humanitarian cases. Kerem Shalom crossing, also controlled by Israeli authorities, technically allows for the movement of authorized goods only.",267,"English"
2391279,"New Zealand commits 1 million NZD to help UNFPA meet the humanitarian needs of women and girls amid the Rohingya crisis Cox’s Bazar 23 December 2017 - The New Zealand government has committed 1 million NZD to help UNFPA address the sexual and reproductive health and protection needs of women and girls, and to aid survivors of gender-based violence amid the Rohingya humanitarian response.

Since the 25th of August, 655,000 Rohingya refugees have entered Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh from neighbouring Rakhine State in Myanmar. Now four months into the crisis, the needs on the ground – for shelter, food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare and protection – remain staggering. And the unique health and safety needs of women and girls – who represent over half of arrivals – compounded and far from being met.

More than 30,000 women among the new arrivals are pregnant, and almost 11,000 are expected to give birth by the end of February 2018. Nearly 1,500 are at risk of life-threatening pregnancy complications and need access to functioning health facilities for delivery.

Overcrowding and limited privacy across the camps and settlement areas have heightened risks of gender-based violence and exploitation for women and girls. Up to one in five Rohingya refugee families are female-headed, exhibiting even greater vulnerability.

The New Zealand government’s funding commitment recognizes that women and girls are particularly impacted by the crisis. “We commend UNFPA’s tireless efforts to support women and girls impacted by the Rohingya refugee crisis,” said Craig John Hawke, Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations. “We recognize the important role UNFPA plays in delivering lifesaving sexual and reproductive health care and safeguarding the rights of women and girls and we are pleased to support these efforts.”

UNFPA is working in partnership with the Bangladesh Government, UN agencies, and international and local organizations to meet the health and protection needs of the most vulnerable women and girls in Cox’s Bazar, including Rohingya refugees and host communities. Iori Kato, Acting Representative of UNFPA Bangladesh lauds New Zealand’s timely support to scale up the response. “Currently, there is no end in sight to this crisis. With more women and girls arriving from Myanmar by the day, this funding is crucial for the scale up of our lifesaving reproductive health and gender-based violence prevention and response services. We are grateful for the Government of New Zealand’s show of leadership, helping to ensure women and girls are not left behind in this response.”

**As African try to adapt to changing conditions, climate information specific to the continent is key, scientists say**

CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Dec 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - One big problem confronts Africa as it tries to predict how its weather patterns will shift in the face of climate change: Almost all the climate models for the continent were created in the United States or Europe.

Now South African climate researcher Francois Engelbrecht has changed that by developing a climate model for Africa, in Africa.

The model aims to ""generate reliable projections of future climate change over Africa,"" said Engelbrecht, the chief researcher for climate studies, modeling and environmental health at South Africa's [Council for Scientific and Industrial Research](https://www.csir.co.za/).

Those projections include figuring out which areas will get more or less rainfall – a key to adapting agriculture successfully – or looking at where African grasslands might give way to thickets as more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere drives the growth of trees.

""We know that climate is changing, risks are changing, including changes in the risk of heatwaves, flooding, drought, tropical cyclones, changes in growing seasons (and) rising temperatures,"" said Rachel James, a visiting climate researcher at the University of Cape Town.

""People everywhere will need to adapt to these changing conditions in the years and decades to come,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""The problem is that we don't know exactly what will happen in any one location. It's challenging to predict which areas might get more rainfall and which might get less.""

MORE DETAIL

The new African-built climate model aims to generate much more detailed and place-specific projections, to give decision makers the information they need to prepare for coming changes.

It responds, in part, to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noting in 2014 that Africa was the only region of the world in which climate forecasts had not improved in recent years.

Developed in collaboration with Australia, the model will look at things such as how El Nino patterns are likely to affect Africa in the future and how African monsoons may shift, Engelbrecht said.

Africa has a lot of expertise on its ecosystems, regional oceans, and climate, but this knowledge has not been built into models up to now, he said.

Models developed by northern hemisphere countries have tended to focus more on areas of northern interest, such as the Arctic, where sea ice is fast disappearing, he said.

And global models that include Africa generally are not specific enough to be helpful on the ground in a particular country or region, said Neville Sweijd, head of the South Africa-based [Alliance for Collaboration on Climate and Earth Systems Science](https://www.access.ac.za/).

""All models are not complete representations of reality and have to be tested for sensitivity to various features and phenomena,"" he said, including the direction of winds.

James noted that ""climates in Africa are particularly challenging to model"" because of the influence of local events such as key thunderstorms, ""which occur on finer scales than the models can resolve,"" she said.

A ‘GAME CHANGER'

Jean-Pierre Roux, who manages the [Future Climate for Africa](http://www.futureclimateafrica.org/) project, an effort, backed by UK aid, to improve climate information and resilience on the continent, said he worries that weak climate information and weather information services that do not meet the needs of vulnerable communities could hurt millions in Africa.

Having African scientists involved in climate information efforts is important as African researchers naturally have more expertise on local and regional weather and climate in many cases, he said.

Also, ""it gives a better chance for African priorities to shape the research agenda and leaves behind a legacy in terms of improved African capacity to conduct research,"" he said.

African climate scientists say they are also worried that the continent does not yet have enough climate scientists to collaborate with other experts globally on models and other work.

""A lot of model application work is being done in Africa, but not by Africans or at African institutions. That disempowers African intellectual development in this field,"" Sweijd told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Engelbrecht sees the development of his model as a chance to build skills in everything from climate science to high-performance computing.

""It is a game changer in enhancing our human capacity in the climate and earth sciences,"" he said.

2391269,"Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee Awarded $100 Million for Early Childhood Education of Syrian Refugees Three Finalists Awarded $15 Million Each in Global Competition for Bold Solutions to Critical Problems of Our Time

Chicago, Illinois, December 20, 2017 — The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation today awarded a $100 million grant to [Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee (IRC)](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/2017/) to educate young children displaced by conflict and persecution in the Middle East. 

The Foundation’s Board, deliberating among four finalists in *[100&Change](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/)*, MacArthur’s global competition for bold solutions to critical problems of our time, decided to award additional grants of $15 million to each of the other three finalists, based on the strength and potential impact of their proposals. The Foundation remains committed to helping the finalists attract the additional support their critical work requires. 

Sesame Workshop and IRC will use the $100 million grant to implement an evidence-based, early childhood development intervention designed to address the “toxic stress” experienced by children in the Syrian response region—Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria. The project will improve children’s learning outcomes today and their intellectual and emotional development over the long term. 

“We are compelled to respond to the urgent Syrian refugee crisis by supporting what will be the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting,” said MacArthur President Julia Stasch. “Less than two percent of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children. The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education.”

Each of the project’s three components is designed in consultation with local child development and curriculum experts, and each will help caregivers restore nurturing relationships and give their children the tools they need to overcome the trauma of conflict and displacement.

- Customized educational content and a new local version of Sesame Street – Delivered through television, mobile phones, digital platforms, and direct services in homes and communities, pan-Arab content will help provide an estimated 9.4 million young children the language, reading, math, and socioemotional skills they need to succeed in school and later in life. Embedded in the content, Sesame’s Muppets will model inclusion and respect, and gender equity, and they will provide engaging educational messages, always from a child’s perspective. All the content that is created will ultimately be publicly available at no cost. 

- Home visits reinforced with digital content – Home visitation and caregiving support sessions will connect trained local outreach and community health workers to 800,000 caregivers. Home visit content will promote caregiver responsiveness, early learning, mental well-being, and resiliency. The content will engage families through storybooks and picture books, parent brochures, caregiver guides, toys, developmentally appropriate games, digital content, and parenting resources via mobile devices. Direct services in homes and centers will reach 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children. 

- Child development centers – Sesame and IRC will transform community sites, formal and informal schools, and other points of aid into nurturing care and learning centers. Centers will be equipped with storybooks, video clips on pre-loaded projectors, activity sheets, and training guides to enable age-appropriate, play-based learning. 

“The Syrian refugee crisis is the humanitarian issue of our time and we are deeply grateful for this incredible opportunity,” said Jeffrey D. Dunn, President & CEO of Sesame Workshop. “For almost 50 years, Sesame has worked around the world to improve the lives of children and help them to grow smarter, stronger and kinder. This may be our most important initiative ever and we are humbled by the trust and confidence that has been placed in us. These children are, arguably, the world’s most vulnerable and by improving their lives we create a more stable and secure world for us all.”

Sesame Workshop has a long record of developing local versions of Sesame Street in places like Bangladesh, India, Afghanistan and South Africa. And the IRC brings its long and deep engagement in the refugee community and an established network of community workers and local facilities to the partnership. Sesame and IRC will receive the $100 million grant over five years and in accordance with established milestones that ensure the project remains on track. The success of the project will encourage a redirection of existing humanitarian aid, excite new donors, and provide a working model for local government support.

David Miliband, President and CEO of IRC, called the 100&Change grant “a transformational investment that will bring hope and opportunity to a generation of refugee children. This MacArthur grant will create a model for investment in early childhood services around the world. IRC’s partnership with Sesame is an incredible validation of our determination to put education center-stage in humanitarian settings. I hope the new kind of philanthropic thinking embodied by this grant will be an inspiration to others seeking to tackle the world’s largest problems. At a time when governments are in retreat, NGOs and philanthropists need to step up, and that is what we are seeing here – and in a big way.” 

The 100&Change finalists receiving grants of $15 million each over five years are:

- [Catholic Relief Services](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/catholic-relief-services/) – changing how society cares for children in orphanages; 

- [HarvestPlus](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/harvestplus/) – eliminating hidden hunger in Africa by fortifying staple crops; and 

- [Rice 360° Institute for Global Health (Rice University)](https://www.macfound.org/press/semifinalist-profile/rice-360-institute-global-health-rice-university/) – improving newborn survival in Africa. 

“Collectively, these projects identify the opportunity for action to improve long-term prospects for the world’s children. They propose feasible and durable solutions to remediate the effects of family and community disruption, the lack of dietary diversity, and premature birth. All four projects proved worthy of MacArthur’s support,” said Cecilia Conrad, MacArthur’s Managing Director who leads 100&Change. “MacArthur is deeply committed to helping all of them attract the support their critical work requires and finding partners to realize these impactful solutions.”

To help draw attention to and support for the many strong proposals submitted to the competition, MacArthur partnered with Foundation Center to develop the [*100&Change* Solutions Bank](http://100andchange.foundationcenter.org/), a website where nonprofits can find collaborators and funders can search for projects in which to invest. The Solutions Bank is searchable by topics such as geography, subject, strategy, population served, sustainable development goal alignment, and linked research. MacArthur also supported the Center for High Impact Philanthropy (CHIP) at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy & Practice, which analyzed the [top 200](http://100andchange.org/#results/top200) scoring proposals using its lens of social impact. CHIP’s “[Bold Ideas for Philanthropists to Drive Social Change](https://www.impact.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CHIP1217_BoldIdeas_Final.pdf)” guide showcases 81 proposals that stood out for the clarity of their goal and the logic of their proposed solution. Eleven “best bets” were highlighted as having the greatest potential for impact. Third, MacArthur worked closely with [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5027), which identified *100&Change* participants that it rated with four stars, and shared its analysis with its broad audience of individual donors.

*100&Change* is a distinctive competition that invited proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location. There was [robust participation](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/update-100change-robust-participation/): 7,069 competition registrants submitted 1,904 proposals. Of those, 801 passed an initial [administrative review](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/update-100change-applications/) and were evaluated by a [panel of judges](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/panel-wise-heads/) who each provided ratings on [four criteria](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/100change-judging-criteria/): meaningfulness, verifiability, durability, and feasibility. MacArthur’s Board of Directors then selected [eight semi-finalists](http://www.macfound.org/8boldsolutions) and, later, four finalists.

*100&Change* was designed to be fair, open, and transparent. The [identity of the judges](https://www.100andchange.org/#judges) and the [methodology](https://www.100andchange.org/#scoring) used to assess initial proposals are public. Applicants received comments from the judges. Key issues in the competition are discussed in a [blog](https://www.macfound.org/programs/perspectives-100change/) on MacArthur’s website. A searchable [database](http://www.100andchange.org/#explore-submissions) of all the proposals is available online, and the [top 200](http://100andchange.org/#results/top200) scoring proposals are identified. 

Information about the next round of the 100&Change competition will be made available in late 2018.

2391264,"In a Season of Giving, Needed Medicines Reach Still-Recovering Puerto Rico As Puerto Rico celebrates the holidays and looks ahead to a new year, a fresh infusion of medicine arrived Monday – a week before Christmas and three months after Hurricane Maria made landfall.

Over 100 pallets labeled “emergency medical supplies” lined the ABF Freight warehouse in San Juan on Tuesday. Before shipments departed for clinics across the island, health providers and representatives from healthcare companies that donated the medicines and supplies gathered in the storage space.

Employees from BD, Eli Lilly, GSK, Merck, Henry Schein, Mylan and Sanofi spoke about the responsibility to step up and support communities in times of need, as their companies had done. 

“We felt that we owed it to the patients to help them in these terrible times,” Eli Lilly’s Marirosa Rosado told the audience. “We were really proud to help.”

Pharmaceuticals are a main export of Puerto Rico, and many companies have production facilities and offices located across the island. 

Facilities lost power, some were seriously damaged, and all were impacted in some way by Hurricane Maria. 

Employees were no exception.

Some required assistance themselves in the storm’s immediate aftermath. Others took in relatives or neighbors, volunteered their time, worked overtime – nights and weekends – in harsh conditions, doing whatever they could to help their friends, families, anyone in need.

As they spoke, it was evident that everyone experienced the storm’s impacts on a deeply personal level.

“It’s a very good example of what we can do even in the worst of times,” GSK’s Jose Ramirez said.

The supplies began departing the warehouse Tuesday morning, bound for more than 20 health centers across Puerto Rico.

Among the recipients was the Health ProMed clinic in Vieques, an island that was particularly hard-hit by both Hurricanes Irma and Maria.

Each day, power extends to more parts of Puerto Rico. But residents of Vieques are still waiting in long lines for gas to run their generators, going more than 100 days without grid electricity. 

Tuesday’s delivery was packed with essential medicines and supplies requested by staff at that location, which is the only health center on the island.

Salud Integral de Montana in Naranjito, located 20 miles southwest of San Juan, was another health center that received a shipment of critical medicines this week. The only health center for miles around, Salud Integral de Montana serves the mountainous communities on the northern slopes of Cordillera Central.

Each of the other two dozen hospitals and clinics to receive shipments are in similarly precarious positions, post-Maria. Power is unreliable. Many facilities sustained damage. Health center staff return home after long shifts to many of the same challenges their patients face.

The latest shipment won’t solve all of those problems. But more medicine on pharmacy shelves means clinicians have one less thing to worry about.

23 DECEMBER 2017            

The Secretary-General is saddened to learn of the loss of life and devastation caused by Tropical Storm Tembin (known locally as “Vinta”) in Mindanao, the Philippines, in which at least 75 people have lost their lives, with dozens more missing.  Thousands of people have been displaced.  The storm has damaged homes and infrastructure, and landslides remain a threat.

The Secretary-General extends his deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and wishes those injured a speedy recovery.

He salutes the efforts of the national rescue and recovery teams as well as volunteers who are operating under difficult conditions.

The United Nations stands ready to support the local and national authorities, in addition to the support already being provided by humanitarian partners.

2391254,"Bangladesh: Crisis update – December 2017 **Since 25 August, MSF has massively scaled up its operations in Cox's Bazar, [Bangladesh](http://www.msf.org/en/where-we-work/bangladesh).**

**Number of MSF health facilities:** 19 health posts, three primary health centres and four inpatient health facilities

**Number of staff:** 2,258 national and international staff as of the end of November

**Number of patients:** 142,985 patients have been treated at MSF outpatient facilities and 3,117 patients in inpatient facilities between the end of August and the end of November

**Main morbidities:** respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and an increase in diphtheria cases

**Other activities:** water and sanitation (water trucking, hand pump, tube well and latrine installation) and mental health services

We now manage 19 health posts, three primary health centres and four inpatient facilities. Around 2,300 people work for MSF in the Cox’s Bazar district. The main morbidities among patients in our clinics are respiratory tract infections, diarrhoeal diseases and increasing cases of infant malnutrition, which are directly related to the poor living conditions, particularly the state of shelter, water and sanitation in the settlements.

By the end of November, we saw 2,165 cases of measles across all MSF health facilities and more than 77 cases of jaundice.

In addition, the number of suspected diphtheria cases we see at our health facilities has increased. By 21 December, we had treated more than 2,000 patients, most of whom were aged between five and 14 years.

Without an antitoxin, diphtheria can result in a high case-fatality rate. Only a limited quantity arrived in Bangladesh recently.

Active case investigation began in most of the settlements where MSF is working to see if anyone else was sick in the patients’ households. We also collected information about the number of household members and any other contacts the patients had prior to presentation. Contacts are being treated prophylactically with antibiotics via the health facilities. The preparation and establishment of a reserved isolation area for suspected cases are ongoing.

Most of these vaccine-preventable diseases are further examples of how little access the Rohingya population in Myanmar had to routine healthcare. We’ve worked on expanding our isolation capacity for measles and other infectious diseases in most of our facilities.

In response to inpatient capacity needs, we’ve increased the number of beds at our facilities in Kutupalong and our newly-built health facility in Balukhali. We’ve also opened a new 25-bed inpatient facility in the Tasnimarkhola settlement. It’s the only inpatient centre in the area. Another, which was due to open near Moynarghona makeshift settlement, is functioning as a temporary 85-bed diphtheria treatment centre.

In preparation for a potential outbreak of cholera or other diarrhoeal diseases, we have identified sites for diarrhoea treatment units in Balukhali, Hakimpara, Jamtoli, and Unchiprang. Preparations are ongoing.

**MSF project locations in Cox’s Bazar**

**Kutupalong**

More than 547,000 refugees are now living in makeshift settlements in Kutupalong and Balukhali, as well as the expansion site. The MSF Kutupalong health facility has operated since 2009 and is our biggest in Cox’s Bazar. Among the services in this clinic are: a 24-hour emergency room; an outpatient department; an inpatient department, which includes a paediatric and neonatal ward; isolation beds; a diarrhoea treatment ward; sexual and reproductive healthcare services; a mental health department, and basic laboratory services.

Since 25 August, the inpatient department has expanded from 50 to 79 beds to cope with the influx and the increasing numbers of patients. Its isolation capacity was also increased to cope with a potential outbreak of communicable diseases. The outpatient department treats more than 300 patients per day. We plan to rehabilitate the hospital, increase the number of beds and improve the overall infrastructure in the hospital to meet the needs of the growing population. Construction work began in November and will continue through to the new year.

MSF has built and manages three health posts in Kutupalong makeshift settlement expansion area. The health posts treat over 300 patients per day and are located throughout the settlement to provide access to newly arrived refugees.

**Balukhali**

At the end of October, we opened a 40-bed mother and child inpatient facility in Balukhali, near the existing outpatient clinic. In early December, this was converted into a diphtheria treatment centre in response to the rapidly growing outbreak of the disease. We now have 70 beds in the facility for treating diphtheria patients. We also run three health posts in this settlement.

**Balukhali 2**

Since 1 October, MSF has run a health post in Balukhali 2, which has a population of 285, 000. The health provides basic primary healthcare and treated more than 18,100 people between 1 October and 11 December. Newly arrived refugees are being settled in the zone named SS, which includes Balukhali 1 and Balukali 2. On 18 November, MSF opened a health post in the SS zone that treats an average of 170 patients per day.

**Tasnimarkhola**

More than 58,000 refugees live in Tasnimarkhola’s makeshift settlement, formerly known as Burma Para. MSF opened a health post on 26 October and treated 12,400 patients by 11 December. Around 30 per cent of consultations there are for children under five. On 3 December, we started sexual and reproductive health activities (antenatal, postnatal, sexual and gender-based violence, gynaecological consultations and family planning).

On 26 November, we opened a 25-bed inpatient facility. The hospital focuses on paediatrics (children below the age of 15), inpatient treatment of severe acute malnutrition (10 per cent of hospitalised patients) and the management of measles cases (55 per cent of hospitalised patients). To accommodate the high number of measles cases, we had to increase the number of isolation beds to 36. By 11 December we received 320 patients in the emergency room. Of these, 171 (53 per cent) were hospitalised.

We’ve drilled four deep production boreholes to provide water to the health posts and inpatient department.

**Unchiprang**

More than 23,300 refugees live in Unchiprang’s makeshift settlement. MSF runs a primary health centre, which initially opened as health post in mid-September. We provide around-the-clock primary healthcare, sexual and reproductive healthcare and mental health services, with 10 hospitalisation beds. We are the main health-care provider in the settlement and our team carries out more than 150 consultations per day. We’ve opened a second health post in Uchiprang and another in nearby Nayapara and treat 200 cases daily in both.

**Jamtoli**

Jamtoli makeshift settlement has a population of 48,400. The health post MSF opened there in September was later upgraded later to a primary healthcare centre. The clinic currently receives up to 250 patients per day and offers 24-hour primary health care service, with a delivery room and 18 hospitalisation beds. We run two other health posts in Jamtoli.

**Hakimpara**

More than 33,000 refugees live in Hakimpara’s makeshift settlement. The health post we opened there has been upgraded to a primary healthcare centre with 24-hour primary health care services and 14 hospitalisation beds. We treat around 150 patients per day there. We also run two other health posts.

**Moynarghona**

More than 19,500 refugees live in Moynarghona’s makeshift settlement. MSF started a mobile clinic in September, which has since been upgraded to a health post. The clinic sees an average of 200 patients per day. Before the end of the year, we plan to open an inpatient department with a 63- bed capacity outside the settlement. It will offer an emergency room and a paediatric and inpatient therapeutic feeding centre for the Rohingya and host communities. In the meantime, this site has been used as an 85-bed diphtheria treatment centre since 11 December.

**Sabrang entry point**

On 8 October, we started a mobile clinic at the border point in Sabrang, offering nutritional screening and basic healthcare and monitoring. Its services have been integrated into the reception centre’s circuit.

**Other activities**

**Vaccination**

MSF is vaccinating children and pregnant women in its facilities to support the government’s initiative to expand routine vaccination in the camps. Staff at all our health facilities will have the capacity to administer immunisation for measles and rubella, oral polio and tetanus according to national protocols.

From 18 November, the Ministry of Health ran a 12-day measles and rubella vaccination catch-up campaign targeting more than 336,000 children between the age of six months and 15 years. MSF supported this campaign with community mobilisation, site identification, logistics and the transportation of vaccines. A vaccination coverage survey is planned in mid-December to evaluate the success of the campaign.

**Sexual violence**

**Key figures:**

- **Total number of sexual violence cases from 25 August to 3 December:** 113

- **Number of rape cases:** 91

- **Number of sexual and gender-based violence cases under the age of 18:** 37

- **Number of cases of male on male sexual violence:** 0

Since 25 August, we've treated 113 survivors of sexual violence at our sexual and reproductive health unit in Kutupalong. Of these, 33 per cent were under the age of 18, including one under the age of ten.

Estimating the number of survivors is not possible. But sexual violence is often under-reported due to stigma and shame, fear of reprisals, a lack of knowledge about the medical consequences of sexual violence and the need for timely medical care, and a lack of awareness about the medical and psychological support available.

Given these barriers, it is likely that the number of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence MSF has treated so far is just a fraction of reality.

We are starting to see more survivors seeking medical care because some of these women and girls have become pregnant as a result of rape.

MSF has specialised staff on the ground to treat survivors who are referred for treatment as a result of trauma, including sexual assault and rape. Our local community outreach workers visit people living in the settlements and inform them about our free services, which include treatment for sexual violence.

**Water and Sanitation (WASH)**

Beyond our medical response, improving water and sanitation is a major part of our attempts to prevent the spread of disease. According to the WHO[[1]](http://www.msf.org/en/article/bangladesh-crisis-update-%E2%80%93-december-2017#_ftn1), 91 per cent of households and 60 per cent of source samples were contaminated with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Due to the lack of a drainage system, stagnant water is present in 26 per cent of all tube wells. As for sanitation, 39 per cent of emergency latrines installed by WASH partners, mostly at the early stage of the emergency response, are non-functional. The desludging and decommissioning of these latrines remains a priority to improve the inadequate sanitation environment.

MSF is targeting its water and sanitation response in the most difficult to reach areas. So far, we have built 1,247 latrines, 157 water wells and a gravity water supply system in the settlements located in the north and south.

By the end of December, we aim to install 400 boreholes and 1,000 latrines in the Balukhali and Kutupalong makeshift settlements. As the shallow aquifer (the main water source, abundant in quantity and easy to access) is contaminated with fecal coliforms throughout the camps, we started drilling production boreholes between 150 and 200 metres deep to have clean water. To date, four deep boreholes have been drilled.

We plan to start hygiene promotion, clean latrines, educate about hand washing, and distribute soap and other non-food items in MSF facilities. To ensure vulnerable population have clean drinking water, we also plan to distribute water filters in our clinics in Tasnimarkhola and Balukali 2 to patients with malnutrition and measles, and pregnant women. In the southern settlements of Unchiprang and Jamtoli, we aim to build 56 more latrines and 43 wells in the coming weeks.

Our emergency response for new arrivals also includes water supply and sanitation. We have deployed teams to arrival, transit and settlement locations to ensure that newly arrived refugees have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities.

As the settlements continue to expand, refugees have inequitable access to basic needs such as healthcare services, food and water. The military is currently working on a new road but additional improvements and humanitarian services are urgently needed to ensure aid is reaching all those with basic needs and to limit further hardship and the risk of public health problems.

2391249,"Strengthening farmer organizations as agents of peace in Colombia A new project of ICCO Cooperation in Colombia has been approved for signing by the European Union’s Trust Fund. In the project, farmer organizations will be strengthened as central agents in the construction of peace.

The project will be carried out in the framework of the implementation of the peace accord, signed in November of 2016 between the Colombian government and the FARC. One of the proposals in this accord is to improve the economic conditions in the country and dignify the living conditions of the rural population, which are fundamental steps towards achieving a peace. This project will contribute to that.

**Target groups**

The project aims at benefiting 2,500 people (youths, women, producers and ethnic and farmer communities), 12 producer and farmer organizations and 12 businesses in the agricultural sector.

A specific target group are smallholders, as improving the living conditions of the rural populations is an important step in the peace process. Furthermore, business initiatives of youths will be supported in the sectors of tourism, gastronomy and hospitality. The project will also promote the participation of women, indigenous and peasant communities in the formulation of the Plans for Development, led by the national government of Colombia.

**Agribusiness Booster**

Together with [AgriBusiness Booster](https://www.icco-cooperation.org/en/Expertise/Agribusiness-Booster), ICCO will co-entrepreneur in the project with small and medium-sized businesses which will be linked to the agricultural chain. Therefore an investment fund will be created for agro-productive initiatives. At the end of the project, the fund will be sustained by ICCO and Agribusiness Booster.

**Consortium**

The project will be implemented by a consortium led by ICCO with the participation of Agribusiness Booster, CETEC, PAX, JUSTAPAZ, Renacer, UNIPA and the National Platform of Rural Women, in alliance with the ministries of agriculture and local governments.

They could not afford contraceptives. Ou Lu became pregnant every two years.

Then, after giving birth to her sixth child, she was able to access the 3-month contraceptive injection for free. Life started to look up for the family.

“When I didn’t have to breastfeed and take care of a new baby, I was able to take on work outside my home and earn some extra money. We used it for school uniforms and books”, says Ou Lu. “But with my husband mostly away, I have so many responsibilities. One time I was not able to visit the clinic in time for my contraceptive refill, and I got pregnant again.”

The reproductive health assistant demonstrates the implant.

**“I feel safe now”**

Her youngest child is a lovely little boy with a cheeky smile. But her feelings about becoming a mother for the seventh time are mixed. She has had to give up her work. Without the extra income, her older children now stay at home instead of going to school. There is not enough money for uniforms and books. So when Ou Lu heard about the contraceptive implant, she did not hesitate.

“With the implant, I cannot get pregnant for five years. I have worried so much about this for such a long time. Now I finally feel safe. I trust the doctor. The implant is a good thing for my family and I”, says Ou Lu.

**Five years of protection**

Contraceptive implants are long-acting reversible contraceptives. Inserted under the skin of the upper arm with a small incision, the implant prevents unintended pregnancy for up to five years. But it is also reversible. If a woman would like to try for another baby, the implant is removed, and she can become pregnant again.

Over the last three years, UNFPA has invested overUS$2 million in implants in Myanmar. Through a collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Sports, implants are offered for free in public health facilities. NGO partners provide the implants for free or for a reduced price.

**Exhausted but happy**

By the end of the day, Dr Sett Aung Naing and his team are exhausted but also happy. Dozens of women have received contraceptive implants, as well as family planning counselling and other types of contraceptives, today. But although the team have worked tirelessly not everyone has had their turn.

“We have so many villages to serve that we can only come a few times per year to each village”, says Dr Sett as he wipes his brow in the heat of the late afternoon.

“But I just cannot leave these women to wait for months for family planning advice and contraceptives. Even if it’s a long journey, the team and I have decided to change our schedules so that we can return to Bhyat Kha tomorrow morning so that everyone who’s come to see us will be served.”

2391234,"Census workshops build unity in communities emerging from conflict “Nothing would be better than seeing many groups in communities come together and discuss for the common good” says U Yee Thant, a Senior Officer, Department of Immigration, Hpa-An District.

In the past, in places like Hpa-An in Myanmar’s Kayin State that are emerging from prolonged conflict, there was rarely an atmosphere that allowed for face to face interaction between local communities and government representatives. But a remarkable coexistence between previous adversaries emerges during the township workshop, facilitated by UNFPA, to discuss the local results from the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census. U Yee Thant readily concedes that it was not easy to convince people and organizations to show up at a workshop, let alone share their opinions and questions. Yet, the census dissemination workshops held in Hlaingbwe, Myawaddy and Hpa-An townships have enabled and empowered both individuals and groups to discuss the census results and their implications for local priorities and planning.

The 2014 census was the first to be conducted in over 30 years. The results provide vital data for socio-economic planning, resource allocation, projection and decision-making across the country. Census dissemination workshops have been taking place in townships throughout the country to promote data utilization in local communities, supporting the participants to develop a better understanding of census data for their day-to-day activities.

**A platform for peacebuilding**

In Hpa-An as in other conflict-affected townships, the workshop dialogue is not just a discussion about policy and development, it also forms an additional platform for the ongoing reconciliation, civic engagement and peacebuilding. The workshops unfolded a place where everyone is included, and where everyone can work together despite divergent needs and interests.

During the workshops, government agencies, ethnic armed organizations, civil society organizations, youth groups and individuals worked on pragmatic issues of interest to all, such as education, employment, living conditions and healthcare. The census data provides a baseline for setting shared and consolidated goals for the township’s development, including peaceful coexistence.

**Developing a blueprint for youth development**

The data is very useful for approaching youth policy and planning. Now I understand how to use the data as a reference. By knowing the facts about our youth population, their education levels and their job situation here at the boundaries of Myanmar, we can develop a blueprint for youth development in our own community”, says Saw Sein Htwe from the Nyein Foundation, which is a peace building non-profit organization in Hpa-An.

“Before, many groups have shown little interest in coming together. But the census dissemination workshop attracted groups from all parts of our society. People even asked for more such workshops to be held in the future, and I hope that we can do something similar again”, says U Yee Thant.",267,"English"
2391214,"GIEWS Country Brief: Lesotho 20-December-2017 **FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT**

- Dry conditions during planting period of 2018 cereal crops

- However, rainfall prospects generally favourable for remainder of current 2017/18 season

- Maize production in 2017 estimated at well aboveaverage level

- Ample cereal supplies result in reduced import requirements for 2017/18 marketing year and increased stock levels

- Food security conditions improved significantly, mostly on account of increased agricultural output

**Dry conditions at start of 2017/18 cropping season**

Land preparation and planting for the 2018 cereal crops is underway and is expected to be finalized by the end of the year. Abnormal dry conditions were observed during most of September and November, resulting in below-average vegetation conditions in cropped areas in the main cereal-producing northern regions. However, heavier rains were recorded at the beginning of December and meteorological forecasts point to a higher likelihood of above-average rainfall in the first quarter of 2018. Should the favourable rains materialize, the current moisture deficits are expected to be reversed with a positive effect on 2018 production prospects.

**Production rebounded strongly in 2017**

Based on the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics’ agricultural assessment, cereal production in 2017 is estimated at a well above-average level of 238 000 tonnes, a significant increase compared to the drought-reduced level of 2016. Most of this increase reflects a sharp upturn in maize production, estimated at 200 000 tonnes. In addition, there was a sharp increase for sorghum production, while the wheat output is estimated at an average level, but still well above the previous year’s output.

**Import requirements drop in 2017/18**

As a result of the bumper 2017 output, cereal import requirements are estimated at a well below-average level of 177 000 tonnes in the 2017/18 marketing year (April/March). Of this amount, imports of maize would account for 65 000 tonnes.

In addition, given the favourable supply situation, stock levels are forecast to rise sharply in 2017/18 to near average levels.

**Decreased number of food insecure**

The food security situation has improved markedly in 2017/18 compared to the previous year where an estimated 709 000 people required food assistance. Based on the latest 2017 Lesotho Vulnerability Assessment Committee’s (LVACs) evaluation, the number of food insecure people in 2017/18 is estimated at about 225 000. The year-on-year decline is mostly attributed to the upturn in this year’s agricultural output.",267,"English"

2391144,"WHO helps Nigeria control cholera in Borno state **Maiduguri, Nigeria, 22 December 2017** - Nigeria has successfully contained a five-month cholera outbreak in conflict-affected Borno state, with support from the World Health Organization and other health partners.

The Government [announced](https://reliefweb.int/node/2391139/) the end of the outbreak on Thursday (December 21) after two weeks had passed with no new cases.

“With the support of WHO and other health actors, Borno State moved to quick action to control the outbreak. With that strong resolve to limit mortality and morbidity, this was achieved, and we can say that we have succeeded,” said Dr Muhammad Aminu Ghuluze, Director of Emergency Response, Borno State Ministry of Health.

A major Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign contributed to the effort – the first of its kind in Nigeria.

With support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) provided 1.8 million OCV doses to immunize 900,000 people in two rounds between September and December this year.

Following an initial spike in cases, the number of new infections dropped significantly after the vaccination campaign concluded.

“Containing cholera in the midst of an ongoing conflict is a major accomplishment,” said Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Representative in Nigeria. “No single measure would have worked on its own. This was a joint effort employing a range of tools by many partners under the leadership of the State Ministry of Health.”

The outbreak began in August on the outskirts of Maiduguri, and quickly spread through several camps for internally displaced persons and host communities. By 19 December, 5,365 suspected cases had been reported, including 61 deaths.

An early warning and surveillance system supported by WHO was critical to providing data on suspected cases in different locations. WHO pinpointed where the outbreak was expanding and contracting through a GIS “dot mapping” approach, which allowed WHO and partners to effectively target interventions.

The response included providing safe chlorinated water, identifying and treating the sick in established cholera treatment centres, reaching out to communities with information on cholera prevention, and facilitating laboratory testing to confirm new cases.

Partnerships with local media helped to ensure that people in affected and neighbouring communities were aware of the risk of cholera, how it is spread, how to prevent it, and the importance of seeking treatment when they experience the symptoms.

Due to ongoing conflict, many people in north-eastern Nigeria have not had access to basic healthcare and routine immunizations for years, and health conditions in many camps for internally displaced persons are sub-standard.

WHO is working with the Government and health sector partners to improve access to basic health services, including to areas considered inaccessible until only recently. However, a recent uptick in the conflict in Borno and neighbouring states has led to new displacements increasing the future risks of disease outbreaks.

“While the achievements of the cholera programme in Borno State are a significant milestone, cholera is endemic to north-eastern Nigeria and future outbreaks remain likely,” said Dr Alemu. “We must be vigilant to the warning signs that could signal another outbreak of cholera or other epidemic-prone diseases.”

In line with the [Global Roadmap for Ending Cholera by 2030](http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap.pdf), WHO will continue to support Nigeria to prepare for and prevent cholera by focussing on prevention and preparedness in hotspots across the country.

**Note to editors**

10.2 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in north-eastern Nigeria. More than half are women and girls. Children make up 63 per cent of those needing assistance. The most acute humanitarian needs are concentrated in Borno State – and areas bordering Borno in Adamawa and Yobe states – where the crisis shows no sign of abating.

To continue providing basic health services, while looking to rebuild north-eastern Nigeria’s health system, the health sector is seeking US$109.5 million to help 5.1 million people in 2018.",267,"English"
2391139,"Address to the media on the end of cholera outbreak in Borno State December 21, 2017 Maiduguri, Borno State 

Distinguished colleagues, the members of the media community, champions of humanitarianism, friends, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning all and a warm welcome. 

I must thank you all for your time and above all for the courage to have remained steadfast during the period of this cholera outbreak. 

We are all here today because we have contributed one way or the other to control the outbreak that we have come to close. On 16 August this year, the State government through the State ministry of Health got report of cases suspected to be cholera in the Muna garage IDP camp. With the support of WHO and other health actors moved to quick action to control outbreak, with that strong resolve to limit mortality and morbidity, this was achieved, and we can say that we have succeeded. A little over 5000 cases was recorded across 6 Local governments area in Borno state, Jere, MMC, Dikwa, Monguno, Mafa and Guzamala LGAs and with 61 deaths reported. 

The cholera outbreak ongoing in other parts of the world was a wake-up call, that if we toy with it, it will toy with us. Given the weakened health system resulting from long years of insurgency and the high population density in Muna garage camp, made it paramount for immediate and coordinated response to avoid pit falls experienced by other nations with similar challenges. I must say that we have succeeded in controlling the outbreak. 

This, certainly was as a result of the multi sectoral strategy adopted and the very strong partner leadership from WHO in coordinating with other implementing partners to support the state in closing identified gaps in surveillance, risk communication, water and sanitation among others. The preparedness of the health cluster to respond to cholera outbreak, effective partner coordination, swift activation of the Emergency Operations Center, efficient case management and surveillance were the strong points that helped us disrupt transmission and reduced mortality to about 1%, as this could have been worse given previous outbreak like that in 2010. Today, we are more than 2 weeks without any case reported and this signifies that we have come to the end of this outbreak. 

Our collaborative effort proved very useful in this instance and has shown that working together we achieve faster and better. Building partnerships across all sectors is the only sure way to work now and in the future. 

The state will now be far prepared and equipped to prevent and respond even better in the event of another outbreak. Now, we must begin to document and harness the lessons learnt, as a contribution to assurance of our collective future.    

I want to thank all partners that supported the implementation of prevention and control strategies, management of cases and providing technical support to our staff on ground.    

We must also seize this as an opportunity to continue to educate and enlighten our people on these strategies as to avert a next occurrence. We still ask that the UN agencies and other partners to continue the good work, keep supporting the state government and her agencies in the quest to provide improved health services for the people of Borno, especially the displaced.    

I must thank specially WHO for that Leadership in the response, Unicef, Oxfam, Solidarite International for support in Water and sanitation, MSF, FHI 360, MDM, ALIMA in case Management and a host of others that I may not have mentioned. We must also recognize the various roles played by the Federal Ministry of Health and her agencies, NCDC, NPHCDA in disrupting this outbreak and collaboration of own MOH staff and other state agencies, SPHCDA, BOSEPA, RUWASSA. The State government and people of Borno state cannot thank you enough.    

By this we declare the cholera outbreak over.    

Thank you,

**Description of the disaster** 

As Tropical Storm Tembin (local name: Vinta), aims to exits Philippine landmass, the trail of destruction it has left is emerging. Latest information indicates that Tembin has caused dozens – potentially hundreds – of fatalities, damaged thousands of houses, washed away vast amounts of livelihoods and disrupted the lives of people mainly in northern and central parts of Mindanao Island in the Philippines.  

According to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Tropical Storm Tembin made landfall in Cateel,  Davao Oriental, on Friday 22 December 2017 afternoon packing maximum winds of 90 kilometres per hour (km/h) and gusts of up to 125 km/h. The tropical storm then continued across Mindanao, tracking over the provinces of Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental and Zamboanga del Norte. It weakened before re-intensifying late Saturday, 23 December, and is now threatening southern parts of Palawan. In a bulletin issued at 17:00h local time on Saturday, PAGASA indicated that Tembi was packing maximum winds of 90 km/h and gustiness of up to 115 km/h.  

According to a report issued by the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s – Fifth DROMIC Report on TS Tembin – as of 23 December 2017 morning the following had been recorded:

• 18,177 families or 72,592 persons are affected in 312 barangays in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, and CARAGA   

• A total of 12,768 families or 50,362 persons are currently staying inside 211 evacuation centres in Regions MMAROPA, X, XI, CARAGA  

There are reports of widespread flooding as the major rivers breached their banks. There have also been several reports of flash floods and landslides. Initial reports indicate that at least 106 people have lost their lives, i.e. 47 in Zamboanga del Norte, 36 in Lanao del Norte, 18 in Lanao del Sur, and 5 in Bukidnon. Dozen are missing, with the number of fatalities likely to increase. Confirmed numbers are expected in the coming days as the public authorities verify information being received from the affected provinces.  

Government agencies and local responders – including from the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) – are currently undertaking search and rescue operations. Photos shared by rescuers on social media show rampaging, mud-brown floodwaters sweeping down a highway in Lanao del Sur province, engulfing houses and a van, and people seeking refuge on the upper floors of their homes. There are reports of widespread flooding in Cagayan de Oro, one of Mindanao's largest cities, as well as in Zamboanga City. In Davao City, hundreds of families were evacuated their homes on Friday 22 December night as a major Bankerohan river overflowed, flooding several barangays affecting some 31,000 families.  

The situation continues to evolve and more information should emerge in the coming days. What remains clear is that there is a need for a substantial humanitarian response to help meet the immediate needs of affected communities. Already, some of the affected provinces have been placed under a state of calamity, mainly to allow local government units to utilize budget allocations for immediate response.",267,"English"

In the Meri refugee camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 30,000 South Sudanese refugees yearn to return to their homeland, which has been ripped apart by a four-year civil war.

The new cease-fire signed Thursday between the government of President Salva Kiir and different rebel groups should raise hopes of peace in the war-torn country.

But the refugees in Meri camp who spoke to VOA said they are not celebrating just yet.

""We hear, but we don't know whether it is going to be,"" said Rose Tabu, a 20-year-old mother of one who came to Congo last year to escape fighting. ""We just leave it in God, since last time we hear 'peace peace peace,' but there is not peace.""

The cease-fire stipulates the two sides must stop military activities, allow access for aid groups, and uphold the laws of war, including not committing atrocities against civilians.

Lilias Arie, 24, urged the warring parties to stop targeting civilians. She said government soldiers had attacked civilians, while the rebel group led by former vice president Riek Machar, called the SPLA-IO, had stolen property.

""Since the fighting is between the IO and the government soldiers, why are they killing civilians, harassing civilians, even burning houses, why?"" Arie said. ""Let them not kill civilians. Salva should tell his soldiers to not kill civilians. And Riek should come to the table to find a solution to this war.""

Lino Lasuba, 32, said he did not have high hopes because many previous cease-fires have fallen apart.

""Of course, this is not the first signing of peace in South Sudan, several peace [deals] have been signed, so at the end of the day, what we expected changed to be the contrary,"" Lasuba said.

As the cease-fire goes into effect Sunday, South Sudanese refugees in Congo will be watching closely to see if peace will hold — and whether they can finally return home.",267,"English"

YAOUNDE — Several villages are said to have been set ablaze in Cameroon's English speaking southwestern town of Mamfe after armed separatists attacked military installations and killed four soldiers. The Cameroon government says it has seized three of the armed separatists' training camps.

Cameroon communication minister and government spokesperson Issa Tchiroma says for the past two weeks, military and armed separatist groups have been involved in bloody conflicts in the English speaking southwestern town of Mamfe on the border with Nigeria.

""Several suspects have been arrested, large quantities of war and hunting weapons as well as hundreds of military ammunition and uniforms have also been seized,"" Tchiroma said. ""One of those attacks has unfortunately claimed the lives of four of our gendarmes who were cold bloodedly killed this Monday December 18 in Kembong, Eyumojock sub division in Manyu division.""

Thchiroma refused to give the number of armed separatists killed by security forces in ensuing clashes, but disclosed that at least three border villages that hosted training camps for the fighters had been liberated.

Villagers say there has been an unprecedented harsh crackdown by the military, which also used helicopters to fire on civilians.

Kembong resident Victor Arrey Ndip says his village and two others have been completely destroyed by the fighting and many people are dying.

""They have bumped three villages so every body should be very careful with what is happening on the ground now,"" Ndip said. ""As I am telling you, people are dying in their numbers in Mamfe.""

Mamfe is a town in Manyu, an administrative area on Cameroon's border with Nigeria where Cameroon says some of the fighters are trained. It has a vast expanse of forests, which the government says favors guerilla warfare with hit and run tactics from armed separatists.

The violence has pushed thousands of Cameroonians across the border to Nigeria since early October, when the separatists said they had declared their independence.

Schools have been closed in most of the English speaking northwest and southwest regions since November last year, when lawyers and teachers protested the overuse of French in the bilingual country. Violence erupted when separatists joined and called for complete independence.

President Paul Biya has made it clear that he will not negotiate on separation, saying the country is indivisible.

When the separatists started attacking military positions, he declared war on them, describing the separatists as terrorists.",267,"English"
2391094,"UNAMI Underlines an Urgent Need for De-escalation Following Violent Demonstrations in Sulaimaniya [EN/AR/KU] Sulaimaniya, 23 December 2017 – Senior representatives from the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) emphasised in meetings held in Sulaimaniya on 21-22 December with government officials, political party leaders and civil society representatives, the urgency of de-escalating ongoing local tensions in the aftermath of demonstrations that had turned violent and led to arrests, injury and, regrettably, loss of life. 

The delegation called on a variety of leaders across the political and social spectrum. They included the deputy Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, H.E. Mr. Qubad Talabani; Governor of Sulaimaniya, Dr. Haval Abubakir; Provincial Council Chairman Mr. Azad Hama Ameen; leaders of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the Gorran Change Movement, Kurdistan Islamic Union (KIU), Kurdistan Islamic Group (KIG), Coalition for Democracy and Justice and the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in Suleimaniya; as well as activists, civil society organisations and citizens directly affected by the crisis. 

The purpose of the meetings was to underline the deep concern of the United Nations over the violence that accompanied demonstrations in the past few days, including the shooting of demonstrators and the torching of political party offices and public buildings in areas of the Sulaimaniya Governorate. 

The delegation reaffirmed the fundamental right of people to engage in peaceful demonstrations, in keeping with the law. They underlined the importance of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) handling protests in a restrained manner, in keeping with established modern police techniques, so as to avoid further escalation. The mission’s representatives highlighted the authorities’ responsibility to protect their citizens, including peaceful protestors, and safeguard their human rights; they urged the security forces to ensure the safety and dignity of demonstrators. 

The UNAMI team also made it clear that protestors themselves were responsible for ensuring that their voices were heard in accordance with the confines of the law, and did not resort to violence against the security forces nor engage in the destruction of public and private properties. 

UNAMI recognises that amongst the grievances raised by the protestors, the issue of security of citizens’ livelihoods in the face of the ongoing budgetary crisis is paramount. The UNAMI representatives reiterated the readiness of the Mission, in the event of a request from both parties, to use its good offices to support negotiations between the federal government in Baghdad and the KRG, working within the framework of the Iraqi constitution and focusing on all pending issues, including but not limited to the allocations in the federal budget, the payment of salaries and border controls, in response to the needs of all Iraq’s citizens in the aftermath of the hard-won victory over ISIL. 

The delegation inquired about the detention of demonstrators by the authorities, and specifically about the treatment of Shaswar Abdulwahid, leader of the New Generation Movement, and Rabun Maaruf, member of the Kurdistan Regional Parliament. UNAMI calls upon the authorities to conduct a transparent and fair process to address the activities of all those involved in the use of violence or the incitement thereof, within the confines of the law.

(See SMM Daily Report 22 December 2017.)

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 21 December, while on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard a burst of heavy-machine-gun fire and three shots of small-arms fire 2km south (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

On the same day, the SMM also heard and saw an undetermined explosion 500-700m south (assessed as outside the disengagement area) and heard two undetermined explosions 1-3km north-west (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

Positioned 2km east of government-controlled Bohdanivka (41km south-west of Donetsk), west of the Petrivske disengagement area, the SMM heard two undetermined explosions, five bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire and three shots of infantry fighting vehicle (BMP-2) cannon (30mm) fire, all 2-5km south-south-east (assessed as outside the disengagement area).

During the day on 22 December, positioned near the Stanytsia Luhanska and Zolote disengagement areas, the SMM observed a calm situation.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in a government-controlled area, an SMM mid-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted, on 21 December, eight self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm) on the western edge of Oleksandropil (43km north of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in government-controlled areas, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted, on 21 December, 16 towed howitzers (D-20, 152mm) in Novoolenivka (48km north-west of Donetsk), eight tanks (T-64) in Zelene Pole (40km north-west of Donetsk) and seven tanks (T-72) near Kalynove (31km north-west of Donetsk).

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In a government-controlled area, beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw four anti-tank guns (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm) for the first time.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles[2] in the security zone. In a government-controlled area, the SMM saw a reconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) in Buhas (44km south-west of Donetsk).

The SMM observed long queues at the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge. On 22 December, positioned near an “LPR” checkpoint on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, the SMM saw about 1,000 people queuing to exit government-controlled areas and about 2,000 in the opposite direction. 

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Chernivtsi and Kyiv.",267,"English"
2391079,"Spreading Christmas cheer to Dominican children affected by hurricane Maria Friday, December 22, 2017 — The OECS Commission partnered with Ectel, the Embassy of New-Zealand, and the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court to provide Christmas gifts to over two hundred (200) Dominican children affected by hurricane Maria.

The Dominica Toy Drive launched on November 17, recently ended collecting 250 toys. Additionnal 250 snacks were purchased with funds from the Commission's Social Committee Account.

Staff of the OECS Commission headquarters based in Saint-Lucia reached the Nature Island on December 18th to coordinate the distribution along with the OECS Competitive Business Unit which offices are located in Roseau.

Marlon Marie, ag. Head of the Competitive Business Unit, explained that it was an extremely humbling and satisfying experience:

**It means a lot to be able to bring some joy to the hearts to the children of Dominica. Many of them would have lost all their worldly belongings but for a brief moment to see their eyes light up at the gifts that they received gave a bit of hope for their future.**

The toys and snacks have been packed by the staff of the OECS Commission who handed them in six different schools across the country.

Sally-Ann Alfred, Assistant in the legal unit, and Josette Edwards, Assistant in the Environmental Cluster, added that they were happy to take part of this mission and expressed gratitude to all the stakeholders contributed to the success of this initiative:

**It was quite a rewarding experience to be able to bring smiles to so many innocent faces. Through the few moments we spent with these kids, I felt like we had in a very small way helped to alleviate part of the burden that Maria had placed on their shoulders. Mrs Alfred said.**

**The smiles and the expressions on the faces of those children said it all. They were elated when they saw the gifts. Not knowing what was in the packages did not matter to them, just the thought of getting a present was all. Mrs Edwards concluded.**

Dominica is still aggressively grappling with the challenge of restoring normality in its education system with the help of its development partners.",267,"English"

2391069,"Fezzan representatives adopt a charter for reconciliation Tunis, 22 December 2017 - More than 55 representatives from the South of Libya concluded a three-days Forum in Tunis by adopting a general Charter for Reconciliation. The participants included elders and wisemen from various tribal components of the South, community leaders, members of municipal councils, youth and women activists, local mediators, and civil society organizations.

The South Reconciliation Forum offered a platform for the various social components in the South to discuss the main challenges to peace in Fezzan, and to agree on a set of principles and mechanisms for local and national reconciliation. Participants stressed the pivotal position of Fezzan in the Libyan political and social landscape, in the hope that it will become a future symbol for reconciliation. They acknowledged, however, that initiatives to end the tribal wars in the Fezzan over the past six years have failed to build a solid peace. 

The South Reconciliation Forum therefore contributed to launching an inclusive dialogue leading to the elaboration of a Reconciliation Charter between the main stakeholders of the region. The signatory parties to the South Reconciliation Charter will seek to build wider support for it and encourage a greater number of constituencies to abide to it.

The Charter can be accessible here:

2391064,"UNHCR welcomes agreement to revive South Sudan’s stalled peace process UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, welcomes the recent agreement by the South Sudan government and opposition groups to revive the stalled peace process, and calls for the inclusion of refugees in shaping the destiny of the country.

The agreement was signed on December 21 between the rival parties of the conflict in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia during the High-Level Revitalization Forum. It aims to revitalize the 2015 peace agreement, cease hostilities, ease humanitarian access, ensure civilian protection and introduce sanctions on those violating the accord.

‘‘The latest initiative comes as a ray of hope for South Sudanese who have witnessed the ravages of war since 2013,’’ said Arnauld Akodjenou, UNHCR Special Envoy for the South Sudan situation.

Akodjenou said he hoped South Sudan will achieve peace and that parties will not dash the hopes of millions who have endured suffering for far too long.

‘‘We are calling for unreserved support to translate this agreement on paper into silencing the guns throughout South Sudan,’’ he added.

UNHCR is particularly heartened that the agreement upholds the rights of the South Sudan refugees and those displaced inside the country with references to assure the civilian character of settlements - urging the parties to actively pursue solutions on their behalf. 

The Agreement is expected to breathe a new life into a fraught peace process and will renew aspirations for peace among the four million people driven from their homes in the world’s youngest nation - including 2 million refugees hosted in six neighbouring asylum countries who have witnessed several peace initiatives come to pass without results.

2391059,"Summary of UNAMI Findings in Tuz Khurmatu [EN/AR/KU] Baghdad, 23 December 2017 - Teams from the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) conducted monitoring missions to Tuz Khurmatu where they observed destroyed homes and businesses in several primarily Kurdish neighbourhoods of the ethnically and religiously mixed city in the wake of the transfer of security authority in the area in October.

Since the outbreak of violence in Tuz Khurmatu in October, UNAMI has received a number of allegations of human rights abuses and violations, in particular with regard to civilian casualties and two allegations of sexual violence. These incidents are still being investigated. UNAMI also received and investigated a large number of allegations concerning the destruction of property that took place on 16 and 17 October. A number of sources and witnesses alleged that civilians and members of Turkmen armed groups carried out these acts as well as intimidating residents, many of whom left the city in fear. The identity of the perpetrators of these acts remains unknown.

UNAMI received reports of these incidents from internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Tuz Khurmatu who are currently in Kirkuk, Sulaymanyia and Erbil, government and security forces, media reports and journalists, community and political representatives and national and international NGOs. Many IDPs attributed the violence to the tensions between the Kurdish and Shia-Turkmen communities. They alleged much of the destruction and looting occurred after the Kurdish inhabitants left the city, most of whom have not yet returned. Moreover, many alleged that while looting was apparently carried out widely and at random in their neighbourhoods, more serious damage was of a targeted nature - for example, on the basis of political or security affiliation.

As of 14 December, according to figures provided by the International Organization for Migration, 1,440 families (8,694 individuals) from Tuz Khurmatu are currently displaced following the events of mid-October. 444 displaced families (2,664 individuals) have returned to their homes. One IDP told UNAMI ""I am afraid for my family's security. We do not want to go back until this issue is resolved. The deployment of Iraqi Army commandos from outside Tuz Khurmatu to secure our neighbourhoods is a good thing because they are neutral."" Another IDP stated: ""We are afraid to go back because there is also shelling now into our neighbourhoods.""

Teams from UNAMI undertook two monitoring missions to Tuz Khurmatu on 7 and 14 December, primarily to assess allegations concerning property damage. They visited the neighbourhoods of Askari and Imam Ahmed, and subsequently Jumhori and Jamila. UNAMI observed during the first mission in the Askari and Imam Ahmed neighbourhoods, both of which have a large Turkmen population, one building damaged from what appeared to be a mortar strike. UNAMI also observed damage to the local Kurdish PUK party office and severe fire damage to an automobile business north of the city. During the mission, UNAMI also met representatives of the Tuz Khurmatu City Council, representing Sunni-Arab, Shia-Turkmen, and Kurdish communities. A representative from the Shia-Turkmen Popular Mobilisation Units (PMUs) was interviewed, as well as a senior police officer responsible for the area. The team sought to obtain independent accounts of what transpired, as well as accounts of security operations, and information about investigations being carried out.

Before the follow-on visit on 14 December, UNAMI received an analysis of satellite imagery of the primarily Kurdish quarters of Jumhori and Jamila prior to and after the violence. The imagery indicated that at least 29 buildings had been destroyed in Jumhori and 11 in Jamila. During the visit, the UNAMI team observed approximately 100 shops burnt or damaged along the main market road in Jumhori, many of which could not be observed in the satellite imagery. The team also observed approximately 30 homes that were burnt or damaged. Five houses were demolished in Jamila and one in Jumhori.

The team noted that it was difficult to spot looted buildings unless doors were open, and that many houses were inaccessible behind high walls or within compounds, making it impossible to determine whether there was damage or looting. The team cannot therefore exclude the possibility that the number of houses destroyed and/or looted could be higher; indeed, UNAMI has received allegations about a significantly higher number of houses affected.

The UNAMI team also observed widespread graffiti marking homes as belonging to Turkmen, allegedly to prevent damage and/or looting. IDPs reported they would ask Turkmen friends and/or neighbours to mark their properties to protect them.

UNAMI has consistently expressed concern about the situation of the civilian population in Tuz Khurmatu and allegations of the destruction of property, both in press statements on 19 October and 12 December and during the briefing by Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Mr. Ján Kubiš, to the UN Security Council on 22 November. UNAMI requests the Iraqi authorities to take all necessary measures to protect civilians in Tuz Khurmatu, not least in light of recent shelling attacks; to facilitate the safe, dignified and voluntary return of IDPs; and to hold accountable those responsible for the violations that occurred since mid-October. UNAMI also expresses its concern over the recent repeated indiscriminate mortar attacks which have inflicted losses, including civilian casualties from among the Turkmen community, in the town and calls for an immediate end to acts that threaten the security and the safety of the Kurdish and Turkmen communities.

**Highlights**

On 22 December, UNHCR evacuated 162 highly vulnerable refugees from Libya directly to Italy, with the strong support of the Italian government which facilitated their transport through an Italian military plane. The group was composed of refugees from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Yemen, who had been detained in Libya, and included unaccompanied children and women. An additional evacuation of 131 refugees from Libya to UNHCR’s Emergency Transit Mechanism in Niger is planned for 23 December, bringing the total number of refugees evacuated from Libya to 396 individuals. Last week,  
UNHCR launched an urgent appeal calling for 1,300 resettlement places to be made available by the end of March 2018 for vulnerable refugees stranded in Libya.

On 17 December, UNHCR international staff visited Gharyan detention centre, located in the Nafusa Mountains (90 km south of Tripoli) for the first time. UNHCR and its partner IMC are currently providing medical assistance in this centre on a daily basis. UNHCR transferred 150 vulnerable refugees from Gharyan to Triq Al Sikka detention centre to prepare for the forthcoming evacuations to Italy and Niger.

**UNHCR Response**

On 19 December, the UNHCR Representative visited the Fallah 1 IDP settlement in Tripoli, which currently hosts more than 250 displaced families from Tawergha. The UNHCR team met with community representatives to assess their most pressing needs. Among these are the lack of drinkable water, a precarious electrical system in the settlement, and the lack of food and basic commodities needed for the winter. In response, on 21 December, UNHCR and its partner LibAid coordinated the distribution of core relief items, including blankets and plastic sheets. In addition, UNHCR plans to implement quick impact projects in this settlement in order to improve the living conditions.

Last week, UNHCR delivered medical supplies to the Libyan national health system. This was the third contribution to the Ministry of Health by UNHCR in the last six months, and will support the treatment of persons in need of medical assistance in various part of Libya.

As of 21 December, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) rescued/intercepted a total of 15,238 refugees and migrants at sea, an increase of 6.3% compared to 2016 (14,332 individuals).

2391024,"UNAMI Training Ends with a Call to Strengthen the Capacities of Women to Participate Meaningfully in National Reconciliation and Historic Settlement Process [EN/AR] Baghdad, Iraq, 22 December 2017 – An advanced training to enhance the negotiation and mediation skills of local civil society groups and women leaders, organized by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and UN Women, concluded in Baghdad on 20 December with calls for increased participation of women and civil society groups in community reconciliation, national reconciliation and historic settlement. The training was a follow-up to the basic training and workshop delivered to the same participants in October 2016. The workshop aimed at training women leaders to be effective mediators and facilitators. It also focused on the important role women can play in peace building, negotiations and political processes. Similar training and workshops have been delivered to 60 women leaders, human rights defenders, members of provincial, district and sub districts councils in the Southern Governorates of Missan, Karbala, Najaf, Basra, Wasit and Babil.

Women leaders at the workshop emphasized their readiness to UNAMI/UNWOMEN to advocate for their full participation and to offer them opportunities to participate in negotiations and reconciliation alongside their male counterparts. They agreed to form networks within their communities to address post Daesh issues like trust building among affected communities, de-radicalization of violent extremism as well as reconciling communities. They urged the UN to support their efforts towards rebuilding broken communities in the aftermath of the conflict with Daesh. They also urged the UN to strengthen women’s participation in the negotiations and political arena which was limited for women.

Speaking at the closing session of the four-day training, Ms. Mmabatlharo Nono Dihemo, Gender Advisor for UNAMI stressed the importance of strengthening the capacities of women to participate meaningfully in national reconciliation and historic settlement. Ms. Dihemo said: “Limited progress has been made towards increasing women representation in negotiation and mediation processes in Iraq. One of the reasons attributed to this is the belief by some that women lack the confidence and capacity to participate in such processes aimed at shaping the future of the country”.

However, Iraqi women are resilient, and have shown that they are capable of leading and influencing the political arena. Ms Dihemo said that “despite the explicit goal to promote women’s participation, as envisaged in the Iraq National Action Plan (INAP), women’s direct political participation in national reconciliation has continued to remain low and this needs to be recognized and addressed”.

She mentioned that she met with political leaders in Baghdad, Erbil and Suleymania and discussed ways to strengthen the participation of women in decision making and political processes. Ms Dihemo assured that UNAMI and UNWOMEN will work with all stakeholders to ensure the establishment of measures and legal frameworks that guarantee the participation of women in all three arms of the government, particularly the judiciary where women are underrepresented; and in national and community reconciliation processes; cabinet and government institutions.

The deadly event also injured four other children aged 8, 9, 10 and 11 years who remain in Lashio Township hospital.

“At this tragic moment, our thoughts go to the families. We must do everything to reduce exposure to landmines and explosive remnants of war, and provide the necessary long-term support services to survivors” urged June Kunugi, UNICEF Representative to Myanmar

In at least nine States and Regions of Myanmar, landmines and Explosive Remnant of War (ERW) are left behind from armed conflict or placed intentionally, continuing to cause harm to vulnerable populations, especially children and women.

In 2017, at least eight children have lost their lives and more than 37 have been severely injured from landmines and ERW. Over the past two years, there has been a new victim of landmines, on average, every three days. One out of every three victims is a child.

UNICEF calls on all parties to immediately stop laying new landmines and the Myanmar Government to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty. Addressing the scourge of landmines must also take centre stage in the peace process and national strategies promoting sustainable development.

UNICEF in Myanmar 

UNICEF has been working with the Government and the people of Myanmar since 1950. In partnership with the Government and the civil society, UNICEF’s current focus of work aims at reducing child mortality, improving access and quality of education and protecting children from violence, abuse and exploitation.

**A. Situation analysis** 

**Description of the disaster** 

Over the past 15 years, nearly fifty per cent of the total aid that all 49 Sub-Saharan Red Cross and Red Crescent’s National Societies have requested was targeted at off-setting famine and food insecurity (nearly 500 million Swiss francs out of 1 billion Swiss francs). Since the end of 2016, the African continent is facing an unprecedented rise of people classified as food insecure. Millions of people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sahel are facing a severe food crisis and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In many parts of the region, drought has further exacerbated vulnerabilities to disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihoods and displacement. Currently, there are 2.5 million people displaced by drought and conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. At no other time in recent history has severe hunger and starvation loomed so large. 

**Food Crisis in Africa - General overview** 

**Increasing food insecurity across Africa** 

In the recent years, there has been a rise in the frequency and severity of food crises in Africa. The causes to food insecurity are multiple and tend to overlap and lead to the development of complex and multi-sectoral crises. Conflicts, climatic stresses and shocks, economic shocks, spread of pests and disease, among others affect the different pillars of food security. 

Globally, an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries, mainly in Africa, are likely to require emergency food assistance in 2018. This figure is 60 percent higher than it was in 2015 and only slightly lower than the 83 million people in need during 2017. While the food security situation has improved in parts of Southern Africa due to increased agricultural outputs in 2017, this situation overshadows the impact of fall army worm on crop production. If it is considered that worst case scenario was avoided in the countries that were potentially on the brink of famine in 2017, great uncertainty remains surrounding the trends for 2018 and the Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates that the number of food insecure people having reached IPC level 3 and above has never been that high. 

Conlicts remain an important driver related to increased emergency food needs during 2018 including in the Central African Republic, Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, and South Sudan. The impact will be manifested by the disruption of food systems, malnutrition and adverse effect to the livelihoods of millions of people; limitation to trade and market functioning, displacement of households, and hinderance to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In Africa limited humanitarian access is, more than in any other part of the world, a major barrier in reaching populations in need ([see map](https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/key-documents/files/acaps_humanitarian_access_overview_world_humanitarian_day_2017.pdf)). In 2017, these conditions have led several countries to be on the brink of famine.",267,"English"

**The disaster and the Red Cross Red Crescent response to date**  

- 2016/2017: The African continent faces an unprecedented food crisis. Below-average rainfall due to El Nino and La Nina leads to poor crop harvests and limited availability of water. Conflict and violence further reduces the coping capacities of affected populations.  

- February 2017: The United Nations formally declares famine in parts of South Sudan, and reports severe food insecurity in Nigeria and Somalia.  

- April 2017: IFRC launches the Emergency Appeal for Regional Coordination of the Food Crisis in Africa to scale up and support actions in the most affected countries.  

- December 2017: IFRC issues this revised regional Emergency Appeal with an updated strategy, based on a continuous analysis of the evolving emergency and humanitarian needs in the African continent.  

**Summary:**   

This Emergency Appeal has been revised from CHF 3,877,335 to CHF 2,010,476 considering the adjusted geographic scope and evolving humanitarian needs in Africa, as well as the human resource requirements of the regional coordination team. A funding gap of CHF 857,045 remains in this revised Emergency Appeal. The strategy has been informed by a continuous analysis of the emergency and operational conditions in the countries with food crises in Africa, and may be further adjusted based on the developments in 2018.

2390754,"Australia must secure solutions for refugees abandoned on Manus Island **This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Cécile Pouilly – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.**  

In light of the continued perilous situation on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island for refugees and asylum seekers abandoned by Australia, UNHCR has called again this week on the Australian government live up to its responsibilities and urgently find humane and appropriate solutions.  

Since the closure of Australia’s “offshore processing” facility on 31 October, approximately 800 refugees and asylum seekers have remained in a precarious situation. Some 700 are now accommodated in the three sites: East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre, West Lorengau Haus and Hillside Haus. Over the past four weeks, at least five security incidents have been reported by refugees and asylum seekers, security personnel, local police, and members of the local community.  

The most serious incident occurred on the night of 10 December when three people armed with machetes and an axe attempted to force their way into West Lorengau Haus, where 150 refugees and asylum seekers were being accommodated.  They were ultimately stopped from causing serious harm by security staff. The same group then walked to nearby Hillside Haus where two of them, armed with a baton and a knife, entered unimpeded by security staff, and yelled that refugees and asylum seekers should leave. Police on Manus Island are looking into these incidents.  

The forced removal of refugees and asylum seekers on 22 November from the now decommissioned Australian facility has inflicted further trauma on people who have already suffered greatly - violence and persecution in their own country followed by four years in detention on Manus Island.  

The cessation of critical services including the support for victims of torture and trauma has only added to the harshness. Such support is vital for those with acute needs.  

A recent medical report commissioned by UNHCR also showed that the cumulative effect of uncertainty about the future, the lack of prospects for solutions, cessation of services, substandard living and hygiene conditions, and inadequate medical care poses a growing risk of deteriorating physical and mental health, violence, and self-harm among refugees and asylum seekers on Manus. The report also noted the obvious strain that is being placed on the host community and local resources, especially on the health system and hospital.  

UNHCR reiterated its call this week on the Australian authorities to secure long term solutions for all refugees and asylum seekers whom Australia has forcibly transferred to Papua New Guinea and Nauru, and to permanently settle those refugees who have already been transferred to Australia on medical or other grounds.

2390729,"Suspected cholera cases in Yemen surpass one million, reports UN health agency 22 December 2017 – The total number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has crossed one million, the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) reported today, urging greater efforts to tackle the outbreak and deal with the deteriorating health situation in the war-torn nation.

“The epidemic is not yet over and more concerted efforts need to be deployed to ensure that it is controlled in the immediate term and prevented from reoccurring in the near future,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarevic told a press briefing in Geneva.

Responding to the deadly outbreak in late April, WHO set up treatment centres, provided supplies, trained health workers, and worked with local communities on ways to prevent the disease.

These efforts resulted in tens of thousands of lives being saved.

According to WHO, 99.7 per cent of the people who became sick with suspected cholera and who could access health services survived.

The UN agency continues to support dehydration treatment centres across the country as well as collect stool samples for lab testing, transport them to labs, meet operational costs and make available supplies and reagents.

It also continues surveillance, detection and treatment work.  

**One outbreak after another**  

With its health and sanitation systems in near ruin, Yemen is also now experiencing a rapidly spreading diphtheria outbreak, which has affected 18 of its 22 governorates. About 333 clinically diagnosed cases (mostly in Ibb and Hodeida governorates) have been confirmed.

Diphtheria – a highly-infectious disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria that infects the throat and upper airways, and produces a toxin affecting other organs – can be prevented with vaccines and treated with antitoxins and antibiotics.

But lack of medicines in the country mean the number of cases could rise.

**UN response amid ongoing challenges** 

Responding to this latest outbreak, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) [airlifted](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=58329) some 6 million doses of essential vaccines for children, include inoculations for diphtheria.

WHO has also delivered antibiotics and 1,000 vials of life-saving diphtheria antitoxins to affected governorates.

Similarly, the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) has also upped its response, providing more than 20,000 medical consultations to internally displaced people and other conflict-affected Yemenis via 22 mobile health teams and two permanent health facilities.  

But the fact that the outbreak is occurring amid a complex emergency setting with violent clashes and restrictions of transport of supplies, including medical supplies, means response efforts are extremely difficult.

Underscoring the need for unhindered and sustained access to all areas of Yemen to save lives, the WHO spokesperson asked the Yemeni authorities and all parties to the conflict to facilitate the importation and distribution of medicines and medical supplies, as well as clearances for health partners to reach and treat affected communities.

“If [we] cannot bring in medicines and medical supplies, we cannot save lives,” he stressed.",267,"English"

2390669,"Central America Hashes Out Agenda for Sustainable Use of Water By [Edgardo Ayala](http://www.ipsnews.net/author/edgardo-ayala/)

SAN SALVADOR, Dec 21 2017 (IPS) - The countries of Central America are striving to define a plan to promote the sustainable use of water, a crucial need in a region that is already suffering the impacts of climate change.

This effort has materialised in Central America’s Water Agenda, the draft of which was agreed in November, in Tegucigalpa, by the governments of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, along with the Spanish-speaking Caribbean nation the Dominican Republic.

These countries form part of the Central American Integration System (SICA), the economic and political organisation of Central American countries, since December 1991, where they are working to address the issue of water with a regional and sustainable perspective.

The document is expected to be approved at a regional meeting to be held in February in Santo Domingo, according to Central American officials and experts interviewed by IPS.

“We saw that it was convenient for us to work on a plan, a sort of agenda, that would give expression to the issue of the integral management of the resource,” Salvador Nieto, executive director of the Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD), told IPS.

This is the SICA agency made up of the environment ministers of the eight countries, focused on coordinating efforts to collectively preserve the region’s ecosystems.

And water is a vitally important issue for the 50.6 million Central Americans, especially farmers who have lost their crops due to a lack or excess of rainfall, as a result of climate change.

“All the studies recognise the vulnerability of the region, and point out that the most severe impacts of climate change for Central America will be because of the water issue,” Nieto added.

He said that although reports show that there will be intense storms, they also warn that in the medium term the main problem will be a shortage of water throughout the region.

In 2014, drought caused some 650 million dollars in losses in agriculture, hydroelectric power generation and drinking water, according to the study Situation of Water Resources in Central America: Towards Integrated Management, published in March by the Global Water Partnership (GWP).

However, the region has good water availability, because Central American countries use less than 10 percent of their available resources, points out the August edition of Entre-aguas, a report by the regional office of the GWP, an international network of organisations involved in the question of the management of water resources.

The problem, the report says, is the irregular temporal and geographical distribution of precipitation, and the scarce mechanisms of water storage and regulation.

That limits an optimal and efficient use of water, which leads to basins with problems of water scarcity in the dry season.

The GWP report adds that, due to the high climate variability associated with climate change, the concentration of rainfall in certain regions or in certain periods and droughts in others, affects the quantity and quality of water available.

In 2014, 17 percent of Central America’s total population, some 7.8 million people, did not have drinking water in their homes, according to the World Bank.

In this sense, the Agenda seeks to ensure water availability for present and future generations, but also to establish actions to face extreme climate events.

This situation in Central America, a region constantly affected by climate phenomena, convinced the political elites to take action not only in their countries, but at a regional level.

The GWP has been working with the CCAD to promote the strengthening of governance of water resources in Central America.

“In the region there has been no political instrument to establish a common agenda on water issues, which is why this effort has been made: to generate a space for coordination among the environment ministers, who are responsible for the management of water,” Tábora said, from the GWP regional office in Tegucigalpa.

The Agenda emerges from the effort to establish integrated management of water resources, one of the objectives contained in the CCAD Regional Environmental Framework Strategy, approved in February 2015 by the environment ministers of the region.

This integrated management, from which the Agenda arises, contemplates addressing key areas, such as the promotion of governance systems for the sustainable use of water, which involves actions, for example, to generate and share data and experiences regarding the problems involving water.

“The development of knowledge about water resources is through research, monitoring, or establishing measuring stations and sharing information, a recurrent need in all the countries of Central America,” José Miguel Zeledón, water director in Costa Rica’s Environment and Energy Ministry, told IPS.

He stressed that “we have to make progress in assessing the water situation, because our countries lack information, in order to know what water resources we have, what state they are in and how we can distribute them.”

Another strategic area is the development of instruments for the integrated management of international water bodies, which involves the promotion of a political dialogue at the highest level on protocols, agreements or successful model agreements on the subject.

“The implementation of the Agenda would bring benefits because many communities with water problems are in shared or transboundary basins, and that is why a main focus is to work on the question of international water bodies,” Silvia Larios, an expert on water in El Salvador’s Environment Ministry, told IPS.

Of the river basins in Central America, 23 are transboundary, covering approximately 191,449 square km (37 percent of the Central American territory), and the region has 18 transboundary aquifer systems, according to the GWP.

The GWP also emphasises the importance of promoting technology exchange, as there are communities that cannot be supplied with traditional systems, or cannot properly manage their wastewater, but will have to look for other technical options.

Larios stressed that the Agenda seeks both to reduce conflicts over the use of water resources and to guarantee availability. She also recognises access to water as a human right, to guarantee the supply to communities.

The GWP’s Tábora said that Central America has made progress in water coverage and infrastructure development, but that there is still a gap between rural and urban areas.

“Rural areas continue to be but on the back burner,” she said. Of Central America’s total population, 58 percent lives in urban areas, according to the GWP study.

Also, added Tábora, water quality has been neglected, both in cities and in rural areas.

Addressing the challenges related to water, she said, necessitates an understanding that solutions have inherent political actions, such as the enactment of water laws, given that the resource is linked to economic interests.

To set the Agenda into motion, its operational plan has yet to be implemented, alliances have to be built with various organisations and its funding must be organised and managed by the regional cooperation mechanisms.",267,"English"
2390659,"Secretary General, at Joint Event in The Hague, Stresses Need for Harder Work to Prevent Crises amid Growing Instability, Volatility SG/SM/18836  

22 DECEMBER 2017

Following are UN Secretary‑General António Guterres’ remarks at a joint event with Cabinet Ministers, academia and civil society of the Netherlands, “Security Central: The United Nations and Current Threats to International Peace and Security”, in The Hague today:

I am delighted to be visiting the Netherlands because it is always a pleasure to visit a country whose Government and people are such strong supporters of the United Nations and so clearly committed to multilateralism in the difficult times that multilateralism is facing in the present world.

The Hague is one of the world’s great centres of international life, including through hosting the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and several other organizations. And I would like to thank you again for your role in enabling the Tribunal to register many landmark achievements in justice, accountability and our fight against impunity for grave crimes.

This visit takes place just days before the Netherlands takes on important responsibilities as a member of the Security Council for 2018 — your first such term on the Council since 1999‑2000. So, I welcome the opportunity to review some of the challenges we face, counting on your very strong commitment to the work of the United Nations.

I know that the Netherlands wants to be effective as a partner in protecting people and maintaining international peace and security. You are also already a generous provider of humanitarian assistance, and an active participant in United Nations peacekeeping operations, with more than 300 troops and other personnel currently stationed in Mali, Liberia, South Sudan and the Middle East.

And you are a strong believer in gender equality and the empowerment of women and young people. And gender parity is today a central objective of the United Nations, being fully aware that we will never reach gender equality if we don’t make a strong bet on women’s empowerment. And parity in international organizations is a key tool for women’s empowerment. And you are deeply engaged in development cooperation, including as a key voice in shaping the landmark 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

I welcome the Dutch SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] Charter, by which the Netherlands is mobilizing a network of cooperation in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. Partnerships among the public sector, private business and civil society will be crucial in achieving the Goals and keeping the Agenda’s core promise to leave no one behind. For these reasons and more, you are well placed to help strengthen peace operations, address the diverse drivers of conflict and serve as a bridge between countries and people in a moment in which we have a serious deficit of trust — trust between people and political establishments and international organizations, and trust amongst States, namely within the Security Council.

With tensions over nuclear weapons as high as they have been since the end of the cold war, the Netherlands will play a key role as Chair of the Sanctions Committee on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and through involvement in implementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran.

You will also work with your Council colleagues on a worrying number of pressing, complex and dangerous threats to international peace and security. They include:  

* questions of accountability and justice related to the use of chemical weapons in Syria;  

* the crisis in northern Mali and the challenges of mounting a G‑5 Sahel force in the region;  

* the risk of widespread famine in Yemen and the critical importance of ensuring humanitarian access to those in need;  

* and ensuring that the unique needs and roles of women and children affected by conflict are taken into account.  

We are all aware that this is a moment of profound uncertainty and risk unparalleled in the post‑cold war period. Beyond the nuclear question, other threats to international peace and security are evolving rapidly and are increasingly transnational and interlinked. Climate change is moving faster than we are. Water scarcity is a growing concern. And his Majesty the King has played a very important role in relation to mobilizing the international community on addressing the water problems.

Inequality is rising. Cybersecurity dangers are escalating, as some of the same advances in technology that have generated so many gains have also made it easier for extremists to communicate, broadcast distorted narratives of grievance, recruit followers and exploit people. The misuse of digital surveillance poses serious challenges to the free exercise of democratic rights and processes.

Civil wars almost tripled in the decade between 2005 and 2015, including a sixfold increase in fatalities between 2011 and 2015. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of armed conflict, resulting in massive humanitarian needs. Today’s conflicts are increasingly exacerbated by transnational factors such as drug smuggling and human trafficking, and provide a source of income for armed groups.

And we have also seen a rise in the internationalization and regionalization of conflicts, as in Syria, Libya and Yemen. When one looks today at the Middle East, we see a global Middle East crisis. It’s no longer only the Israel‑Palestinian question or the Syrian crisis or the Iraq crisis or the… all these things are interlinked. Both sides of the gulf in a very complex situation of conflict and a widespread threat moving from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, and in ways that are totally unpredictable in relation to the near future. We don’t know where the next crisis will emerge, how serious it will be and how we will be able to face it.

Europe itself is home to a number of unresolved protracted conflicts, and faces threats — such as violent extremism and human trafficking — linked to conflict dynamics beyond its borders. These developments are taking place within a polarized international community. Divisions in the Security Council and divergences with or within regional organizations constrain efforts at unified action. And we are also seeing a rise in nationalist, xenophobic and populist agendas, namely in the West. The integration of newcomers to the region remains a considerable challenge.

Like the United Nations, European institutions are facing a drop in trust and have struggled to create political consensus and adapt their collective security tools. So, we have our work cut out for us. It is clear to me that in face of greater instability and volatility, we must work harder to prevent the crises that take such a high toll on humanity, undermine institutions, and reverse development progress.

We must tackle the immediate grievances and root causes of conflict that divide societies and cause States and citizens to use violence and repression as a means of achieving their goals and resolving their differences. A prevention agenda may seem an ambitious project in a moment of global polarization and political flux. But fortunately, with the 2030 Agenda, we have a clear, credible and common road map in relation to development and many aspects that we can centre around development. Because the framework includes Goal 16, dedicated to “peace, justice and strong institutions”, governance is a central question in our concerns.

For my part, upon taking office I initiated a wide‑ranging reform process to streamline United Nations management, align the United Nations development system with the 2030 Agenda, and strengthen the United Nations peace and security architecture. The latter involves a strong focus on early warning and early action to avoid crises, and peacebuilding in order to sustain peace. And I have also established a High-level Advisory Board on Mediation as part of a broader and necessary surge in diplomacy for peace. And this is particularly worrying when the, I would say, most relevant brand of the United Nations — that are the “Blue Helmets” — the peacekeeping missions face such a challenging environment in many contexts where there is simply no peace to keep.

The question of the future of peace operations will now be submitted to a strategic review in which we hope the Netherlands will play a very important role. And we are extremely grateful for your continued commitment to peacekeeping, even in the very difficult situations where peacekeeping takes place. The presence of the Netherlands forces in Kidal [Mali] is the demonstration of that fact. This is something that must be at the centre of our discussions in the Security Council during the next year, and we count a lot on the Netherlands to help us do the necessary strategic reviews and reforms.

The magnitude and complexity of global challenges are too immense for any country or organization to tackle alone. We need to do more to devise joint strategies and to draw on our comparative advantages. The United Nations is strongly committed to deepening our partnership with key regional partners like the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. At the same time, and in relation to peace operations, our cooperation with the African Union is a key strategic objective that we are already fully implementing in the context of the enhanced platform of cooperation between the two organizations.

Together, we must spread a common message of tolerance and present an alternative vision to the xenophobic agendas that fuel conflict and the animosity in the region and around the world. Prevention is urgent. And I look forward to hearing your thoughts on how, together, we can spread the message and the practice of peace. I wish the Netherlands every success during the important year ahead, including during your Presidency of the Security Council in March. I believe this will be a very important moment for us to move ahead in some of the most difficult dossiers that we have been trying to tackle in the recent past.

The mandate of the Special Tribunal, which is based near The Hague in the Netherlands, is to hold trials for those accused of carrying out the attack of 14 February 2005 in Beirut, which killed 22 people, including the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, and injured many others. The trial, in absentia, of four individuals indicted over the killing began in January 2014 and is currently ongoing.

The Special Tribunal for Lebanon also has jurisdiction over attacks carried out in Lebanon between 1 October 2004 and 12 December 2005, if they are connected to the attack of 14 February 2005 and are of a similar nature and gravity.

The Secretary‑General reaffirms the commitment of the United Nations to support the work of the Special Tribunal in the fight against impunity for such major crimes, in order to bring those responsible to justice. The United Nations looks forward to the completion of the mandate of the Special Tribunal in a timely manner. The United Nations also looks forward to the continued support and cooperation of the Government of Lebanon.

2390649,"The European Union donates an additional EUR 10.5 million to UNRWA at a crucial time for Palestine refugees The European Union (EU) has announced an additional, vital contribution of EUR 10.5 million to the 2017 Programme Budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), in support of education, access to health care, employment opportunities, and improved living conditions for millions of Palestine refugees.

This donation complements nearly five decades of steadfast EU support of Palestine refugees. This year, in particular, the European Union and UNRWA have launched the unique _Healthy Living, Healthy Spaces_ (HLHS) campaign, targeting 50 EU-sponsored UNRWA schools and 15 health centers for repair and rehabilitation across Lebanon, Gaza, West Bank and Jordan fields. Both [the HLHS initiative](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-and-eu-celebrate-launch-project-improve-unrwa-health-and-educational) and latest contribution stand as a testament to the strong EU and UNRWA partnership for Palestine refugees.

In recognition of the contribution, Pierre Krähenbühl, UNRWA Commissioner-General, stated: “Giving some half million students in UNRWA schools across the Middle East a sense of dignity and preserving their opportunities is particularly urgent at a time when the spaces in which they can develop and enjoy a normal childhood are shrinking so dramatically. This is particularly important in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in Gaza and in Syria. In these contexts, the support we receive from the EU is of critical significance.”

""With this contribution, the EU support to the regular UNRWA budget in 2017 has reached EUR 102 million. This support allows millions of Palestine refugees to receive access to education, health and other social services. These services are crucial for sustaining hope amid a tough reality,"" said EU Representative Ralph Tarraf. ""In its five fields of operations, UNRWA is contributing to stability in the face of enormous new challenges. The EU will continue to support this effort until a just and agreed-upon solution is found for Palestine refugees. This is an essential element of the EU strategy to maintain peace in the region,"" he added. 

The European Union is the Agency’s largest multi-lateral donor, with an overall yearly contribution amounting to 12.5 per cent of the total programme support. This latest donation brings the EU contributions to EUR 102 million for 2017, including EUR 82 million disbursed earlier in the year and the additional contribution of EUR 9.5 million announced this past September.

**EU AND UNRWA: TOGETHER FOR PALESTINE REFUGEES**

Since 1971, the European Union and UNRWA have maintained a strategic partnership governed by the shared objective to support the human development, humanitarian and protection needs of Palestine refugees and promote stability in the Middle East. Today, the European Union is the largest multilateral provider of international assistance to Palestine refugees. This reliable and predictable support from the European Union enables UNRWA to provide core services to more than 5 million Palestine refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, including quality education for roughly half a million children and primary health care for more than 3.5 million patients.

Collectively, the EU and its Member States are also among the largest contributors to the Agency’s humanitarian emergency appeals and projects in response to various crises and specific needs across the region. The partnership between the European Union and UNRWA has allowed millions of Palestine refugees to be better educated, live healthier lives, access employment opportunities and improve their living conditions, thus contributing to the development of the entire region.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. As a result, the UNRWA Programme Budget, which supports the delivery of core essential services, operates with a large shortfall. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

UNRWA is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees. Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight. UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection and microfinance.

2390619,"Temporary Protected Status for El Salvador: Findings of a Refugees International Research Mission **TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR EL SALVADOR**

In early 2018, the Trump Administration will decide the fate of some 200,000 Salvadorans who are living in the United States. By January 8, the Secretary of Homeland Security must decide whether or not to extend the designation of El Salvador as a Temporary Protected Status (TPS)-designated country. Should the Secretary decide not to extend TPS, some 200,000 Salvadorans will be subject to deportation.

Most of the Salvadorans facing possible deportation are parents to U.S.-born children and have known no home other than the United States for almost two decades. The TPS statute clearly provides the Trump Administration with the legal authority to extend TPS for 18 months in this particular circumstance, and humanitarian, human rights and ethical imperatives – as well as the promotion of peace and stability in El Salvador – demand that TPS be renewed and that Salvadoran beneficiaries and their families not be forced to return.   

This policy brief outlines the findings from a field mission to Central America, undertaken by Refugees International in November 2017. The report provides a fact-based and realistic assessment of the significant implications if TPS designation for El Salvador is not renewed. 

**Summary** 

In the next few weeks, the Trump Administration will decide the fate of some 200,000 Salvadorans who are living in the United States. By January 8, 2018, the Secretary of Homeland Security must decide whether or not to approve an extension of El Salvador as a Temporary Protected Status (TPS)-designated country. Should the Secretary decide not to extend TPS, some 200,000 Salvadorans will be subject to deportation. Most of the Salvadorans facing possible deportation are parents to U.S.-born children and have known no home other than the United States for almost two decades. The TPS statute clearly provides the Trump Administration with the legal authority to extend TPS for 18 months in this particular circumstance. Based on the findings of a November 2017 Refugees International mission, RI concludes that humanitarian, human rights and ethical imperatives — as well as the promotion of peace and stability in El Salvador — demand that TPS be renewed and that Salvadoran beneficiaries and their families not be forced to return.  

**Background**

The Temporary Protected Status legislation enables the U.S. government to protect eligible foreign nationals in the United States from being returned to their countries of citizenship when those countries experience: 1) armed conflict that prevents safe return; 2) an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic or other environmental disaster rendering the foreign state unable to handle adequately return of its nationals; or 3) other extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent safe return. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to designate a foreign country with TPS for six to 18 months and, when that period ends, is further empowered to extend TPS for six, twelve or eighteen months if the Secretary determines “the conditions for such designation…continue to be met.”

El Salvador was designated with TPS on March 9, 2001, after two devastating earthquakes earlier that year which led to the deaths of more than one thousand people, affected 1.5 million Salvadorans, and caused an estimated US$1.66 billion in damages.2 El Salvador’s TPS status has been extended continually by subsequent U.S. administrations, beginning with the administration of George W. Bush. The most recent extension was conferred in 2016, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) noting that “conditions in El Salvador supporting the TPS designation continue to be met.”3 As USCIS indicated in its statement less than two years ago, living conditions in El Salvador continued to be substantially impacted as a result of the earthquakes. That remains the case today, while other socio-economic, political and security challenges in El Salvador have only made it more difficult to address pervasive impacts of the earthquakes.  

This circumstance provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with ample authority to renew TPS for 18 months. The question is whether, for humanitarian, human rights and ethical reasons — as well as to promote peace and stability in El Salvador — the Secretary should use her authority to do so. 
 
Refugees International (RI) recently concluded a mission to Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador, where it researched the mounting protection and humanitarian challenges migrants, asylum-seekers, and deportees face. Based on its findings, RI is convinced that El Salvador is not in a position to absorb the return of its nationals safely and in a manner that addresses basic needs, and that such return will have serious and substantial negative human rights and humanitarian implications. This is due primarily to the ongoing violence in El Salvador and the unwillingness or inability of the Salvadoran government to provide adequate reception conditions for returnees.",267,"English"
2390609,"Tragedy spurs Cattle Keeper's Passion for Peace at Migration Conference in South Sudan **KHALIF FARAH**

Bashir Hamid is a cattle keeper from Misseriya, a nomadic community living in the border zone between Sudan and South Sudan.

In the dry season, the 56-year-old and his people migrate across the border into Dinka territory of South Sudan to graze and water their cattle. Historically, this has caused significant tension and, at times, violent clashes between the two communities.

Since 1991, Bashir Hamid has been involved with various initiatives to keep the peace between the groups.

Despite the loss of five sons aged between 18-27 years in fighting at the border early this year, his personal commitment to peace remains steadfast.

“As painful as the loss of my sons is, and despite the strong urge for revenge, I and my community remain committed to maintaining peace with our Dinka neighbours,” he said.

This year, Bashir Hamid attended the Misseriya-Dinka pre-migration conference in Wanyjok, Aweil East State, to contribute to peace-building efforts. The two-day conference was supported by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan’s Civil Affairs Section, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Saferworld, an independent international organization dedicated to improving security, peace and development.

More than 125 representatives from both communities gathered for the annual conference and  signed a  number of resolutions affecting pastoral migration and trade including security of cattle keepers, blood compensations, cattle theft, rape, adultery, farm destruction  and bush burning . The delegates also recommended removal of the multiple taxations, immigration fees and other barriers to improve cross border trade.

For Misseriya, Bashir Hamid says, living with Dinka in peace is not an option but a necessity.

“To get grazing and pasture for our cattle, which are our economic mainstay, during the dry season in South Sudan, we must maintain good neighborliness, relationship and cooperation with Dinka.”

He says the two communities are bound by common destiny, not only by geography, migration and trade. His vision for the future is a relationship transformed into one of cooperation between the two countries of Sudan and South Sudan, with free movement of people and good across the border.

Bashir Hamid is proud that his generation have made peace with Dinka possible. He hopes that the next generation will nurture that relationship and continue the legacy of peace into the future.",267,"English"
2390604,"Mexico: Address Chiapas Displacement Crisis **Investigate Armed Attacks; Assist Displaced People**

(Washington, D.C.)—[Mexican](https://www.hrw.org/americas/mexico) authorities should investigate armed attacks in Chiapas that have led to the displacement of more than 5,000 people and provide assistance to those in need, Human Rights Watch said today.

In October, a territorial conflict about communal lands between the municipalities of Chalchihuitán and Chenalhó escalated. A spokesperson for the municipality of Chalchihuitán, Nicodemo Aguilar Sánchez, told Human Rights Watch that on October 18, 2017, members of an armed group killed a man from Chalchihuitán, Samuel Luna Girón. In the following two weeks, he said, armed groups burned at least 12 houses and fired at eight others, which led to more than 5,000 people fleeing their homes.

“The Mexican government urgently needs to attend to the displacement crisis in Chiapas so that people can safely return to their communities as soon as possible,” said [José Miguel Vivanco](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/jose-miguel-vivanco), Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should investigate and punish those responsible for any abuses, and ensure that the people who were forced to flee their homes receive the assistance they need.”

Officials from two nongovernmental groups who recently visited the area and the Catholic priest from a nearby parish told Human Rights Watch that the continued presence of armed groups is preventing the residents from returning. [A medical mission from two other local aid organizations, Salud y Desarrollo Comunitario and Ixim Antsetic, found that,](https://frayba.org.mx/informe-de-brigada-medica-en-chalchihuitan) in addition to the man allegedly killed by members of an armed group, at least six other people have died of illnesses or other causes related to the displacement, such as pneumonia and hypothermia.

2390599,"Southeastern Iran Hit By Another Moderate Earthquake; 23 Reported Injured An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 rocked Iran's southeastern province of Kerman on December 21 and at least 23 people were injured, state TV said, only a day after two people were killed by a similar tremor near Tehran.

Rescue teams were dispatched to the town of Kuhbanan, the epicenter of the latest quake, officials said. No deaths were reported.

""Electricity has been cut off in the town.... Some houses were damaged,"" a local official told state TV.

The semiofficial ILNA news agency said many residents rushed out of houses in Kuhbanan, fearing more tremors after several aftershocks followed the quake, which hit three hours before midnight local time.

""I am urging people to remain calm. The weather is so cold and we need tents.... Still, we don't have a clear idea about possible fatalities and the exact number of wounded people,"" Kuhbanan's police chief Mohsen Seifouri told the semiofficial Fars news agency.

Another local official said there were no casualties.

""Several rescue teams are in the quake-hit area and fortunately we had no casualties,"" the deputy head of Kerman Province's crisis management headquarters, Mostafa Ayatollahi-Mousavi, told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.

Several strong quakes hit Kerman Province on December 12, leaving dozens of people injured and damaging houses.

On December 20, a quake of magnitude 5.2 struck a town near Tehran, killing an elderly woman and a young girl and injuring nearly 120 people.

Iran is crisscrossed by several major geological fault lines and is one of the world's most quake-prone countries. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 quake in Kerman Province killed 31,000 people and flattened the ancient city of Bam.",267,"English"
2390594,"South Africa: Empowering women at JRS Arrupe Centres Johannesburg, 22 December 2017 – In South Africa, host to one of the largest populations of urban refugees in the world, the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) runs two centres for women refugees and asylum seekers. The centres, in Pretoria and Johannesburg, are named of JRS’s founder, Fr Pedro Arrupe SJ, and run projects that empower women with applicable vocational skills.

The life skills training courses offered at the Arrupe Centres range from English language to baking.  Once students complete their courses, they are given start-up kits and the opportunity to attend a business training seminar, where they learn how to use their newly acquired skills to generate income for themselves and their families.

As part of the final project before graduation, tailoring students in Pretoria must complete entire outfits.

Teaching beneficiaries how to work with fondant icing has been an important addition to the baking courses, as this particular technique enables many women to secure jobs as birthday and wedding cake bakers after graduation. 

Of all the courses, the cosmetology and hairdressing classes have proved to be especially successful in helping women gain generate income. 

“In order for these refugee women to successfully rebuild their lives in the urban settings of South Africa, skills training…and in some cases retraining in skills that are relevant, is key to their healthy integration.” says Jill Drzewiecki, JRS International’s Campaign and Philanthropy Officer. 

The opportunity to learn relevant and applicable skills is essential for female refugees living in protracted situations of displacement, especially in urban contexts; the JRS Arrupe Centres are proud to contribute to empowering women to be changemakers in their families and communities through financial security.",267,"English"

2390579,"Diphtheria – Yemen: Disease outbreak news, 22 December 2017 On 29 October 2017, the WHO team in Sana’a, Yemen received reports of suspected cases of Diphtheria from Ibb governorate. From 13 August through 21 December 2017, a total of 333 suspected cases including 35 deaths (case fatality ratio = 10.5%) have been reported from 20 governorates. In the absence of laboratory-confirmation, the current situation is being treated as an outbreak of suspected diphtheria based on clinical diagnosis.

The majority of cases have been reported from Ibb Governorate (187 suspected cases). Seventy-nine percent of cases are less than 20 years old while 19% are children under 5 years old. There has been a similar number of male and female suspected cases (three suspected cases had no information about their sex). Sixty-one percent of the suspected cases have never received any vaccination against diphtheria.

As of 21 December 2017, there were 35 deaths among suspected diphtheria cases. Fourteen of the deaths occurred in children under five years old.

**[Figure 1](http://www.who.int/csr/don/22-december-2017-diphtheria-yemen/en/): Number of suspected diphtheria cases and deaths by week of illness onset from 13 August through 21 December 2017**

Note: Date of onset is missing for 31 cases and 10 deaths and so are not included in this figure

Source: Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP)

**Public health response**

The response has focused on providing guidance and support for the clinical management of cases and contacts, establishing referral pathways and isolation units, supporting laboratory confirmation of suspected cases, providing medicines and medical supplies, vaccinating children and young adults in high-risk areas, and engaging with communities on all aspects of the outbreak, including the treatment and prevention of diphtheria cases.

***Coordination and operations support***

- A Diphtheria Task Force has been activated to respond to the outbreak, comprising of the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP), WHO and UNICEF. The Task Force has assumed the leadership of the joint efforts to control this outbreak and focus on providing technical support to the affected districts.

- An Emergency Operating Center (EOC) has now been activated to provide an implementation platform for the response to diphtheria.

***Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing***

- WHO is supporting the training, equipment and deployment of teams in the most affected districts for active case detection and referral, identifying contacts and providing them antibiotics.

- WHO is working with the local authorities and partners to strengthen laboratory testing capacity, and for the collection of samples. As soon as MoPHP approvals are granted, samples will be transported to a WHO Collaborating Centre outside Yemen for confirmation.

- WHO is providing laboratory reagents to facilitate testing in-country.

***Case management***

- Clinical management is being led by the MoPHP and partners. WHO is advising on guidelines for diagnosis and case management.

- WHO, UNICEF and MSF are working together to establish diphtheria treatment units in existing health facilities in the most affected districts including intensive care units for the management of severe cases. A referral system is being established to ensure suspected cases are identified, referred and treated promptly.

- WHO has delivered US$ 200 000 worth of antibiotics and 1000 vials of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) to affected governorates, and hospital equipment for treatment units are being procured.

- WHO has supplied Yareem General Hospital with fuel, water, oxygen, equipment and medicines including DAT and antibiotics.

***Vaccination***

- In November, WHO, UNICEF and partners vaccinated 8500 children under five years of age in al-Saddah and Yarim districts in Ibb governorate, where the majority of cases were reported.

- The MoPHP, UNICEF and WHO are planning a vaccination campaign to immunize children aged six weeks to seven years old with pentavalent vaccines, and children and adults aged seven to 25 years old with tetanus/diphtheria (Td) vaccines (three rounds each).

- UNICEF is delivering 600 000 doses of pentavalent vaccine and three million Td vaccine doses. Further deliveries are planned every 2–3 weeks to reach a total of 2.1 million pentavalent and nine million Td vaccines.

***Social mobilization and community engagement***

- Based on community assessments conducted by UNICEF, vaccination acceptance in Yemen is still very high.

- WHO is working with the MoPHP, UNICEF and MSF to develop a community engagement strategy to promote vaccine uptake, disseminate public health advice about diphtheria, and notify health care workers about how to refer suspect diphtheria cases for treatment.

**WHO risk assessment**

Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by toxin- producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. Respiratory diphtheria is fatal in 5–10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced global mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically in recent decades.

The occurrence of an outbreak of diphtheria indicates insufficient coverage of the national childhood immunization programmes, combined with waning immunity in previously vaccinated individuals. With ongoing transmission, there is risk for further spread of the disease to neighboring countries with low vaccination coverage.

Epidemiological surveillance for early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be strengthened in Yemen. All countries in the region should have access to laboratory testing for reliable identification of toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxins and antibiotics should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.

The risk of further disease transmission is very high at the national level and high at the regional level because of several factors including ongoing armed conflict, an unprecedented cholera outbreak that has overwhelmed the health system, disrupted health services, limited healthcare workforce, lack of financial resources to run health facilities and to pay the salaries of health workers, and sub-optimal vaccination coverage. Additionally, there is a limited supply of diphtheria antitoxin at the global level and no reagents for laboratory confirmation at the country level. Medical supplies are in a chronic shortage despite extensive support from WHO and other health partners, further complicating the delivery of life-saving healthcare in the country.

2390569,"Yellow Fever – Nigeria: Disease outbreak news, 22 December 2017 On 14 September 2017, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) informed WHO of a confirmed case of yellow fever in Kwara State. On 15 September, an official notification as per the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) was issued by the Nigerian National IHR Focal Point.

The case-patient was a 7 year-old girl from Kwara State who developed symptoms on 16 August 2017 including fever, vomiting and abdominal pain. She had no previous history of yellow fever vaccination and no travel history outside of the state in the two years prior to illness onset. Her blood sample tested positive by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and confirmed by serology tests performed at the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD).

From 2 July through 19 December 2017, 341 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported from 16 states, including Abia, Anambra, Borno, Edo, Enugu, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Kwara, Kebbi, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Oyo, Plateau, and Zamfara states. Six states have reported confirmed cases of yellow fever (Kano, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa and Zamfara).

As of 19 December, a total of 213 samples have been tested in five laboratories in Nigeria. Of these 213 samples, the Nigerian laboratories tested 63 samples positive for yellow fever and there was one inconclusive result. Of 63 samples sent to IPD for laboratory confirmation of yellow fever infection, 32 were positive, 24 were negative, and 7 results are pending at the time of publication of this update.

Of the 341 suspected cases, 214 (62.8%) are males. The most affected age group is people aged 20 years and younger who account for 65.9% of cases. The total number of deaths (among suspected, probable and confirmed cases) is 45 and nine among the confirmed cases. The case fatality rate for all cases (including suspected, probable and confirmed) is 21.1% and 28.1% for confirmed cases. Further epidemiological investigations are underway.

**Public health response**

The response to the outbreak is being coordinated by a multi-agency, multi-partner Incident Management Center and an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been established to monitor the outbreak. An EOC has also been established in Kwara state and off-site support is being provided in Zamfara state. From 18 September through 20 October 2017, rapid response teams (including epidemiologists and entomologists) from NCDC and WHO were deployed to support local authorities investigate this event further in Kwara, Kogi, and Plateau states, to assess the risk of further amplification, and to assist in conducting reactive vaccination campaigns, among other activities. Surveillance for yellow fever has been intensified nationally and a one-week training course was conducted in Lagos to improve diagnosis of yellow fever and measles, with support from WHO. To strengthen laboratory capacity, a protocol for sample management and transport was developed and shared across states. A treatment facility was designated in Kwara state. Risk communication and social mobilization activities are being implemented including public information campaigns, radio messaging and community engagement through community leaders.

Routine yellow fever vaccination was introduced to Nigeria’s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004, but the overall population immunity in areas affected by the current outbreak likely remains below herd immunity thresholds of 60–80%. Reactive vaccination campaigns targeting more than 800 000 people aged nine months to 45 years in priority communities of Kwara and Kogi states in October 2017 increased the coverage to 98% in targeted areas. A reactive vaccination campaign has also been concluded in four Local Government Areas of Zamfara state in December which vaccinated more than 1 000 000 persons. Another campaign is being conducted in five local government areas (LGAs); three in Kogi and two in Kwara states. Additionally, a pre-emptive mass campaign is planned to begin in February 2018; this campaign will initially target the six states with recently confirmed cases, followed by other priority states. This would be the next phase of a nationwide preventive campaign, planned to cover the entire country over the coming years. There is recognition that a nationwide approach is needed to achieve high levels of population immunity nationally.

**WHO risk assessment**

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever, and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommended.

Taking into consideration the reporting of suspected cases from 16 states and confirmed cases from six states, possible suboptimal immunisation coverage in affected communities, and in-country capacity to respond to sporadic cases and to conduct larger preventive campaigns (if warranted), WHO has assessed the overall risk at national level as high. There is currently a moderate risk of regional spread due to the proximity of affected states (Zamfara, and possibly Kebbi; approximately 400km from the border with Niger) and the low population immunity in this country (35.4%). The overall risk at the global level is low.

The risk of the number of cases increasing depends in part on the density of vectors competent for sustained vector-borne transmission within human populations but no entomological information is currently available outside of Kwara. The region is entering the dry season and vector densities will be lower overall, but Aedes aegypti, which can amplify yellow fever outbreaks within human populations, is an anthropophilic vector which dwells in man-made containers around houses and is moderately affected by drier conditions.

Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including cholera and Lassa fever outbreaks in other states, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country. The situation is being closely monitored.

**WHO advice**

Vaccination and mosquito control are the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.

WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers nine months of age and older going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. Nigeria also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers over one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission. Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever,using WHO approved vaccines , extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions of travel and trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.

2390564,"Fighting Cholera, fighting for Life *Ibb - December, 2017* Adeeba* 42, is from AlMakhadir district, Ibb governorate. She is the head of a family of eight people.

These days, her main problems and challenges are to find food, to be able to eat and to find water to drink, therefore, she does not focus on their quality.

“We were not that much aware about the importance of washing our hands frequently or sterilising water”, explained Adeeba. She added, “we thought that we were immunized and that water couldn’t harm us”. Adeeba mentioned that they did not regularly clean the jerry, “unless we noticed something dirty within it.” Cleaning entailed washing the can out with water only and there was no distinction made regarding how jerry will be use, for drinking or washing.

“[The jerry cans] all seem as clean to us.”

Hazim*, 48, who is living in AlMakhadir has been affected when one of his son was infected by cholera. According to Hazim, the reason is the inability to offer his family the essentail items for a proper and healthy life. He explained the situation by “the finnancial difficulties in the country during the conflict and the collaps of all officially provided services.”

In order to contain and prevent the spread of cholera in affected areas, ACTED partnered with OCHA to implement a dual community and household level emergency response, in order to improve the water supplies and hygiene environments in homes and in health facilities.

ACTED targeted households in Raymah, Al Dhale’e and Ibb communities, reaching 2,500 households with cholera prevention kits, cholera awareness sessions, and water treatment practices training. If a location with a confirmed case of cholera has a population of less than 500 households, ACTED will conduct distributions of cholera kits.

These cholera prevention kits contained a supply of aquatabs, which are tablets of chlorine to be put into water containers, soap, jerry cans, and laundry detergent powder. A single kit is designed to last a household of seven for three months, which enables households to focus on meeting other critical needs.

After receiving the cholera kit and attending hygiene and cholera awareness sessions, Hazim personally followed up with his family. He explained them the processes to wash their hands, to bring water and to store it. He mentioned that bringing water is still the task of women, by tradition and that it is rare to see men doing it. For Hazim, taking care of this process “is the matter of saving life.”

Adeeba also pointed out the hard process of bringing water from well to home, which is the responsibility of women from two to three times per day. The well is 2 kilometers away from their house. In winter, when well water is sometimes inaccessible, they have to go the as far as 5 kilometers to find water.

For Adeeba, the cholera kit helps them a lot, as it contains washing materials that she cannot currently provide for her family on a consistent basis. “The kit means that we will not have to buy cleaning materials for three months,” Adeeba said, adding, “this is a great financial help.”

Distributions of kits were accompanied with pictorial and oral instructions, covering key cholera messages. It explained the proper dosing of Aquatabs, the procedures for safe transport, handling, and storage of water; and focused as well on disinfection of household water storage containers (jerry cans), the risks of contamination via jerry cans or other household water containers and included jerry cans cleaning campaigns. All distributions were also paired with a regular water quality spot checks for free residual chlorine (FRC) at the household level.

Mohsen mentioned that he will make sure that jerry cans are cleaned daily and that the water jerry cans are seprated from washing jerry cans and that they are getting a more specific and more careful treatment.

Moreover, the awarness sessions taught Hazim to not only observe the proper practices for him and his family at home, but to also to be aware of the cleanliness of the environment around his house. “There is no sanitation services and the government services often cannot provide clean water, sanitation, or solid waste management.”

“The distribution of the kit and the cholera prevention awareness session change a lot of my thoughts about what should be and what are the best practice to apply” Mohsen said, adding, “it taught me how thing could be changed when more concerns and acts are applied.”

2390519,"Statement on behalf of the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, 22 December 2017 Special Envoy de Mistura attended today the Astana meeting, which was hosted very effectively by President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and organised under the auspices of the three guarantors of the 30 December 2016 ceasefire – the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Turkey. The Special Envoy reiterated his belief that maintaining and enhancing the deescalation of violence remains an essential contribution to the shaping of an environment conducive to a political progress in Syria as per Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). Through his presence and activity in Astana, the Special Envoy reaffirmed his keenness in this regard. 

Noting his concern over the lack of progress on urgent humanitarian issues despite the establishment of deescalation zones, with no access to besieged locations during the month of December, the Special Envoy called for unhindered humanitarian access throughout the country. In particular, he emphasised it was urgent for the United Nations to be able to deliver immediate life-saving assistance to all besieged locations, as well as undertake urgent medical evacuations from Eastern Ghouta. In his capacity as Special Envoy, and subject to endorsement by the United Nations headquarters, he also welcomes the fact that there has been some progress on important confidence-building measures, such as humanitarian demining. 

On the issue of detainees, abductees and missing persons, the Special Envoy has taken note of an agreement on a working group for the release of detainees and abductees and on the exchange of information on missing persons. He considers this is commendable as a first step towards reaching a comprehensive arrangement between the conflicting parties. The United Nations reiterates that real progress on the release of detainees, and the exchange of information about abductees and missing persons, consistent with resolution 2254 (2015), is crucial. This should be achieved through establishing the standing working group discussed in details in previous Astana meetings. The United Nations will continue to emphasise the need for meetings of this working group to happen on a systematic basis. 

Further to his meetings in Moscow yesterday with Russian Defence Minister Shoigu and Foreign Minister Lavrov, Special Envoy de Mistura had further exchanges with guarantors in Astana on the initiative to convene a congress of national dialogue in Sochi, planned to take place in January 2018. The United Nations maintains its view that any political initiative by international actors should be assessed by its ability to contribute to and support the mandated political process under the United Nations in Geneva and the full implementation of resolution 2254 (2015). The Special Envoy will be consulting the Secretary-General once he has received all the information required. 

In the meantime, the Special Envoy recalls his intention to convene a ninth round of intra-Syrian talks under the auspices of the United Nations in January, which he announced to the Security Council in his briefing of 19 December and discussed in Washington DC and Moscow earlier this week. The focus of this round will continue to be the full implementation of resolution 2254 (2015), with a specific focus on the constitutional and electoral baskets of the agenda while continuing to explore other baskets. He is looking forward to making substantive progress with the Syrian delegations in this context, as the round will be an important opportunity to assess the readiness and ability of the parties with the support of the international community to advance a political solution to the Syrian crisis under the aegis of the United Nations in Geneva, as called for by resolution 2254 (2015).

2390484,"Honduras: Population Movement DREF Final Report (MDRHN010) **A. Situation Analysis**

**Description of the Disaster**

• November 2015: The authorities at the National Migration Institute (INM for its acronym in Spanish) estimated that around 20,000 people – of mainly Cuban origin – passed through the region in 2014 and 2015.

• August 2016: The INM’s Regional Office and the Centre for Assistance to Irregular Migrants (CAMI for its acronym in Spanish) received requests for assistance from an average of 2,500 migrants per month.

• September 2016: The Honduran Red Cross signed a letter of understanding with the INM to coordinate the humanitarian response actions following the emergency that affected irregular migrants.

• October 2016: The HRC began implementing the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) operation:  
The HRC provided services to around 5,500 migrants, thereby exceeding the original target population of 4,000 migrants; the services included basic first aid care, the distribution of personal hygiene kits and key messages to promote hygiene as well as a restoring family links (RFL), which was jointly implemented with the ICRC, so that people could contact their families through the provision of a free telephone call. The migrants were mainly of Caribbean origin from countries such as Haiti and Cuba, while a smaller percentage of migrants were from the continent of Africa, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Senegal, Angola, Kenya as well as Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, India, among others.  

The situation at the CAMI evolved in terms of the number of migrants entering the country, ending with a low level of migrants at the close of the operations. In January and February 2017, less than 1,200 migrants were received, meaning that the administrative process was faster. In addition, there was less demand for the HRC’s services; however, there was high demand for first aid care, which was received positively by the migrants.",267,"English"
2390469,"UNHCR: First evacuation of 162 vulnerable refugees from Libya to Italy UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, announced today the evacuation of 162 highly vulnerable refugees from Libya to Italy, including unaccompanied children and women who had been held captive for extended periods of time.

“For the first time, we have been able to evacuate vulnerable refugees straight from Libya to Italy. This is really ground-breaking and a much welcomed development that could not have happened without the strong commitment of the Italian authorities and the support of the Libyan Government. We really hope other countries will follow the same path,” said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean Situation.

“Some of those evacuated suffered tremendously and were held captive in inhumane conditions while in Libya. Five of these women gave birth while in detention, with only the very limited medical assistance we were able to provide with our partner on the ground, IMC,” added Cochetel.

The group of Eritrean, Ethiopian, Somali and Yemeni refugees include families, single mothers, unaccompanied children and disabled people. All of them need health care and counselling.

After their release from detention, they were accompanied by Libya-based UNHCR staff to Tripoli and then to Italy, where they landed at a military base, near Rome, and were transferred to the Italian authorities.

Upon arrival, all refugees went through medical checks and were given warm clothes and a hot meal before undergoing identification procedures. UNHCR teams composed of cultural mediators and legal experts were deployed to provide the evacuees with information on the asylum procedure. The refugees were then transferred to several reception facilities. Humanitarian care and accommodation was provided by the Episcopal Conference of Italy through Caritas.

In parallel, a third evacuation from Libya to Niger will be organized in the coming days, bringing an additional 150 refugees to safety.

“With this last evacuation to Niger, the total number of refugees taken out from Libya in the space of six weeks will reach 400,” said Cochetel. “This has only been made possible after intensive efforts from our staff and partner organizations. The smile of relief on the faces of those evacuated is a source of additional motivation to save more. We really count on international solidarity to help us reach our objective of bringing to protection 1,300 highly vulnerable refugees out of Libya as soon as possible.”

These efforts must be part of broader asylum building and migration management efforts to address the complex movement of migrants and refugees in Libya and along the routes leading to this country, concluded Cochetel.

2390429,"The 2017 voices on gender equality you cannot miss The year 2017 has seen some turbulent changes. Protest movements, legal reforms, political upheavals dominated the headlines. Will 2017 be the watershed moment for gender equality, as brave women break their silence on gender-based violence in unprecedented numbers, and men and women come together to challenge inequality and stereotypes?

At UN Women, we work with brave women and men every single day, many of whom you may never have heard of. Women who have broken the barriers at home and in politics, men who have refused to stay silent bystanders, and refugees who have shown us what resilience looks like.

Take a look back at some of their stories.

In February 2017, Sdiri founded Entr@crush, a new kind of online platform for Tunisian youth who have entrepreneurial ideas, to network with like-minded people, donors and entrepreneurs. It provides e-learning courses in a variety of topics, from management and accounting to communications, to prepare young entrepreneurs.

She says, “One day, I want to wake up to find gender equality is real. I will stay out late that night; I will wear whatever I want to, without worrying about being harassed. I will be free to live by myself if I wanted to; I will earn as much as a man.”

Koyesh Miah attends Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in Bangladesh and until recently, used to be a silent bystander, like many others, when other men sexually harassed women. Since participating in a UN Women programme, Miah started to understand the serious ramifications of sexual harassment and is ready to tackle it head on.

Koyesh says: “Before we joined the campaign group, many of us thought [sexual harassment] was harmless fun...We didn’t realize how our behaviour affected women and girls.

Through the campaign, students got the opportunity to hear from their female classmates about the way they feel about sexual harassment. It helped us understand how much this so-called ‘funny’ behaviour humiliated women and girls…how it affects their self-esteem, confidence, mobility and opportunities.

Today I know how to raise my voice against sexual harassment. Whenever and wherever a girl faces harassment in front of me, now I never think twice about protesting.”

Oralia is the treasurer of a women-led association, Asociación Comunitaria Integral Productiva in the village of Urlanta, in the south-eastern region of Guatemala. She is also the founding member of the Guatemalan organization, “Women to Generate Rural Success” (MUGER). Oralia’s daily routine consists of managing 53 hives that produce 150 bottles of honey in peak season.

Before the project, women were expected to have babies and stay home, while the men earned and made all the decisions. But with funding from UN Women and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the female beekeepers of Urlanta have brought sustainable jobs and income to their communities and challenged gender roles.

Oralia says, “ Surrounded by the bees, I think about all that we can still accomplish. When I’m stung, I am reminded of how strong I already am.”

2390409,"FAO Rice Market Monitor, December 2017, Volume XX - Issue No. 4 **ROUND UP** 

Since the October issue of the RMM, FAO has raised its forecast of world paddy production in 2017 by 2.1 million tonnes to 756.7 million tonnes (502.2 million tonnes, milled basis). The revisions primarily mirrors improved crop prospects for China (Mainland) and Myanmar, although Pakistan, the Philippines, Sierra Leone are all predicted to gather more than reported in October.  
Combined, these changes more than offset various downward revisions, the largest of which concerning Bangladesh and Madagascar.  

At the revised level of 756.7 million tonnes, global paddy production would surpass the 2016 all-time high by a small margin of 0.2 percent. From a regional perspective, the comparatively stable outlook mirrors prospects of only modest output growth in Asia, where uneven rainfall patterns look set to temper area expansions promoted by continued state assistance and positive margins. Put together, countries in Asia are seen producing 684.2 million tonnes in 2017, up 1.4 million tonnes from the 2016 record. The largest absolute expansions in the region are expected to take place in China (Mainland), Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, but Cambodia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Timor Leste are all set to gather larger crops. The outlook is more subdued elsewhere, especially for South Asian producers that experienced a series of weather setbacks. This was namely the case of Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka and, to a lesser extent, India. Afghanistan, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Turkey and Viet Nam are all similarly set to face production declines this season.  

FAO’s outlook continues to point to 2017 production in Africa exceeding the 2016 all-time high by 1 percent to reach 31.1 million tonnes. Generally favorable precipitation levels through September permitted producers in most West African countries to react to attractive prices and government assistance programs by expanding plantings. Prospects are also positive for Egypt, more than compensating for contractions in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Niger and, especially Madagascar and the United Republic of Tanzania, where crops were impaired by erratic rains.",267,"English"
2390399,"Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of 19:30, 21 December 2017 This report is for the media and the general public.

At 22 Nezalezhnosti Ukrainy Street, the SMM saw holes in the north-west-facing side of a three-storey building. The SMM assessed that the damage had been caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon probably fired from a north-westerly direction. A female worker (in her thirties) in the building told the SMM that shelling had occurred at around 13:00 on 19 December.

At 22/2 Sovetska Street on 21 December, the SMM saw a hole in the west-facing side of a two-storey house, assessed as caused by a round of a 30mm cannon fired from a westerly direction. The SMM also saw a destroyed storage building 10m south of the house. A female resident (in her sixties) told the SMM that she had been at home when she had heard an impact and saw smoke and dust emanating from the roof of the storage building at around 12:00 on 19 December.

In Yasynuvata, at 50 Zavodska Street, the SMM saw a fresh crater in the yard 3m north of a single-storey house, assessed as caused by a round of an undetermined weapon fired from a northerly direction. The SMM also saw shrapnel damage to the north-facing roof, side and gate of the house, as well as shrapnel damage to the ceiling and walls of a room in the northern side of the house. A resident (in his forties) of the house told the SMM that shelling had occurred between 20:30 and 20:50 on 20 December while he, his wife and a 12-year-old daughter had been at home. He said that they had laid on the floor and covered themselves with mattresses until shelling had ended.

At 11 Kvartal 102 Street, the SMM saw a fresh hole in the ceiling of a kitchen in apartment no. 73 on the top floor of a seven-storey residential building as well as shattered north-facing windows. In apartment no. 75 on the top floor of the same building, the SMM saw a fresh hole in the wall at the northern side of the kitchen and shattered north-facing windows through the hole. The SMM assessed that both cases of damage above had been caused by rounds of an undetermined weapon fired from a northerly direction.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On the evening of 18 December, the SMM camera in “DPR”-controlled Petrivske recorded two tracer rounds in flight from south-east to north-west at unknown distances south-west (unable to assess whether inside or outside the disengagement area). On the evening of 19 December, the same camera recorded an undetermined explosion at an unknown distance north-north-west.

On the evening of 20 December, while on the eastern edge of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard over 150 undetermined explosions 10km west.

In the early hours of 21 December, the SMM camera in government-controlled Zolote recorded two bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 2-3km north-north-east, assessed as outside the disengagement area.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum, as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines, in government-controlled areas, the SMM saw 12 anti-tank guns (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm) near Sievierodonetsk (74km north-west of Luhansk). Aerial imagery on 10 December revealed a probable tank (either T-64 or T-72) near Novotroitske (36km south-west of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a government-controlled area, aerial imagery on 10 December revealed the presence of two surface-to-air missile systems (9K35 Strela-10 and 9K36) in Donske (57km south of Donetsk).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in a non-government-controlled area, the SMM saw three stationary tanks (T-64) in firing positions near Myrne (28km south-west of Luhansk). (See SMM Daily Report 20 December 2017.)

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas beyond the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM saw one surface-to-air missile system (9K31 Strela-1) and eight MLRS (9P138 Grad-1, 122mm), and noted that 15 MLRS (11 BM-21 and four 9P138), one self-propelled howitzer (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm), one surface-to-air missile system (9K35) and 21 anti-tank guns (18 MT-12 and three D-48, 85mm) continued to be absent.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles and an anti-aircraft gun[2] in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, an SMM mini UAV spotted an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) near Chermalyk. Aerial imagery on 10 December revealed the presence of six infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (five BMP-2 and one BMP-1) near Novotroitske.

The SMM observed the removal of a mine at the northern entrance of government-controlled Hnutove (20km north-east of Mariupol). The SMM saw 15 Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel present, two of whom were handling an anti-tank mine (TM-62) and storing it in a tarpaulin bag near a checkpoint. One of them told the SMM that the State Emergency Services had removed the mine from a field earlier that day. The SMM saw a stationary vehicle with “State Emergency Services” written in Ukrainian on the side.

In both Donetsk and Luhansk regions the SMM observed convoys of trucks with “Humanitarian Aid from the Russian Federation” written in Russian on the side. At the south-eastern edge of “LPR”-controlled Luhansk city at 08:55 on 21 December, the SMM saw a convoy of 16 covered white cargo trucks (five with black Russian Federation military licence places and the remainder with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates) on road M04 heading north-west. The convoy was escorted by at least three cars (white in colour with two orange stripes on the sides) with blue flashing lights on, three white-and-blue cars, and an ambulance (some of them with Russian Federation licence plates and the remainder not seen). The SMM saw one of the trucks with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates leave the convoy and heading north-west. Later, the Mission observed the convoy enter a compound at 4A Darhomyzhskoho Street in the southern outskirts of Luhansk city. When the SMM attempted to enter the compound, two armed “LPR” members wearing clothes with “LPR” “police” written in Russian denied its access, claiming that the SMM would not be given access without permission from other “LPR” members.*

At 1 Baumana Street in “DPR”-controlled Donetsk city’s Budonivskyi district (6km south-east of city centre) at around 11:00 on 21 December, the SMM saw five covered white cargo trucks (one with black Russian Federation places and four with white Russian Federation licence plates) parked along the side of the street in front of a storage facility. In the compound, the SMM saw about 20 covered cargo trucks being unloaded. Later that day, at 14:15, the SMM saw a convoy of 28 covered cargo trucks (all with white civilian Russian Federation licence plates), escorted by three cars with black Russian Federation military licence places and a car with “police” written in Russian (with “DPR” plates), on T0507 heading east near “DPR”-controlled Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk).

The SMM visited four border areas outside government control. At the border crossing point near Uspenka, during two hours, the SMM saw 111 cars (39 with “DPR” plates), five vans (one with “DPR” plates), three buses, 81 covered cargo trucks (20 with “DPR” plates) exiting Ukraine, and 71 cars (34 with “DPR” plates), ten vans (four with “DPR” plates), 16 covered cargo trucks (six with “DPR” plates), two fuel trucks and two buses (one with “DPR” plates) entering Ukraine. A woman in her forties near the crossing point told the SMM that between 06:00 and 06:30 on 21 December she saw around 20-25 trucks enter Ukraine, being escorted by “police” cars heading west. A man in his forties told the SMM that he had seen a convoy of around 20 trucks in “DPR”-controlled Kuteinykove (42km south-east from Donetsk), about 35km west-north-west of Uspenka.

At the border crossing point near Marynivka (78km east of Donetsk), during one hour, the SMM saw 14 cars (one with “DPR” plates), two vans and six pedestrians (five men and one woman, aged 40-50) entering Ukraine, and 31 cars (seven with “DPR” plates), three vans (two with “DPR” plates) and four covered cargo trucks exiting Ukraine.

At the border crossing point near Izvaryne (52km south-east of Luhansk), during an hour, the SMM saw 15 cars (two with “LPR” plates), two buses, five covered cargo trucks and 160 pedestrians (94 women and 66 men, aged 35-60) exiting Ukraine, and 22 cars, three buses and 58 pedestrians (39 women and 19 men, aged 35-60) entering Ukraine.

At the border crossing point near Sievernyi (50km southeast of Luhansk), during about 25 minutes, the SMM saw 11 pedestrians (seven women and four men, aged 40-60) entering Ukraine, and two men in their forties exiting Ukraine.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Chernivtsi and Kyiv.",267,"English"

Congolese refugees as of 30 November 2017

**43,000**      
Congolese new arrivals from January to November 2017

**4,430**      
Congolese new arrivals since 1 December 2017

**HIGHLIGHTS**     

- Since 18 December, over 2,650 new refugee arrivals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have crossed to Uganda, four times the average daily arrival recorded between January and November 2017. The vast majority (2,300) entered Uganda crossing Lake Albert aboard rickety fishing boats, with others (350) coming in through more commonly used border points in Kisoro, Kanungu and Bundibugyo districts. The Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) reported that many more refugees have reached reception centres and settlements on their own. 

- This week has been characterised by two major developments: firstly, the unexpected surge of arrivals to Kyangwali settlement through the Lake Albert route; secondly, the arrival of the first major convoy of Congolese refugees to Kyaka II settlement. Since Rwamwanja settlement, which used to receive Congolese refugees entering through south-western Uganda, has reached full capacity, all Congolese new arrivals in South-West will be settled in Kyaka II from now on. 

- The refugees crossing Lake Albert arrived to Sebagoro, a village some 270 kilometers northwest of the Ugandan capital Kampala. This route is being used by a large number of refugees for the first time after a tragic shipwreck in 2014 that left over 200 dead. The new arrivals, mostly women and children, are reportedly fleeing intercommunal violence at Djugu territory in the DRC. Since Monday, there were reports of houses being scorched in the area, and people attacked with machetes and firearms. More than 20 villages were abandoned due to the fear of reprisals. Refugees reported that many more people are gathering on the Congolese side of Lake Albert waiting for their turn to cross, despite the journey’s high cost. 

- UNHCR and partners are stepping up their capacity to help local authorities respond to the situation. The refugees receive basic relief assistance in Sebagoro and are then transferred by African Initiative for Relief and Development to Kyangwali settlement, some 50 kilometers to the east. There, refugees are registered by OPM and medically screened by Action Africa Help. UNHCR carries out protection screening to identify and assist persons with specific needs, including unaccompanied minors and separated children, survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and pregnant women. WFP is providing hot meals and UNICEF is ready to provide 20,000 polio and measles vaccines. The Police Marine Forces are increasing their boat patrols in the lake to reduce the risks of fatal boating incidents. 

- As of Thursday, 21 December, the Nyakabande Transit Centre in Kisoro district was highly congested with over 2,000 Congolese refugees. To ease pressure on the transit facility, a first convoy carrying 734 Congolese refugees departed on 21 December for Kyaka II settlement. The journey took over 12 hours requiring UNHCR and partners in Kyaka II to work until 3:00 am to assist the arrivals. Convoys from Kisoro to Kyaka II are now scheduled to take place once or twice a week at least, depending on the influx rate. 

- In anticipation of further influxes from DRC and as a preparedness measure, partners continue to work to construct a transit centre in Matanda (Kanungu district), to upgrade Bubukwanga transit facility (Bundibugyo district), and to enhance reception in the Kyangwali area (Hoima district).",267,"English"
2390354,"Special Report: FAO/WFP Crop and Livestock Assessment Mission to Mongolia **Mission Highlights**

- A severe drought in mid-2017 gravely affected large agricultural producing areas and pasture rangelands.

- The 2017 production of wheat, the country's main staple food, is forecast at 231 000 tonnes, almost half of last year’s high level and more than 40 percent lower than the average of the previous five years. The impact on other crops, including potatoes, barley, oats and buckwheat, was also severe.

- Reduced pastureland resulted in below-average livestock body conditions. The impact on livestock is further compounded by the drought-reduced hay and fodder availability, which is estimated at 53 million tonnes, the lowest level since 2007. These conditions raise serious concerns over the occurrence of a dzud1 event in the winter/spring months.

- In October, prices of meat products were well below their levels a year earlier, mainly due to increased herders’ sales on fears of animal losses during the winter/spring months and the need of buying hay to sustain remaining animals.

- Wheat import requirements in the 2017/18 marketing year (October/September) are forecast at about 230 000 tonnes, considerably above the five-year average. It is expected that required imports will be fully covered by commercial purchases.

- With the decrease in crop production, many farmers were unable to repay debts and have reduced hiring of seasonal labour - eliminating the primary income source for the season for many wage labour households.

- Poor pasture land conditions have forced herders to find alternative fodder sources by traveling long distances to collect hay and/or procuring hay at higher than usual prices.

- With reduced meat prices, herders must decide between selling at a lower than normal price or maintaining their animals through the winter.

- Access to credit is crucial for many households in the winter and spring when incomes are reduced.  
Herder households with less than 200 animals do not have sufficient collateral to receive a loan.

- Previous dzud events have led to loss of livelihoods and mass migration to urban ger districts where infrastructure, public services are limited, and poverty and food insecurity rates are high, particularly in the winter and spring.

**1. OVERVIEW** 

An FAO/WFP Crop and Livestock Assessment Mission visited Mongolia from 15 to 28 October 2017, prompted by the prolonged drought from mid-May to end-July that sharply reduced the 2017 crop output and depleted rangeland conditions, raising serious concerns over the impact on the livestock ahead of the winter/spring period. 

The Mission estimated the impact of the dry weather on the 2017 wheat, potatoes and vegetable production and forecast the expected wheat deficit for 2017/18 marketing year (October/September). The Mission assessed also the impact of the dry weather on hay production and fodder supplies for the livestock sector for the forthcoming winter/spring months, up to April 2018. Furthermore, the mission assessed the impact of the drought on households, their coping strategies and contingency plans in view of the coming winter. 

The Mission visited seven of Mongolia’s 21 provinces in Khangai and Central regions. The team was composed by three international staff from FAO/WFP and national agricultural officers. 

Prior to departing to the field, the Mission was briefed on current crop production and livestock performance as well as general macroeconomic context by several national and international institutions and obtained national and province-wise data on precipitation, crop production and livestock numbers, prices, inputs availability and trade. Institutions visited were the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry (MoFALI), the Parliament House, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the National Statistics Office (NSO), the Meat Producers Association, the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour (MSWL). 

The Mission obtained MoFALI data at provincial and district level of crop harvested area, yield and production estimates. During the field work, obtained data was cross-checked against information provided by farmers, including smallholders and large scale wheat producers, and against Vegetation Health Index (VHI) images, estimated rainfall and other remotely sensed meteorological data provided by FAO/GIEWS. Visits to food markets with interviews with traders were also conducted. The Mission conducted structured interviews with a number of herders and farmers to assess the impact of the drought and analyse households’ winter preparedness and coping strategies ahead of the winter/spring.  

In 2017, a prolonged period of severe dry weather between mid-May and end of July, intensified by extreme high temperatures in June, damaged large swatches of cropped areas and caused a severe deterioration of pastures and rangeland conditions. An estimated 80 percent of the country was affected by drought conditions. This resulted in severe yield and area losses of the 2017 crops, including wheat, potatoes, barley, oats and buckwheat. The 2017 wheat production is estimated at about 231 000 tonnes, almost half of last year’s high level and over 40 percent less than the five-year average. Similarly, potatoes output is estimated at about 117 000 tonnes, 23 percent less than in 2016 and 36 percent below the previous five-year average.  

The wheat import requirements in 2017/18 marketing year are forecast at about 230 000 tonnes, considerably above the five-year average and close to the 2015/16 level, when imports reached 215 000 tonnes in response to a drought-reduced wheat output. Imports are expected to be fully covered by commercial purchases.  

Drought also caused a severe deterioration of pasture conditions, which prevented livestock to gain fat stores and strengthen core muscle strength, critical to overcome the normally harsh winter/spring months. According to MoFALI data, as of November 2017, overall livestock body condition is 14 percent below average. Body conditions were reported to be particularly poor in Khangai and Central regions’ provinces. Drought-reduced hay and fodder availabilities, coupled with weak livestock conditions, rise serious concerns over the impact of the winter/spring months on livestock and livelihoods.  

Retail prices of wheat flour have remained stable in recent months, but are expected to increase in early 2018 due to reduced availability of wheat grains following the 2017 severely reduced output. In October, prices of meat products were reportedly lower than a year earlier, due to poor livestock body conditions and increase of distressed sales of animals in most markets. Most herders have decided to sell larger amounts of livestock, even at lower prices, ahead of further deterioration of their body conditions and high probability of increased mortality during winter/spring months. By contrast, prices of dairy products are reportedly higher than in 2016, mainly due to reduced animal productivity due to drought.  

The reduced crop production resulted in widespread indebtedness of farmers, who were forced to drastically reduce the use of seasonal wage labour. As a consequence, the loss of wage labour opportunities left a significant number of households who live in wheat producing areas with reduced employment and limited alternative sources of income.  

Harsh winters following summer droughts significantly increase risks for herders to lose their animals. As past events have demonstrated, the loss of livestock assets is likely to determine large migration movements into urban areas in search for economic support. Migratory groups often settle in suburban areas of capital city Ulaanbaatar, known as ger, where there are virtually no infrastructures and public services, and face food security issues, particularly during the winter periods.",267,"English"

December 22, 2017

Conflict and persecution have left more than sixty-five million people displaced in recent years, signaling a worrying trend, says David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, a U.S.-based humanitarian organization. Miliband, the author of the new book [_Rescue: Refugees and the Political Crisis of Our Time_](https://www.amazon.com/Rescue-Refugees-Political-Crisis-Books/dp/1501154397), says that mass displacement, which continued through 2017, requires commitments not only from governments but also the private sector, civil society, and the international financial organizations to meet immediate needs and provide economic opportunity and education for refugee communities. “Although political crisis causes humanitarian crisis, untended humanitarian crisis can also lead to political instability,” he says.

2390239,"IOM Iraq Holds Community Policing Conference on Ninewa [EN/AR] Baghdad - IOM Iraq’s Community Policing programme in cooperation with Iraq’s Ministry of Interior held a conference on 20 December 2017 on the promotion of cooperation between law enforcement agents and community members towards peace and security in Ninewa Governorate.

Ninewa was deeply affected by the recent conflict, with heavy damage to its infrastructure – especially in its capital Mosul – and extensive displacement, as more than 941,000 individuals continue to be displaced across the governorate.

IOM Iraq’s Migration Management Unit has been focusing on the implementation of the project “Strengthening Community Policing in Iraq” in retaken areas of Ninewa and other conflict-affected areas since the project began in 2016.

The conference followed a series of activities in November and December that included the establishment of five new Community Policing Forums (CPFs) in Ninewa and training for more than 400 individuals, including police officers, community members and civil society representatives, on applying community policing in a context of post-conflict returns. 

The conference was preceded by a three-day workshop exploring the role of women in security dialogue. Over 80 women and men from across Iraq participated, including police, civil society representatives and the community members, to discuss the impact of gender-based violence on community security, the role of women in violent extremism and how women and children affiliated with ISIL should be treated. Workshop participants formed working groups on these topics, and discussed how to implement action plans developed in the event.

The Community Policing conference on Ninewa was held in Baghdad and attended by government officials, notably Mr. Saad Maan, spokesman of the Ministry of Interior, the Head of Community Police Directorate Brigadier General Khalid Al Mhannah, NGO staff and CPFs representatives from Mosul, Fallujah and Baghdad.

Speakers included CPF members from Al-Amiriat Al-Fallujah and Mosul (Baasheka), police officers, community members and civil society organization representatives, who introduced the CP model and discussed the successes and challenges of the CPFs in Ninewa. The conference gave the CPF members the opportunity to network and share experiences.

IOM Iraq Community Policing project is funded by the German Federal Foreign Office.

“The sharing of experiences, successes and challenges of Community Policing Forums in retaken areas will help us to tailor the next phase of implementation of this programme and the follow up actions that will continue to strengthen this model, based on mutual trust and responsibility in Iraq”, said IOM Iraq Chief of Mission Gerard Waite.

“I am very grateful for the cooperation between the Iraq and German governments in the Community Policing project,” said Dr. Cyrill Nunn, German Ambassador to Iraq. “We have high hopes that the success of the project can contribute to the much-needed reconciliation and stabilization in Iraq,” added the German Ambassador, highlighting the valuable contribution of the CP model to the stabilization of the Iraqi social fabric.

CPFs are inclusive platforms that include police, local leadership, civil society organization representatives and community members, where citizens can raise their security concerns. CPFs identify and develop initiatives that lead to safer communities, protect the most vulnerable and enhance cooperation, transparency and mutual trust between these actors. The CP model encourages CPF members to analyze the available resources in their respective communities and to assess the ability of a wide range of actors to find solutions to situations that are potentially dangerous and harmful. As such, CPFs are tools for conflict prevention.

Brigadier General Saad Maan, spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, thanked the German Government, IOM and guests for their efforts in support of the CP model. “We have been working very hard to put the Iraqi citizens first. There will be no sustainable security in the governorates unless citizens are part of it, and that is exactly the foundation of this initiative, by implementing the CP model across the country, mainly in Ninewa. We have achieved great results in stabilizing the country thanks to the cooperation with our international partners,” said Saad Maan.

A total of 66 CPFs have been established across Iraq; 42 established by IOM’s CP project, and 24 independently established by local police and communities, building on the CPFs model.

Speakers included CPF members from Al-Amiriat Al-Fallujah and Mosul (Baasheka), police officers, community members and civil society organization representatives, who introduced the CP model and discussed the successes and challenges of the CPFs in Ninevwa. The conference cave the CPF members the opportunity to network and share experiences.

IOM Iraq Community Policing project is financed by the German Federal Foreign Office.

""The sharing of experiences, successes and challenges of Community Policing Forums in retaken areas will help us to tailor the next phase of implementation of this program and the follow up actions that will continue to strengthen this model, based on mutual trust and responsibility in Iraq ""Said IOM Iraq Chief of Mission Gerard Waite.

""I am very grateful for the cooperation between the Iraq and German governments in the Community Policing project,"" said Dr. Cyrill Nunn, German Ambassador to Iraq. ""We have high hopes that the success of the project can contribute to the much-needed reconciliation and stabilization in Iraq,"" added the German Ambassador, highlighting the valuable contribution of the CP model to the stabilization of the Iraqi social fabric.

CPFs are inclusive platforms that include police, local leadership, civil society organizations and members community, where citizens can raise their security concerns. CPFs identify and develop initiatives that lead to safer communities, protect the most vulnerable and enhance cooperation, transparency and mutual trust between these actors. The CP model encourages CPF members to analyze the available resources in their respective communities and to assess the ability of a wide range of actors to find solutions to situations that are potentially dangerous and harmful. As such, CPFs are tools for conflict prevention.

Brigadier General Saad Maan, spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, thanked the German Government, IOM and guests for their efforts in support of the CP model. ""We have been working very hard to put the Iraqi citizens first. There will be no sustainable security in the governors unless citizens are part of it, and that is exactly the foundation of this initiative, by implementing the CP model across the country, mainly in Ninewa. We have achieved great results in stabilizing the country thanks to the cooperation with our international partners, ""said Saad Maan.

A total of 66 CPFs have been established across Iraq; 42 established by IOM's CP project, and 24 independently established by local police and communities, building on the CPFs model.

2390229,"WFP Nigeria Situation Report #23, 1-30 November 2017 **Highlights**

- In November WFP, both directly and through partnerships, provided food assistance to 1,160,000 people (97 percent of the plan of the month) through in-kind distributions (75 percent) and cash-based transfers (25 percent) in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.

- The onset of the dry season triggered an increase in attacks and renewed military operations in November, particularly in Borno State and parts of Adamawa State. This has caused additional population displacement, substantial casualties, and restricted humanitarian access.

**Situation Update**

- An increase in the number of security incidents is being reported. Non-State Armed Group (NSAG) carried out suicide attacks in Mubi and Madagali towns (Adamawa State), and Magumeri town (Borno State). The Secretary-General strongly condemned the suicide attacks in Mubi, the deadliest this year, and expressed particular concerns as several humanitarian organisations have established their presence in this town to better access vulnerable people in Adamawa.

- Harvests concluded at the end of November across the country. FEWSNET reports that countrywide the cereal production is 9 percent higher than last year and the impact of the harvests combined with other improving macroeconomic indicators has produced a decline in food prices countrywide.

- Although the aggregate production of cereals has been above average across the country, the December FEWSNET and WFP joint market monitoring bulletin reported that the prices of food commodities monitored across the markets in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States have increased compared to last year, as the conflict has affected the local harvest.

- The joint market monitoring bulletin also reported that recent recovery in oil export revenues, coupled with relatively stable inflation, is helping to gradually drive Nigeria’s economy out of recession.

- The food security situation in Northeast Nigeria remains extremely fragile and although the risk of famine has so far been averted, in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe 2.56 million people are currently in need of food assistance.

- Without maintained and even expanded humanitarian food and livelihood assistance, 3.7 million people will be estimated to be at risk of critical food insecurity in the next lean season, June to August 2008.

- Across the three states an estimated 560,000 children 6 to 59 months are acutely malnourished - 310,000 children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and 251,000 with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Further, an estimated 230,000 pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished.

- The IOM-DTM reports from January to October 2017 (Rounds XIV to XIX) indicate that food assistance remains a priority need for displaced households particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.

- During the month sectors and humanitarian partners, including WFP, have been carrying in-depth joint needs assessments in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States whose findings are to feed into the Humanitarian Needs Overview and the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, both to be finalised by mid-December.

- Across the border, tensions increased in Cameroon between the government and Anglophone minority and the dry season has allowed thousands of Englishspeaking Cameroonians to begin fleeing across the border into Nigeria Cross River State via four entry points with Cameroon. UNHCR is currently providing food and non-food items (NFIs) to the 5,277 already registered asylum seekers.

- Taking into consideration the potential deterioration of the situation WFP, UNHCR and partners have elaborated a contingency plan and a technical coordination meeting will be held with government authorities in Cross-River state on 18 December.",267,"English"

As people gathered for the performance in front of the Lotte New York Palace Hotel, they realized that the words to the familiar song had been changed with lyrics describing the pain and fear of those trapped in conflict areas around the world, and the hope and relief that can be provided by humanitarian aid.

""This is not your typical Silent Night,"" said Nyawal, 23, a South Sudanese refugee who sings in the choir. ""This is a version of a holiday carol that tells the story of people like us.""

The women are no strangers to suffering themselves, as each of them is a from a conflict area - ranging from Iraq to Sudan. The words they sing are helping to build awareness of conflict around the world and drive donations to the United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which helps people caught up in crises.

""Every year, millions of people around the world are struck by crises not of their own making,"" said UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock. ""This song shines a light on their experiences, and emphasizes how humanitarian aid can make a difference. CERF is one of the fastest ways to support people in need whenever and wherever a crisis strikes. Each donation helps CERF prepare for the crises yet to come.""

The performance has been turned into a docu-style video now available on social media until 7 January 2017, with the goal of raising funds for CERF. Please visit the UN CERF Facebook page or DonateMiracles.org to support this effort.

2390134,"Israel & the State of Palestine CAAC Bulletin – Fourth quarter of 2016: Children Affected by Armed Conflict Since 2007, a UNICEF-led working group has consolidated efforts to report on the impact of armed conflict on children in Israel and the State of Palestine. The bulletin is published on a quarterly basis highlighting trends and patterns in grave violations against children. 

Members of the working group include: B’Tselem, DCI-Palestine, OCHA, OHCHR, Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Terre Des Homme – Suisse, Save the Children, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNRWA, UNMAS, War Child Holland, WHO and World Vision. 

This edition covers October, November and December 2016. 

**Update as of September 2017:** The Principals of Working Group member organizations met in August 2017 and reaffirmed their commitment to continue to generate accurate and reliable data on the situation of children affected by the conflict In Israel and the State of Palestine and to put this data in the public domain for advocacy purposes and to improve the situation of children. They will continue to work to improve the content and format of the CAAC bulletins and implement specific actions to that end. They also agreed to move forward with a similar but distinct ‘bulletin approach’ on other non-conflict related child rights issues of concern in an effort to ensure a more comprehensive approach to the child rights agenda. They reaffirmed the need for engagement with all concerned parties. UNICEF, as the chair of the Working Group, is also in the process of reaching out to other human rights organizations who may be able to provide additional data on grave child rights violations and, where relevant, will propose their inclusion in the Working Group.

**MAJOR TRENDS & VIOLATIONS**

The situation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip remained tense in the fourth quarter of 2016. A total of 1,305 incidents were documented in the reporting period, affecting 10,831 children. This marks a sharp increase from the preceding quarter when 746 incidents affecting 3,291 children were reported. This is mainly due to a significant rise in the number of children affected by education-related incidents following the restart of the school year: 8,993 children compared to 1,693 in the third quarter, with 103 education-related incidents registered in the last quarter of 2016, compared to 25 in the third quarter.

The number of children killed as well as the number of those injured in the reporting period were both lower than they had been in each of the preceding quarters in 2016. During the fourth quarter, four Palestinian boys were killed, and 81 Palestinian children were injured (5 girls and 76 boys); no Israeli children were killed and four Israeli children (4 boys) were injured. During the third quarter, six Palestinian boys had been killed and 190 children (187 Palestinian and 3 Israeli) injured.  

Additionally, one health related incident was documented in the West Bank. Nine-hundred and eighteen (918) cases of denial and delayed access to health were documented in the Gaza Strip following the application of stricter criteria by Israeli authorities, compared to five-hundred and thirty four (534) cases in the third quarter. Restrictions of access imposed by the Egyptian authorities remain ongoing.  

Available data indicates that the number of Palestinian children held in detention on security grounds remained high and continued to include cases of administrative detention.",267,"English"
2390104,"Carter Center Post-Election Statement: International Election Observation Mission to Nepal’s 2017 Provincial and Federal Elections, Dec. 21, 2017 **Carter Center Issues Statement on Nepal’s Counting Process**

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
Contact: In Atlanta, Soyia Ellison, soyia.ellison@cartercenter.org

KATHMANDU — The Carter Center today issued a post-election statement detailing its findings related to Nepal’s vote-counting process.

These findings remain preliminary, pending the announcement of election results and the resolution of any disputes. A final report that includes recommendations to help strengthen the conduct of future elections in Nepal will be published in early 2018.

During the counting, Carter Center observer teams were present in 27 districts throughout Nepal, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 districts. In its statement, The Carter Center noted that in the counting centers where observers had sufficient access, counting took place in a manner that was generally consistent with international standards, despite widespread deviations from established procedures. However, a considerable number of counting centers restricted Carter Center observers’ access, limiting the transparency of the process.

The decision to hold the elections in two phases meant that ballot boxes from Phase 1 needed to be stored for 10 days before being opened, creating the risk of ballot-tampering. But in Phase 1 districts where Carter Center observers were present, ballot boxes were safely secured and were under the close scrutiny of political party agents. Carter Center observers reported no incidents related to the storage of Phase 1 ballot boxes.

After Phase 1 polling, the Election Commission of Nepal issued directives outlining official counting instructions. These were widely ignored, however, as most returning officers chose instead to work with political party agents to reach consensus on vote-counting procedures. In counting centers where Carter Center observers were present, the deviations from the directives were intended to increase efficiency and avoid possible grievances and did not compromise the integrity of the count. While these local-level agreements ensured overall acceptance of the process and results, they also led to inconsistencies, particularly regarding the determination of the validity of ballots.

Party and candidate agents were consistently present in the counting centers and followed the process closely. Party agents did not make substantive complaints about the conduct of counting in the centers where Carter Center observers were present.

Sixteen of the 27 districts in which Carter Center observers were present provided full access to observers. The other 11 restricted access to varying degrees. Limiting observer access to this crucial aspect of the process is contrary to international standards, to the expressed intent of the ECN directives, and to the terms of observer accreditation. The presence of observers is integral to ensuring the transparency and integrity of an election, and provisions should always be in place to allow them adequate access.

2390054,"SMS tool brings sexual, reproductive health information to Rwanda’s youth KIGALI, Rwanda – Rwanda’s health system has seen great improvements in recent years, yet one area of health care remains underserved, particularly for young people: sexual and reproductive health.

Stigma and embarrassment keep young people from learning about their bodies, health and rights.

To address this need, UNFPA, the Ministry of Health, Imbuto Foundation and other partners recently released Mobile for Reproductive Health – or M4RH – an interactive messaging system that reaches mobile phone users with information about puberty, preventing sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy, and where to find health services.

“M4RH has helped me understand the importance of abstaining from sex, but also the proper use of condoms,” said Nyiransengiyumva Odette, 23, an early user of the mobile phone programme.

She added that much of the information provided is not readily available to young people.

**Reaching those in need**

Lack of information about sexual and reproductive health takes a serious toll.

According to a 2014 national survey, 7 per cent of Rwandan girls aged 15 to 19 were pregnant or already mothers. Nearly one in five women would like to prevent or delay pregnancy but have an unmet need for family planning.

Mobile phones offer an avenue for experts to reach youth with accurate information on these topics in a private, nonjudgmental way. Over 60 per cent of households in Rwanda own a mobile phone.

Because most young people do not have smart phones, M4RH does not require internet access. Instead, it uses short message service (SMS).

“For information about puberty, reply 10. For sex and pregnancy, reply 20. HIV 30. STIs 40. Pregnancy prevention methods 50. Stories about young people 70. And the youth-friendly services directory 80,” said one of the first SMS messages.

“The messages are of benefit to me, but also to my younger sister as well. When I get an M4RH message, I share the information with her,” said Ms. Nyiransengiyumva. “It is a great way to sensitize younger youth.”

**Addressing gender-based violence**

The programme also allows health experts to addresses related concerns, such as gender-based violence.

In the 2014 survey, 41 per cent of Rwandan women said wife beating can be justified. Twenty-nine per cent believed physical abuse is justified when a woman refuses to have sex with a man. 

“In a healthy relationship, sex should never be pressured, forced, or traded,” M4RH explains in its text messages. “Young people who decide to have sex should use condoms as well as other pregnancy prevention methods to avoid pregnancy and HIV/ STI infection. Having sex will not make you mature faster.”

Rape “is always wrong and the rape survivor is never guilty,” another message states, encouraging survivors of violence to seek assistance.

**Gaining in popularity**

Telecommunications companies in Rwanda joined the partnership to launch M4RH, ensuring the programme works on all carriers and without charge.

The Ministry of Health developed the content and provided the messages in Kinyarwanda, one of the country’s official languages. UNFPA also helped to develop the content, ensuring the messages were suitable for a young audience. The Imbuto Foundation also provided support.

The programme was launched in October in the western district of Rubavu. District officials and partners brought together youth to subscribe to the programme, test it out, and receive sexual and reproductive health services including HIV tests, hepatitis screenings and free condoms.

M4RH has quickly gained popularity. In September, over 100,000 people registered for it.

In the coming months, developers hope to expand on the tool, reaching other age groups, and adding an ability to provide reliable, factual responses to direct questions from users.",267,"English"

2390024,"North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, November 2017 **Operational Overview**

The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains severe due to ongoing conflict, continued internal displacement and the unpredictable return of refugees from neighbouring countries. New population movements continued to be recorded in November, with 1,862 new arrivals in Gwoza, followed by 729 in Askira/Uba, 428 in Mafa, 373 in Ngala and 358 in Madagali; Jere and Chibok recorded relatively high numbers of departures. Additionally, recent important and unexpected arrivals of population (over 13,000 persons) were recorded in Nganzai, Konduga and Magumeri where there is very limited partner presence due to insecurity and lack of access. Humanitarian agencies mobilised to address to the most urgent needs, in particular through the rapid response mechanism (RRM), filling the most pressing gaps until sectors can plan and deliver a comprehensive response.  

While food security has improved throughout the north-east in 2017 as a result of a massive scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihoods assistance, the situation remains extremely fragile with many households, particularly in Borno State, mainly dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic food and livelihood needs. Many remain forced to resort to negative coping strategies to access food. The most recent Cadre Harmonisé analysis (finalised in November) projects that, without adequate and timely humanitarian assistance, 3.7 million individuals will be facing critical levels of food insecurity during the 2018 lean season (June through September). The figure does not include four Borno State local government areas (LGAs) where data could not be collected due to access constraints (in Abadam, Guzamala and Marte) or lack of partner capacity (in Kala/Balge).  

In addition to food insecurity, issues of protection continue to cause extremely serious concern throughout the north-east, including person-borne explosive device attacks in or near IDP camps, and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) of internally displaced persons (IDPs) by those supposed to protect them, as was reported in Bama (Borno State). In addition, on 1 November, four pupils in a primary school in Kwaya Kusar, Borno State, were gruesomely attacked. Two of them died and the other two were severely wounded. This direct attack against an educational institution, the first one in two years, may impact school attendance as parents may fear for their children’s lives. In addition, following the resurgence of attacks by non-state armed groups in some parts of Adamawa State, 12 primary schools have been closed, affecting education continuity for the children enrolled in those schools.  

The dry season has also allowed the work on ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs to accelerate and, to date, five out of the nine planned hubs are complete (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza). Another four (Monguno, Damasak, Banki and Rann) are expected to be fully operational by early 2018. As these hubs offer secure accommodation and Internet connectivity for aid workers, they are instrumental in supporting effective last-mile aid delivery and enhancing local coordination.  

With close to 70 per cent (US$731 million out of $1.05 billion) of the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) funding requirements received before year-end, the humanitarian response in Nigeria is one of the world’s best funded. Thanks to the generous support of donors, many sectors have been able to meet their targets on key life-saving activities. However, a critical gap remained throughout the year in the funding of the Response and Recovery Planning sector. This has hampered the humanitarian agencies’ ability to deliver comprehensive livelihood support to affected people, has slowed down debris removal activities in major towns, and overall limited early recovery work across north-east Nigeria.  

As the year draws to a close, sectors and humanitarian organisations continued to carry out various programme-based and areabased needs assessments which are contributing to drafting the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan, to be finalised respectively by mid-December and early January.",267,"English"

2389979,"Kenya: Food Assistance Fact Sheet -  December 21, 2017 **Situation**

- Below-average rainfall during the 2016 rainy seasons and the 2017 March-to-May rainy season has led to severe drought and deteriorating food security and nutrition conditions in northern and southeastern parts of Kenya. The 2017 October-to-December rainy season has been above average across most of the country, leading to slight improvements in water and pasture availability for livestock. As a result, food security in some pastoral households is improving to Stressed (IPC 2) levels. However, staple food prices remain high after several consecutive below-average harvests, and the majority of poor pastoral households will likely continue to face Crisis (IPC 3) levels of acute food insecurity through January 2018, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).

- High levels of malnutrition persist, with approximately 370,000 children younger than five years of age and 37,000 pregnant and lactating women experiencing acute malnutrition.

- According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Kenya hosts more than 489,000 refugees. As of October 2017, Kenya hosted more than 286,500 Somalis and 111,000 South Sudanese fleeing conflict and food insecurity in their own countries. While the number of Somali refugees has decreased since 2016 due to repatriations, the number of South Sudanese has increased as insecurity worsens in South Sudan.

**Response**

- The USAID Office of Food for Peace (FFP) partners with the UN World Food Program (WFP) to provide relief and build resilience among the most vulnerable populations in Kenya. In the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) counties, FFP supports food-insecure Kenyans by providing cash transfers or food in exchange for work on improving community assets, such as rehabilitating local roads or irrigation systems. FFP also provides funding and in-kind, ready-to-use therapeutic foods to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in the ASALs and among refugee populations in Kenya. FFP provided support to WFP for contingency planning for possible violence and displacement associated with the 2017 Kenyan general elections, as well as supplementary nutritious foods for children younger than five years of age and pregnant and lactating women in areas with the highest levels of acute malnutrition.

- FFP supports refugees living in the Dadaab and Kakuma camps, and their host communities, through direct food distributions, education on maternal and child health, livelihoods training, and supplementary and therapeutic nutritious food. FFP also supports WFP’s refugee operation by providing cash-based transfers for food, support for local procurement of cereals and pulses, and a pilot program to develop refugee-managed milling operations.",267,"English"
2389974,"Orphaned Rohingya children forced to grow up too fast *In Bangladesh, thousands of teenaged refugees are now caring for their younger siblings and relatives after losing their families in Myanmar violence.*

By Mohammed Abu Asaker in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh  |  22 December 2017

**At just 18, Rabiaa is newly orphaned and a “mother” of two.**

Her parents died when their village in Myanmar’s Buthidaung township was razed a few months ago. In the chaos, she was separated from her four siblings and found her two nieces, aged four and nine, in distress on the side of the road. They sought refuge in a local village for a month before crossing to Bangladesh.

“It was a tough journey,” said Rabiaa, recalling the 25-day walk with nothing but the clothes on their backs. “My nieces were crying the whole time, missing their parents and little brothers.”

They arrived at a transit centre run by UNHCR, a first stop for new arrivals in Bangladesh, and were given hot meals, clean water and new clothes. A week later, they moved to Kutupalong camp where they now live beside their former neighbour from Myanmar.

“Since we all lost our parents, I am now playing the role of a mother and they are like my little children,” said Rabiaa of the two girls. “I will take care of them for the rest of my life, even if it means that I don’t get married. I want to see them well-educated.”

Rabiaa’s predicament is sadly far too common in the refugee camps and settlements of Cox’s Bazar, where some 650,000 refugees have arrived after fleeing violence that erupted in Myanmar in late August.

The UN Refugee Agency believes that children make up 55 percent of the total refugee population. Thousands have fled without the protection of their family or community and become caregivers to younger siblings or other children overnight. According to the current family counting exercise, some 5,600 families are headed by children under 18 years of age.

Jainab Bibi, 14, is still mourning her mother’s death during the journey to Bangladesh two months ago. “We covered her body with a blanket and left,” she said, crying. “I miss her very much.”

As well as coping with that loss, she also has to care for her eight-year-old brother. Fortunately, they are now living with a former neighbour who was a good friend of their mother’s.

“We never think of children as lonely. But here, I met some of the loneliest children who now have to adopt an adult role taking care of their own siblings,” said Louise Aubin, UNHCR’s senior emergency coordinator in Cox’s Bazar.

UNHCR and partner organizations are identifying families headed by children, as well as children who are alone or unaccompanied, for individual follow-up to assess their situation.

UNHCR and others involved in child protection are setting up sustainable foster care arrangements within the refugee communities to ensure that these refugee children are safe and properly supported. More child-friendly spaces and education facilities are being established to help ease the pressures on children forced into adult roles.

These roles can be hard to shake off. Aisha has been playing “mum” since she was seven years old. Her parents died of tuberculosis in Myanmar 10 years ago, leaving her to care for three younger siblings. They fled to Bangladesh in October, where Aisha takes care of the shelter while her two brothers and a sister look for work, collect firewood or attend the madrassa, or Islamic school.

She frets that she cannot give them everything they need, and still imagines a life in which her parents are still alive – a life where she could marry and worry less about the little ones’ future.

But the daydream wears off as she remembers her responsibilities: “I want to make sure they are well educated. If they get high marks, I will feel like I raised them well.”

2389939,"ACAPS Briefing Note – Yemen: Diphtheria outbreak, Briefing note – 22 December 2017 **Crisis Overview**

312 suspected cases of diphtheria have been reported in Yemen between mid-August and 20 December. The outbreak has resulted in 35 deaths reported. At 11%, the case fatality rate (CFR) is high. 18 out of Yemen’s 22 governorates are affected, with Ibb having the majority of cases. Children aged 5-14 account for around 50% of suspected cases. About 90% of fatalities were reported in children aged less than 15.

**Crisis Impact**

Crisis impact 312 cases of suspected diphtheria were reported in Yemen between mid-August and 20 December. However, the exact number of cases might differ, as duplicate reporting can occur and many cases may go unreported as the disease continues to spread. 35 deaths were declared as of 20 December. Case fatality rate (CFR) has risen to 11.2% from 8,5% in November. (WHO December 2017 WHO 19/11/2017) 56% of all cases have been reported in Ibb governorate but the outbreak is widespread, with cases in 18 out of 22 governorates and 78 districts are affected in total. (For more detailed information, see map on page 5) Children aged 5-14 account for around 50% of suspected cases. About 90% of fatalities were reported in children aged less than 15. (WHO December 2017) Diphtheria is endemic in Yemen. However, this is the biggest outbreak since 1989. In recent years the cases have been sporadic, with 27 cases reported across the country in 2016. (WHO 19/11/2017) 

Health: Yemen’s health system is severely affected by conflict, import restrictions on medicines and supplies, collapsing infrastructure, and critical shortages of health staff. It is heavily dependent on
foreign aid. The quality of health services in treatment facilities is poor: infection prevention and control is poor, and partners have exhausted their capacities. Most health facilities do not have laboratory capacity to confirm the presence of C. diphtheriae, and therefore the diagnosis and treatment of the disease is difficult. Low vaccination rates and lack of access to medical care exacerbate the crisis. (Reuters 13/12/2017) Food: Most of the governorates affected by the outbreak currently face at least IPC 3 (Crisis) food security outcomes with Sa’ada, Hajjah, Taizz, and Abyan at risk of IPC 4 (Emergency) in 2018. (FEWSNET)

Nutrition: Areas affected by the outbreak – including Abyan, Al Hudaydah, Lahj, Hadramaut, and Taizz – face global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates above 15% (Nutrition Cluster 3/09/2017). 400,000 children in Yemen are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, particularly in Al Hudaydah.

2389899,"UNHCR steps up aid as displaced Syrians brace for winter *Plans in place to help protect 3.8 million vulnerable individuals from harsh weather this winter, but programme currently only 63 per cent funded.*

**Sitting in the single, unheated room that serves as their home in a run-down neighbourhood of the Lebanese capital Beirut, Samira and her husband Hussein have a familiar sense of foreboding at the prospect of their sixth winter in exile since fleeing the conflict in neighbouring Syria.**

Like the majority of the roughly one million registered Syrian refugees living in Lebanon, the couple – originally from Deir Ez-Zour – have good reason to fear the arrival of colder temperatures and winter storms. Already struggling to cover their rent, food and medical expenses, they are ill-prepared for the harsh conditions and additional costs that winter brings.

Their main concern is for the welfare of their two-year-old son Haytham, who suffers from asthma and for whom the cold weather and heightened risk of infection pose a real threat.

“He’s had asthma since birth. When it gets bad his breathing becomes heavy and his face turns blue, and we have to give him oxygen or take him to the hospital,” Samira, 30, explains. “If he gets sick with the flu, his condition intensifies and then he can barely take a breath.”

It is a similar picture across the country, where tens of thousands of Syrian refugees live in flimsy structures made of wood and plastic sheeting in informal settlements. Flooded shelters are a familiar sight in Lebanon’s mountainous areas during winter, which also brings heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures to many areas.

To help vulnerable refugees prepare for the cold temperatures, from November UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, began providing winter cash assistance of between US$225-375 to help with additional costs such as fuel, clothing and medical expenses. So far around 650,000 people have received such payments out of a planned total of 800,000.

Samira and her family, who are among the beneficiaries of the scheme, say the extra support will help keep them warm in the coming months. “For sure it will be of assistance,” she said. “For heating for example, especially with the harsh weather here, it will be of great help in dealing with my son’s condition.”

Across the region as a whole, UNHCR aims to assist a total of 3.81 million Syrian and Iraqi refugees and internally displaced people with its winter assistance programme in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.

The programme targets the most vulnerable families with a mixture of cash assistance, building materials to repair and weather-proof shelters, and distributions of winter items including high thermal blankets, gas heaters and warm clothes.

It also includes plans to assist more than 1.1 million individuals displaced inside Syria, with priority given to those most recently displaced and others living in hard-to-reach or besieged areas.

Of the total US$228 million requested to finance this year’s winter programme, donations so far received amount to US$143 million - leaving a shortfall of around 37 per cent still needed to provide assistance to more than a million people.

Meanwhile, the approaching winter is also threatening the safety and welfare of refugees in other areas of the Mediterranean, including Greece, which was transited by more than 1 million people at the height of Europe’s refugee crisis.

UNHCR has been urging the Greek government to accelerate winter preparations for thousands of refugees and migrants in the main reception islands of Lesvos, Chios and Samos, warning of a possible repeat of the winter of 2016/17, with hundreds braving conditions in small tents and makeshift shelter.

UNHCR has also helped directly by more than 240,000 aid items to authorities to be used on the islands, including tents and winter clothing, and continues to support the transfer of people to the mainland to avoid winter spent in unheated tents with poor facilities.

Almost 20,000 have come to the islands since July. Most are from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and include many families with young children, and other vulnerable people in need of dignified accommodation and conditions. .

**South Sudan: Aid agencies appeal for $1.72 billion to assist 6 million people amidst rising needs**

The humanitarian community in South Sudan has launched an appeal for US$1.72 billion to provide critical and life-saving assistance to 6 million people affected by conflict, displacement, hunger and a deteriorating economy. “There is a growing need for humanitarian assistance with displacement, food insecurity, malnutrition, violence and economic decline taking a toll on the health, safety and livelihoods of people in need,” said Alain Noudéhou, the Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan. “We are calling for US$1.72 billion to continue providing life-saving assistance and protection for 6 million people most in need in South Sudan.” Mr. Noudéhou emphasized the centrality of protection of vulnerable groups, especially women and children, in the response plan. Since the conflict began in December 2013, about 4 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including 1.9 million people who have been internally displaced and about 2.1 million who have fled as refugees to neighbouring countries.  

As the conflict continues in some parts of the country, rates of hunger and malnutrition have risen, and food security partners report the risk of famine for the most vulnerable, if early actions are not taken.  
According to the South Sudan Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an earlier than normal start of the lean season will result in an estimated 5.1 million people (48 per cent of the total population) being classified as severely food insecure between January-March 2018.",267,"English"
2389799,"Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in the Near East and North Africa **Conflict causing spikes in food insecurity in the Near East and North Africa**

*Strife and violence in some countries are casting a shadow on prospects for Zero Hunger across the entire region*

21 December 2017, Cairo/Rome – Conflict and protracted crises in a handful of countries in the Near East and North Africa are hamstringing efforts to eradicate hunger in the region by 2030, according to a new FAO report published today.

The 2017 edition of the Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) highlights in particular how an ongoing intensification of violence is opening a wide ""hunger gap"" between countries being affected by conflicts and those that are not.

In NENA countries directly impacted by conflict, 27.2 percent of all people were chronically hungry – or undernourished – during the 2014-16 period. That's six times higher than the share of the population that was undernourished in countries not affected by strife (4.6 percent, on average). Meanwhile, ""severe food insecurity"" – another metric used by FAO to measure hunger – in conflict-affected countries now is double that in non-conflict countries.

These trends are casting a dark shadow on the broader NENA region's ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger by 2030, today's report warns. (Full list of NENA countries below)

In a region largely made up of developing, middle-income countries – where chronic hunger typically affects less than 5 percent of their populations – violence in an unfortunate few has seen the proportion of chronically hungry people in conflict zones shoot up to levels comparable with the world's poorest countries, which is exercising a strong drag effect on hunger reduction in the full NENA area.

This will make realistic progress towards eradicating hunger in the region using traditional tools of policymaking difficult, unless decisive steps towards peace and stability are taken, the report cautions.

**Hot spots**

The report highlights several NENA countries being particularly affected by conflict, with profound consequences for people's incomes and food security.

In Syria, violence has provoked a 67 percent reduction in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and severely undermined food security – from 70 to 80 percent of Syrians now need humanitarian assistance, while 50 percent require food assistance.

In Iraq, where violence has led to for 58 percent decline in GDP, 30 percent of the population needs humanitarian assistance while 9 percent requires food assistance.

Yemen is also being wracked by conflict, leading to a situation in which 70 to 80 of the population are in need humanitarian assistance and 50 percent require food assistance.

Libya is another hot spot where conflict is undermining food security; there, 6 percent of the population are in need of food assistance, according to the report.

**Building resilience in trying times**

Speaking at the report's Cairo launch, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative, Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, highlighted the pivotal importance of building resilience and sustaining peace in the Near East and North Africa region to improving peoples' well-being.

He pointed to ""the growing need to implement long-term and comprehensive policies and practices to achieve Zero hunger by 2030,"" adding that that ""when countries in the region are suffering from an escalation of conflicts, the aim to tackle the region's deepest concerns of malnutrition, water scarcity and climate change becomes more challenging but at the same time more urgent"".

""Only through improved cooperation and solidarity will the region be able to end conflicts and violence and get back to development,"" Ould Ahmed concluded.

Today's report establishes a baseline for measuring future progress towards achieving SDG 2 in the NENA region using the latest indicators for the SDG targets on hunger and food insecurity (Target 2.1) and malnutrition (Target 2.2).

The report also identifies how conflict itself encumbers SDG monitoring. UN agencies gather and assess information on food security and nutrition status during conflict, but the data are not always complete and can be difficult to compare with peacetime data.

Beyond statistics, the report focuses on the fundamental factors that have driven improvements in food security and malnutrition: poverty reduction, economic growth, improvements in maternal and childhood nutrition and public health, increases in the quantity and quality of food and the cessation of violence.

2389794,"For remote Vanuatu islanders, fleeing climate disasters is an uphill battle by Lin Taylor | @linnytayls | Thomson Reuters Foundation

**Village chief Steve Bob is determined to move his 200 residents to higher ground as sea levels threaten their homes**

SOUTH RIVER, Vanuatu, Dec 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Villagers in South River, a palm-fringed coastal community in the low-lying South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, are used to battling cyclones, floods and tsunamis but are now facing a new threat - rising seas.

Worldwide, seas have risen 26 cm (10 inches) since the late 19th century, driven by melting ice and the expansion of water warmed by climate change, United Nations data shows, and scientists predict a rise of another metre or more by 2100.

With the risk that rising seas could eventually swamp South River on Erromango island, village chief Steve Bob is determined to move his 200 residents to higher ground but getting people to shift an hour's walk inland is proving to be an uphill battle.

Although the new land on offer is larger and at a site where their ancestors once lived, only one family has relocated since Bob proposed the idea a year ago.

""It's hard for me to convince everyone to move up. It's only when we're facing a flood or natural disaster that people are open to the idea,"" Bob said in Bislama through a translator to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""When there's nothing happening, everyone is less concerned about moving, and they don't worry about the potential danger that they can be in.""

Vanuatu, one of the world's poorest nations, is a sprawling cluster of more than 80 islands and around 270,000 people, 2,000 km (1,250 miles) northeast of the Australian city of Brisbane.

Perched on the geologically active ""Ring of Fire"", it suffers frequent earthquakes and tsunamis and has several active volcanoes in addition to threats from storms and rising seas.

It is also one of the nations most at risk from rising sea levels which menace coastal cities and communities around the world, with low-lying islands having the most to lose as most - or all - of their land could disappear beneath the waves.

Higher sea levels also aggravate the impact of worsening storms such as Cyclone Pam. In 2015, the category 5 cyclone devastated Vanuatu, including South River where palm-leaf thatched huts, cattle and boats were swept away.

""IT WON'T BE THE SAME""

Having lived through cyclones and floods, villager Stephanie Nonokinas knows how deadly climate change-related disasters can be but the 23-year-old said young people did not want to move.

""It's sad and it will be hard for us to live up there because we grew up here, we were born and bred here. It won't be the same anymore,"" she said.

For Freddy Sei, 15, being able to swim in the river, canoe in the sea, and fish with his friends on a whim, are a few of the things he would miss if families move uphill.

Last year, 24 million people globally fled at least temporarily to another area of their country because of a storm, flood, wildfire or other natural disaster, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), part of aid agency Norwegian Refugee Council.

Natural disasters displaced three times as many people as conflicts in 2016, according to IDMC data, and migration experts warn displacement around the world as a result of unchecked climate change could eventually dwarf other migration flows.

A 2015 global climate pact promised to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, with an ambition of limiting temperature rises even further to 1.5 degrees - a level seen as key to protect low-lying islands.

Currently, however, the world is on track toward a 3 degree rise in temperature - though the 2015 Paris climate deal includes a mechanism to boost action and try to bring that down.

Pacific islanders say they are clearly seeing the impacts of that warming already.

""Sea level rise is increasing, which causes a lot of changes along coastlines in the Pacific region. I'm concerned that more villages have to relocate,"" said Isaac Savua, head of operations in Vanuatu for aid agency CARE International.

Seline Bob, the South River chief's wife, is worried too.

""Sometimes the sun is too strong, and sometimes it rains too much. I fear that there's going to be another cyclone, maybe the same category as Pam, or worse,"" she said.

But the lack of drinking water up the hill has kept her from embracing her husband's idea to relocate.

""Once the water is sorted out, I would fully agree to move up because this place is becoming a danger zone,"" she said, cradling a grandchild as a dog slept in the shade and chickens roamed by.

It may not be a popular decision but village chief Bob said remaining in a disaster-prone area is a risk he is no longer willing to take. He said he has started building new houses up the hill and is even planning for a church.

""We've all grown attached to this place. It's hard to move everything and go up to a new place and start a new home again,"" he said.

""But (last year's) flood nearly submerged the whole community, which is why I'm taking a stand that we should move to higher ground.""",267,"English"
2389744,"Targeting vulnerable households for humanitarian cash transfers **Executive summary**

This case study details the experiences of the emergency cash-based response to droughts in southern Zimbabwe from 2015 to 2017. CARE International in partnership with World Vision International (WVI) implemented a Department for International Development (DFID)-funded programme ‘Emergency Cash First Response to Drought-Affected Communities in the Southern Provinces of Zimbabwe’ from August 2015 to May 2017. It was the largest ever multi-purpose unconditional cash transfer programme in Zimbabwe. The programme aimed to meet the immediate food needs of households who were affected by the 2015 and 2016 droughts.  

As with all humanitarian programmes, financial resources for this emergency response were finite. A critical element of cash-based programming is to ensure that a sufficient transfer value is distributed to households, in order for the intervention to be effective in meeting their immediate food needs. Therefore, a prioritisation process must take place, according to the needs of households, to channel resources to the most vulnerable. This underlines the importance of an effective targeting process.  
The key challenge in targeting is how to establish who is most vulnerable. The factors determining this are contextspecific and require local knowledge. For this reason, the Zimbabwe cash transfer programme used a multi-stage, community-based approach to targeting.  

This case study evaluates the cash transfer programme’s overall targeting process, from the macro, provincial level, to the micro, household level. It explains the targeting process, highlights successes and challenges faced and incorporates recommendations for future cash transfer programmes.  
The key conclusions based on the experiences of targeting in this programme are as follows:

• Good targeting does not happen easily or without costs: sufficient resources must be allocated to the overall targeting process, including verification and registration. With a large-scale programme, those resources are required throughout most of the programme’s life, and not just in the first month or two, although the need will be less intensive as time goes on. Investing time and money into the targeting, registration and verification processes will pay dividends in the long run by helping to ensure a more effective programme which truly targets those most in need of assistance.

• Use a participatory, community-based approach to targeting at the local level. This should include good communication, facilitation and the active participation of targeted communities. This gives affected communities the opportunity to actively have a say on who will be targeted and prioritised for assistance, empowering them to take decisions into their own hands.

• Complement this community-led approach with a robust verification process to validate the data and ensure that those households which are objectively most in need according to the vulnerability criteria are indeed the ones being selected by the community.

• Collect as much data as possible on the food security and vulnerability of communities in the programme regions to corroborate the targeting data and ensure robust results.",267,"English"
2389669,"IOM, Italy Broaden Stabilization Efforts for Conflict-Affected Communities in Iraq [EN/AR] Iraq – After the end of the successful first phase of the IOM Iraq - Italian Government partnership to strengthen community stabilization initiatives in Diyala Governorate (between August 2016 to November 2017), a new project has been launched to support the psychosocial well-being of vulnerable displaced women in Dohuk and Ninewa governorates.

Funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), the one-year project, with a budget of half a million euros, will enable IOM Iraq to empower vulnerable women who have been affected by conflict, including through the provision of livelihood support. 

The project will aim to involve 1,000 women, including from ethno-religious minorities; especially Yazidis –considered one of the most vulnerable communities of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq. 

The Yazidi community is mostly concentrated in northern Iraq. Its members, especially women, went through ordeals when ISIL swept into their areas, beginning in 2014 and seized large swathes of territory, killing and enslaving thousands of Yazidis.

“The active participation of women is essential to reach sustainable peace and community stabilization. This livelihood training will assist vulnerable women to strengthen their skills and allow them to support themselves and their families. We are pleased to provide support, especially during this time of transition, as families continue to recover from devastating conflict,” said Bruno Antonio Pasquino, Italian Ambassador to Iraq. 

“Gender and minorities are the two traditional focal points of the Italian activities in the field of development cooperation,” Ambassador Pasquino added. 

In addition to individual livelihood support for women, the project will provide a dozen grassroots local civil society organizations (CSOs) with training and follow-up coaching to address the essential psychosocial needs of community members, in partnership with Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government authorities including the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Health.

The training courses will cover a broad range of topics such as psychosocial support and social cohesion, enhancing CSOs management and networking skills, as well as providing beneficiaries with entrepreneurial livelihood support by creating self-help groups to improve interactions, social cohesion, and confidence among them. 

“Engaging local CSOs will enable us to transfer the experience we gained over the last three years in providing psychosocial support in emergency contexts, and prepare the community-based partners to take the lead in providing psychosocial services,” said Renato Libanora of IOM Iraq’s psychosocial support team.  
The project in Dohuk and Ninewa builds on the similar recently completed project that IOM implemented in Diyala, in partnership with AICS.

Khalida Nouri of Khanaqin, one of Diyala project’s participants, says that the project economically empowered dozens of women by teaching them sewing skills. 

“About 44 women participated in the course I taught; they were mostly displaced from their homes, and included Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen,” she said. 

“The course’s contents and the interaction among us made me more confident. I learned many things; since taking this course I have become more self-sufficient. I also had an opportunity to learn about other people’s traditions and lifestyles,” Nouri said. 

Nouri added that she is still in contact with a number of participants who opened small sewing businesses, either at home or in shops, thanks to the skills they learned in the course. Nouri said that there are now nearly 500 applicants who want to enroll in this course to be able to help themselves and their families.

According to the latest Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) figures, since January 2014, more than 2.9 million Iraqis are still displaced This includes 941,000 in Ninewa 360,000 in Dohuk and nearly 83,000 in Diyala governorate. More than 2.7 million of formerly displaced Iraqis have returned to their place of origin.

2389629,"IOM Supports Voluntary Humanitarian Return of 89 Comorian Migrants from Libya Moroni – A flight chartered by IOM, the UN Migration Agency in Libya, arrived yesterday (21/12) at the Moroni Hahaya International airport, Comoros, carrying 89 Comorian migrants, including 30 women and one unaccompanied child. Among the returnees were two medical cases that received immediate attention for medical follow up.

The returnees were welcomed by representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Health, Social Affairs, and by a delegation of IOM headed by Daniel Silva y Poveda, IOM Chief of Mission to Madagascar, Comoros and the Seychelles.

Upon their arrival, returnees were provided with immediate assistance by government stakeholders, and each returnee received pocket money (EUR 50) from IOM, to cover their immediate needs. Buses were arranged by the Government of Comoros to transport the returnees to their villages of origin. Within the next two months, IOM will assess the returnees’ situation on a case by case basis to help them find alternatives to ensure their sustainable reintegration in the Comoros.

Most of the stranded migrants were held in detention centres in the Tripoli region, Libya. Once they agreed to return, IOM conducted pre-departure interviews, medical examinations, and the Comorian Embassy in Tripoli facilitated the acquisition of travel documents and issuance of exit visas for all passengers.

As of 19 December, IOM had assisted 17,744 voluntary humanitarian returns from Libya in 2017. With the agreement reached at last month’s EU-AU Summit in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, IOM has assisted 4,258 individuals through its expanded humanitarian returns programme, addressing acute vulnerabilities and working closely with consular officials from countries of origin. This is the first flight to the Western Indian Ocean region.

The returns and reintegration assistance are funded by the EUTF-IOM joint initiative for migrant protection and reintegration. As part of this project, IOM Comoros will support returnees, depending on their profiles and needs, to establish small businesses, as an individual or within a group, or to enroll them in vocational trainings.

2389624,"Setting Standards for an Integrated Approach to Reintegration Geneva – IOM, the UN Migration Agency, published today (22/12) the report Setting Standards for an Integrated Approach to Reintegration. The report, prepared and conducted by the Samuel Hall think tank, outlines recommendations to support sustainable reintegration of migrants who return to their home countries in the framework of Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) programmes.

The research presented in this report was conducted under the Mediterranean Sustainable Reintegration (MEASURE) Project, funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and managed by the Migrant Assistance Division at IOM Headquarters. MEASURE aimed to foster the sustainability of reintegration interventions through the completion of desk and field research in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Senegal and Somalia.

This research resulted in a broad set of recommendations to improve reintegration programming. “The report is an important step in connecting the dots in the field of reintegration to build on the existing expertise in different thematic areas: for instance, mental health and psychosocial support, community-based initiatives or partnerships for the creation of jobs and economic opportunities at the local level,” said Nazanine Nozarian, MEASURE Project Manager. “Efforts need to be made to adapt such practice under AVRR programmes and promote their implementation in a systematic and consistent manner,” she added.

The research also led to the development of a set of 15 field-tested indicators relating to the economic, social and psychosocial dimensions of reintegration, which are presented in the report together with a reintegration scoring system, allowing to measure post-return outcomes and to facilitate the understanding of returnees’ progress towards sustainability. These tools will allow IOM and other practitioners to compare trends in returnees’ reintegration across countries and over time.

“IOM is already taking concrete steps to implement the results of the MEASURE project. For instance, the indicators will be used by IOM within EU-funded migrant protection and reintegration initiatives in Africa and in Asia, to foster comparative analysis across regions and countries, and promote evidence-based programming,” added Nozarian. 

“Return is never easy nor straightforward. MEASURE findings confirm that reintegration is a complex, multifaceted process, one that not only concerns returnees but also their peers and communities. It is not simply a logistical or economic process, it also requires social and psychosocial support for returnees to feel empowered,” said Nassim Majidi, Co-Director of Samuel Hall. “Implementing the report’s recommendations will require innovative thinking and flexibility from donors and practitioners who will need to invest more time and energy to support each returnee,” highlighted Majidi.

2389604,"DTM South Sudan: Pulchuol, Jonglei State Intentions Survey and Multi-Sectorial Needs Assessment | December 2017 **INTRODUCTION**

IOM’s DTM and NFI teams carried out an intenons survey and multi-sectoral needs assessment from 25 October to 1 November 2017 in Pulchuol, Jonglei State.

**CONTEXT**

Pulchuol is a payam located in the center of the Uror County (Jonglei State). Uror borders with Motoot in the Northeast, Pathai in the West, and Karam and Pieri in the East. Pulchuol Payam includes the four bomas Duol, Rupliah, Patuak and Nyakhor, which were assessed during this DTM exercise.

Between the end of March and early April of this year, conflict took place in Yuai, displacing its population which moved towards Pulchuol. As conflict also took place in Waat, people avoided that area and stayed in Pulchuol or moved to other locations, such as Akobo and east of Waat.",267,"English"
2389594,"Over 350 Nepali Migrant Workers Assisted by Qatar Development Fund in Past Two Years: IOM Kathmandu – Over 350 vulnerable Nepalis, including victims of human trafficking, stranded and irregular migrant workers have been helped to return home from abroad over the past two years through a project implemented by the UN Migration Agency (IOM) and funded by the Qatar Development Fund (QDF).

The project: *‘Return Assistance to Stranded Nepali Migrants,’* which ends in January 2018, has provided voluntary return and reintegration assistance to destitute, undocumented Nepali migrants in situations of abuse and exploitation in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, UAE, Oman, Syria, Iraq and Malaysia.

It ensured that almost 90 percent of the returnees got direct assistance on arrival in Nepal, in coordination with a local partner NGOs. Aid included reception, temporary shelter support, psychosocial counselling, medical support, and tracing/reunification with family members.

Over 200 returnees also received a USD 500-equivalent reintegration package. Most used the money for income generation and livelihood support, spending it on their farms, buying livestock, or setting up a small business, like a grocery store, tea shop or tailor. The payment was designed to help them to sustainably reintegrate back into their local community. 

National stakeholders met in Kathmandu on 21 December at a consultation organized by IOM to discuss the outcomes of the project, best practices, challenges, and the way forward on return reintegration assistance for vulnerable Nepali migrants.

Over half of all Nepali households now have at least one migrant family member currently abroad or living in Nepal as a returnee, according to data from Nepal’s Department of Foreign Employment.

Many suffer abuse and over 6,800 complaints were registered between FY 2014/15 and FY 2016/17 by labour migrants against institutions or individuals regarding fraud and malpractice during their employment process. Over 400 rescue requests were received in FY 2016/17 by the Department of Consular Services.

“While the goal of IOM and its partners is to promote the benefits of migration and the dignity and rights of migrants, there is still a need to assist those who may have been exploited or otherwise stranded through circumstances beyond their own control,” IOM Nepal Chief of Mission Paul Norton told consultation participants. 

Noting that Qatar hosted an international conference on combatting human trafficking earlier this month (6-7/12), Qatari Ambassador to Nepal Yousuf Bin Mohammad Al-Hail said: “The State of Qatar spares no effort to support international efforts to combat human trafficking and related phenomena such as forced labour, modern day slavery and child labour. Qatar has established a National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking to unify efforts of government institutions and civil society and is satisfied with the formal adoption of the Political Declaration on implementation of the UN global plan to combat trafficking in persons.” 

“Qatar has also taken a number of measures, including issuing Law No. (15)/2011 on combatting human trafficking, which bans human trafficking in all its forms, Law No. (15)/2015 that abolishes the Kafala (sponsorship) system, and Law No. (15)/2017 regarding domestic workers,” he noted.  

“The Government of Nepal has always been concerned with the protection of rights and welfare of the Nepalese workers away from home,” said the Joint Secretary of Nepal’s Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) Bhuwan Acharya. “Our aim at global, regional and national levels is to make labour migration safe, managed, orderly, regular and dignified.” 

The QDF-backed project also organized an orientation programme for newly appointed Nepali Labour Attachés/Labour Counselors, including officials from the MoLE, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Women Children & Social Welfare, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Police Department.

The training aimed to strengthen their role in the identification of trafficking victims, referral, return, and reintegration mechanisms. Other trainings have included victim protection, referral mechanisms and shelter management for local NGOs and government officials.

The project, which was launched in September 2015, was implemented by the IOM, in close coordination with the MoLE, the MFA, diplomatic missions of host countries, Nepali embassies in destination countries, and consulates in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and elsewhere in the Middle East.

2389589,"DTM South Sudan: Pathai Payam, Intentions Survey and Multi-Sectorial Needs Assessment | December 2017 **INTRODUCTION**

IOM and Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH – present for NFI assessment) reached Pathai on 25 October. The team was welcomed by the Relief Organization For South Sudan (ROSS) and met with the Acting Executive Director in the absence of the Deputy Commissioner. The assessment dates were 26 October in Pathai Centre, 27 October in Turgay, 28 October in Modit and 30 October in Pabuong.  

**CONTEXT**

Pathai is a payam in Urur County of Jonglei State. It is about 120 minutes’ flight by helicopter from Bor. The host population is estimated at 14,796. The area also hosts more than 6,390 IDPs that fled conflict and hunger in Ayod,  

Pajul, Chuil, Uleng, and some locations in and around Waat of the former Greater Jonglei State and most IDPs arrived in the area between January and June 2017 bringing the total populaঞon to 21,186 individuals. There have been no reported cases of new arrival of IDPs in Pathai Payam since June. Apart from small scale fishing and farming, pastoralism is the most commonly pracঞced livelihood amongst the small population. The situation of the most vulnerable people including IDPs is precarious, with most surviving on sharing food with the host community, lile fish from nearby swamps and food distribuঞons from WFP around July 2017.  

Health and education faciliঞes are lacking. Only few pupils aend school, with some children being involved in cale herding, whilst others have joined armed groups. Most of the populaঞon including IDPs fetch drinking water from boreholes and contaminated water sources including stagnant ponds. Poor sanitaঞon is further exacerbated by the lack of latrines and the populaঞon pracঞcing open defecaঞon. In Pathai Centre there is a mobile clinic operated by MSF which is accessible for the community four ঞmes a month. The clinic also covers the nearest bomas including Modit, Pabuong, Turgay and Pulchuol. In the absence of other health faciliঞes in Pathai people with healthcare needs are reported to use local herbs in consultaঞon with local healers.  

According to the County Acting Commissioner, the front line between Pathai and Waat is about 12 hours’ walk from Pathai. Instances of inter-clan conflicts, cale rustling and revenge killings are reported as security concerns in the region.",267,"English"
2389584,"IOM Provides Assisted Voluntary Return Assistance to 68 Ethiopian Migrants from Hargeisa Hargeisa — IOM, the UN Migration Agency in collaboration with Somaliland’s Ministry of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Reconstruction, Hargeisa Migration Response Centre (MRC), the Ethiopian Community Centre in Hargeisa, the Ethiopian consulate in Somaliland, Somaliland’s Immigration Department and Somaliland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisted 68 vulnerable Ethiopian migrants to return home on 6 December 2017.

This Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) movement was supported by the Regional Mixed Migration Program funded by the US Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (BPRM).

After the 68 migrants were selected, IOM contacted the Ethiopian consulate in Hargeisa to carry out a nationality screening exercise and issue travel documents. The men, women and children were provided temporary shelter, food and onward transportation assistance to their final destinations upon arrival in Ethiopia. IOM missions in Hargeisa and Ethiopia worked together to verify their final destinations. The returnees were flown to Addis Ababa and received at the Bole International Airport by IOM Ethiopia on the same day.

“The IOM AVR programme is an indispensable part of a comprehensive approach to migration management aimed at orderly and humane return of migrants who are unable or unwilling to remain in host or transit countries and wish to return voluntarily to their countries of origin,” said Fesial Mohamud, a Project Officer with IOM Somalia’s Migrant Assistance Division.

There has been an increase in the number of Ethiopians deciding to return home in the recent past, according to the Hargeisa MRC database. The database also reveals that Ethiopian migrants who move to Hargeisa hoping to improve their economic status often opt to return home due to economic and social challenges.

Between January and November 2017, IOM Somalia through the Hargeisa Migration Response Centre (MRC) received over 230 applications for AVR from Ethiopians residing in Hargeisa. Many of the applicants were single mothers and the elderly who said that they would have found it difficult to make the trip home without support.

2389579,"Rohingya Arrivals in Bangladesh Hit 655,000 as Winter Weather Brings New Shelter, Health Challenges Cox’s Bazar - On Christmas day it will be four months since the start of the influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh. Latest figures show 655,000 people have arrived in that period, bringing the estimated total number of Rohingya in Cox’s Bazaar to 867,500.

IOM’s newly-released Needs and Population Monitoring (NPM) Round 7 assessed 1,635 locations hosting Rohingya refugees in collective sites and host communities. Key findings are that 73 percent of the refugees are living in new spontaneous settlements, 13 percent in makeshift settlements, 9 percent in host community locations and 5 percent in the formal refugee camps. Compared to the previous round, there has been a reduction in the proportion of refugees in host community locations and an increased proportion residing in collective sites.

As winter takes hold, IOM and its partners are scaling up their distribution of shelter and non-food items in response to the colder weather. In the past fortnight, distributions have included over 88,500 blankets and emergency shelter materials, including bamboo bundles for over 1,500 families. To date, IOM has distributed 124,000 tarpaulins, benefitting some 563,000 new arrivals. Some 32,000 people have also received other non-food relief items.

IOM is also supporting the Rohingya and the affected local population with water, hygiene and sanitation. Some 1,400 cubic metres of clean drinking water have been trucked into spontaneous settlements with limited access to water and over 68,000 people have received hygiene kits. Some 1,500 emergency latrines have been constructed to date, supporting 75,000 individuals. Some 29 deep tube wells have been completed and are functional.

To respond to an ongoing diphtheria outbreak, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and WHO, IOM is supporting a vaccination campaign for children under six, with community workers and support for vaccination teams on the ground. IOM has also constructed three 40-bed isolation and treatment centres to urgently increase case management and bed capacity and supporting contact tracing at several locations. 

As part of its ongoing response to gender-based violence (GBV) and to combat human trafficking, IOM and its partners are offering group support, including information about trafficking risks, and individual counselling sessions for female refugees in specially constructed safe spaces. Women and adolescent girls who visit the spaces can take part in recreational and psychosocial activities.

IOM social workers have already identified 14,340 extremely vulnerable individuals. Some 409 individuals who faced GBV have been assisted through IOM’s case management; 3,720 have received psychological first-aid; and 1,666 have been provided with health referrals.

IOM has also organized workshops run by counter trafficking experts for police and military working in Cox’s Bazar to raise awareness and sensitize them to cases of human trafficking.

2389564,"UN Migration Agency Launches Mobile Clinic for Stranded Migrants in Djibouti Djibouti – The Ministry of Health of Djibouti in collaboration with IOM, the UN Migration Agency’s office in Djibouti have launched a mobile patrol programme on 12 December 2017 to assist migrants in all five regions of the country.

This activity will help to provide medical screenings and treatment for stranded migrants along the migratory route. The mobile patrol programme is part of the Better Migration Management programme (BMM), which is funded by the European Union and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), and the Addressing Mixed Migration flows in Eastern Africa (AMMi) project funded by the European Union and Expertise France.

Djibouti’s Minister of the Interior, Hassan Omar Mohamed gave the opening address, “Djibouti is a land of asylum and destination for many vulnerable migrants but also a country of bi-directional movements for thousands of migrants from neighbouring countries to other countries, including the Arabian Peninsula.”

Referring to the UN World Human Rights Day, he stressed that Djibouti is destined to preserve the dignity of everyone and to guarantee the same value to all, as human rights are inalienable and universal.

More than 300 migrants transit Djibouti every day. Mainly from the Horn of Africa, these migrants continue to cross Djibouti to Yemen and other countries in the Gulf due to limited economic opportunities, instability and environmental degradation in their homeland.

The Minister of Health, Dr. Djama Elmi Okieh highlighted that the programme aims to provide primary and emergency health care to vulnerable populations to reduce mortality on migratory routes and to prevent the associated health risks that may affect host populations.

The mobile patrol will operate twice a week from December 2017. Doctors and nurses from the Ministry of Health and IOM medical team will provide medical treatment and water to migrants on the road who are mostly suffering from dehydration. Those who present serious conditions or have critical medical conditions will be referred to a local hospital in the region where they will receive medical care.

IOM Djibouti provides assistance to vulnerable migrants who come from Yemen or travel to Yemen via Djibouti in various regions in Djibouti. In Obock, migrants seeking assistance come to the Migration Response Centre (MRC) and are provided with food, water and medical treatment.

2389539,"International Development Minister praises British humanitarian heroes at Kemble disaster aid hub *Alistair Burt thanks DFID aid workers who have been helping to get emergency support in 2017 to those that so urgently need it*

Brave humanitarian workers based in Kemble, Gloucestershire, are the unsung heroes of 2017 for the role they played in Britain’s rapid responses to three major humanitarian catastrophes this year, the Minister for International Development Alistair Burt has said.

At Britain’s aid distribution hub at Cotswold Airport in Kemble, the Minister thanked staff for their tireless work delivering life-saving UK aid in response to the devastating Caribbean hurricanes, the ongoing Rohingya crisis and to prevent a famine in Somalia this year.

The facility in Kemble is one of two major global stockpiles where the Department for International Development stores life-saving equipment and supplies for crises – and is the only one based in Britain.

This year, emergency UK aid from emergency stockpiles, such as in Kemble, has provided:

- 827 tonnes of supplies in response to hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean, including 6,000 hygiene kits, 5,050 solar lanterns, 4,710 shelter kits, 5,140 water purification cubes and 16,000 buckets;

- 10,000 shelter kits, 20,000 blankets and 10,500 sleeping mats in response to the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh; and - 20,000 shelter kits and peg and pole sets to prevent the humanitarian situation in Somalia deteriorating further.

Speaking at the disaster aid hub in Kemble, International Development Minister Alistair Burt said:

""UK aid has saved countless lives this year by responding rapidly to disasters around the world and our aid distribution hub in Kemble is crucial to getting emergency support to those that so urgently need it.

""These brave humanitarian workers are the unsung heroes of 2017.

""They have played a vital role getting life-saving food, water and shelter to people struck by hurricanes in the Caribbean, innocent families driven from their homes in Burma and people starving because of the food crisis in East Africa.

""The UK prides itself on not only delivering aid quickly, but also making sure our products are the best possible quality.

""I am proud that we are driving innovation and the hub in Kemble is filled to the rafters with durable products that people in emergency situations can rely on in the toughest situations imaginable.

By maintaining its own supplies at Cotswold Airport, the Department for International Development (DFID) is able to fly emergency aid to people in disaster situations as quickly as possible.

The UK’s emergency response capacity has been increased this year and DFID is able to respond to six humanitarian emergencies a year, delivering life-saving supplies to 25,000 people in a disaster.

Staff are on alert 24 hours a day and are ready to respond to disasters that could strike at anytime, anywhere in the world.

Staff are busy restocking the aid distribution hub, which remains ready to respond to any emergencies and is expected to be fully stocked by Christmas Day.

**Notes to Editors**

1. DFID’s aid distribution hub in Kemble has been in operation for more than 8 years.

2. It currently stores solar lanterns, kitchen sets, shelter kits, water purification kits, armoured vehicles, a field hospital, a boat module, an office and life support module and part of an airfield module.

3. The site has 22,000 square foot of storage, which means DFID can respond to six crises a year. The supplies held in Kemble alone could deliver life-saving supplies to 25,000 people in a disaster situation.

4. The facility in Kemble is one of two major global stockpiles where the Department for International Development stores life-saving equipment and supplies for crises – the other stockpile is in Dubai.",267,"English"
2389534,"Germany Contributes EUR 23.15 Million to UNRWA for Projects in Gaza 22 December 2017

On 8 and 13 December 2017, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) signed two agreements with the German Development Bank (KfW) totaling EUR 23.15 million from the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

As part of the overall contribution, EUR 18.15 million will be allocated to the UNRWA reconstruction programme in Gaza, allowing the safe and dignified return of some 540 Palestine refugee families to their houses that were completely destroyed during the hostilities in the summer of 2014. Reaffirming Germany’s strong commitment to support Palestinian refugees in Gaza, this grant builds on earlier contributions in the amount of EUR 57 Million by the German Federal Government towards the UNRWA emergency shelter and reconstruction programme since 2014.

An additional EUR 5 million will be used for the construction and expansion of two UNRWA schools in the Gaza Strip which will benefit around 6,000 students. Two schools will be constructed using the completely renewed, innovative, child-friendly UNRWA school design and will significantly enhance education for thousands of children over the coming years. In total, UNRWA operates 267 schools in Gaza, providing primary education to a steadily increasing student population of now over 262,000 refugee children.

The German Representative in Ramallah, Mr. Peter Beerwerth, welcomed the additional funding: “With this substantial contribution to the UNRWA reconstruction programme in Gaza, Germany is continuing its support to Palestine refugees. 540 families will be able to rebuild their completely destroyed houses.

As education is of utmost importance to Germany, we are contributing an additional EUR 5 million to UNRWA schools in Gaza. With this German support, thousands of students will profit from an enhanced and safer learning environment,” he added.

“We highly value this generous contribution and the commitment of the Federal Republic of Germany to support the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip and the work of UNRWA work which will bring the response to reconstruction needs resulting from the massive destruction caused in 2014 a significant step towards completion. We are also very much appreciate the support from the BMZ and the KfW to build schools that will enable us to continue to provide quality education for Palestine refugees’ children in Gaza,” stated Mr. Matthias Schmale, Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza.

These additional contributions further extend the significant support that the German Federal Government is rendering towards Palestine refugees in Gaza. Germany continues to support UNRWA in the fields of humanitarian assistance, employment creation, infrastructure, reconstruction and rehabilitation. The new contributions are implemented through the state-owned development bank KfW.

In 2016, Germany was the Agency’s fourth largest donor, having contributed EUR 67,534,343 (USD 73,627,810) to UNRWA. Germany has been a member of the UNRWA Advisory Commission since 2005.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**  
UNRWA is confronted with an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions and financial support has been outpaced by the growth in needs. As a result, the UNRWA Programme Budget, which supports the delivery of core essential services, operates with a large shortfall. UNRWA encourages all Member States to work collectively to exert all possible efforts to fully fund the Agency’s Programme Budget. UNRWA emergency programmes and key projects, also operating with large shortfalls, are funded through separate funding portals.

UNRWA is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5 million registered Palestine refugees. Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight. UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection and microfinance.",267,"English"
2389529,"Mediterranean Migrant Arrivals Reach 170,249 in 2017; Deaths Reach 3,116 Geneva – IOM, the UN Migration Agency, reports that 170,249 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in 2017 through 20 December, with just over 70 percent arriving in Italy and the remainder divided between Greece, Cyprus and Spain. This compares with 359,160 arrivals across the region through the same period last year.

On Thursday (21 December) IOM Athens’ Kelly Namia reported on three incidents off the island of Lesvos and Rhodes that required search and rescue operation. The Hellenic Coast Guard managed to rescue the 120 migrants and transferred them to the respective islands.

Through 19 December, the total number of sea arrivals to Greek territory is 28,490 (see chart below).

IOM Spain’s Ana Dodevska reported that total arrivals at sea in 2017 have reached 21,468 men, women and children who have been rescued in Western Mediterranean waters through 21 December. That figure is 13,076 greater than through the same date in 2016.

IOM’s Missing Migrants Project (MMP) reported Thursday one new death on the Mediterranean as the remains of a migrant were found in a boat, four miles off the coast of San Roque, Cádiz (Spain) on 15 December. IOM has recorded the deaths of 223 migrants this year on the Western Mediterranean route to Spain in 2017—a number that surpasses the total number of deaths recorded in the Western Mediterranean for all of 2016, which totalled 128.  
Since the start of December, the Western Mediterranean has been the deadliest of all Mediterranean routes, with 15 deaths of sea borne migrants reported, compared to eight deaths this month on the Central Mediterranean and none this month in the Eastern Mediterranean. Twenty-three deaths this month on the Mediterranean is a significant decline from recent years. In 2015 over 200 drownings of migrants occurred on the Mediterranean in December; in 2016 almost 400 took place.  
Total deaths in the Mediterranean now stand at 3116 through 21 December, compared to 4,967 at this time last year.  
Worldwide, IOM’s Missing Migrant Project (MMP) has recorded the deaths of 5,362 people during migration in 2017. Besides the recent Mediterranean deaths, MMP recorded five Afghan migrants dying in a vehicle accident near Isfahan, Iran, on 16 December. On 19 December, an 18-year-old Pakistani boy died of hypothermia in the Evros River, on the border between Greece and Turkey.  
Also on 19 December, six migrants lost their lives in a vehicle accident in Tamaulipas, Mexico: five Honduran men and one Mexican woman travelling to the US border died on the Zaragoza-González highway.

2389524,"Migrant Vulnerability to Human Trafficking and Exploitation: Evidence from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean Migration Routes **New UN Migration Agency Report Sheds Light on Migrants’ Vulnerabilities to Human Trafficking and Exploitation En Route to Europe**

Geneva — There are specific risk factors associated with increased migrant vulnerability to exploitation, violence, abuse and human trafficking, according to a new report published yesterday (21/12) by IOM, the UN Migration Agency.

The report, titled Migrant Vulnerability to Human Trafficking and Exploitation: Evidence from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean Migration Routes, analyses quantitative data on vulnerability factors, as well as personal experiences of abuse, violence, exploitation, and human trafficking collected over the past two years from 16,500 migrants in seven countries.

While other IOM reports have documented the scale of exploitation on the main migration routes to Europe, this report is the first to identify key factors associated with increased vulnerability to exploitation and human trafficking during the journey. The data comes from IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).

“The findings contribute to our understanding of the factors that contribute to migrants’ vulnerability to abuse, exploitation and trafficking,” said Anh Nguyen, IOM Head of Migrant Assistance Division. “It improves the evidence available for policymakers to better identify and protect vulnerable migrants on their journeys, in line with IOM’s determinants of migrant vulnerability model,” he added.

“This report illustrates the kind of analysis that can be done with a unique set of survey data collected by IOM. The Displacement Tracking Matrix plays a key role in providing a better understanding of the movements and evolving needs of mobile populations along the major migration corridors,” said Nuno Nunes, DTM Global Coordinator.

The analysis found that migrants travelling the Central Mediterranean route are more vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking than migrants on the Eastern Mediterranean route, even when they share similar demographic and journey characteristics.

Moreover, West Africans are more vulnerable to human trafficking and exploitation than migrants from other countries. In general, the presence of conflict in the country of departure predicts a higher vulnerability to exploitation and human trafficking on the journey. Individuals who travel alone are more vulnerable than migrants who travel in groups. Also, the longer or costlier their journey, the more likely it is that migrants will be exploited along the way. Male migrants are more likely to experience forced and unpaid labour, or being held against their will, than female migrants.

The report also found that the factors that predict child migrants’ vulnerability to human trafficking and exploitation are similar to the factors associated with adult migrants’ vulnerability. In addition, migrants report that Libya is particularly unsafe; this is a major driver of onward migration towards what they perceive to be safer destinations.

This IOM analysis provides practical recommendations for improved programming along the main migration routes to Europe.

2389469,"2017 was hugely successful but challenges still lurk, says AU Special Representative for Somalia Nairobi, 21 December 2017 – The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (SRCC) Ambassador Francisco Madeira has described 2017 as hugely successful year in the fight against the Al-Shabaab but cautioned that there were challenges facing the transition from the multinational force to Somali security forces.

The SRCC named the successful conclusion of the electoral process that saw a new Parliament and Senate, culminating in the election of a new president as some of the milestones achieved by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in 2017.

Addressing a media briefing in Nairobi this morning, Ambassador Madeira said some of the challenges AMISOM faces include the dearth in funding and uncoordinated training of Somali security forces by different partners.

“The reality is, AMISOM and Somali security forces face major challenges due to unpredictable funding. Without funding, little can happen to move forward with certain undertakings already made on the security front,” said the SRCC who is also the head of AMISOM.

He said in 2018 AMISOM will require funding to recover territory under the control of Al-Shabaab, to enhance the capacity of Somali security forces to take over from AMISOM troops, and to integrate the Somali National Army (SNA).

“Militarily, subject to logistical support, we are planning elaborate offensive operations mainly in the Jubba valley, Gedo region and Middle Jubba regions which still harbor pockets of Al-Shabaab militants,” the SRCC noted.

Ambassador Madeira said this was part of AMISOM’s exit strategy to ensure that it liberates the entire country and hands it to Somali security forces. He called for synchronized training of the Somali National Army to establish a strong force capable of defending the country once AMISOM exits.

“The training of the army must be synchronized and centred upon a common doctrine and ideology. Currently, there are too many stakeholders involved in the training of security forces, without a harmonized plan as indicated in the operational readiness assessment,” the SRCC observed.

He noted that AMISOM’s exit (drawdown) had already started with about 1000 soldiers set to go home by the end of this month and an equal number will depart next year in accordance with the United Nations and the African Union recommendation on a gradual and phased re-organization of the Mission.

Ambassador Madeira however lamented the lack of resources to support AMISOM troops in executing their mandate.

“In a nutshell, we need urgent support. Our troops are ready but they need to be resourced. This has not been happening to expectation despite repeated commitments by partners in different forums,” the head of AMISOM noted.

He added that the multinational force was building capacity of the Somalia security forces so that when they exit, terror groups do not take over the liberated territories.

“We are planning to hand over to a properly capacitated Somali National Army at least 10 Forward Operating Bases next year as part of the transition. Discussions are ongoing with the Federal Government on modalities of this hand over,” the SRCC said.

Ambassador Madeira mentioned three pillars necessary in strengthening Somalia’s national security, namely, sustainable security reform, inclusive and stable politics and economic recovery.

He warned that jihadists fleeing from Libya, Yemen, and Syria were changing the dynamics of Somalia war, making it imperative that the transition should be well managed.

The Mission, whose mandate ends on May 31 after 10 years restoring peace in this Horn of Africa nation, is gradually scaling down its military operations, in what is called “drawdown”. According to the UN Security Council Resolution 2372 (2017), the Federal Government of Somalia will progressively take over AMISOM’s responsibilities.",267,"English"

2389439,"Zimbabwe Food Security Outlook Update, December 2017 **Below normal rains received across the bulk of the country during the first half of the season**

KEY MESSAGES 

• Most northern and typical cereal-surplus areas continue to experience Minimal (IPC Phase 1) food security outcomes which are expected through March 2018 and for the remainder of the outlook period. However, typical cereal-deficit areas in the southern, western, and extreme northern regions are currently Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) due to low or depleted ownproduced food stocks and limited livelihood activities. Some areas are being targeted for humanitarian assistance, but only during the period of January to March 2018 will the level of assistance in a few districts improve outcomes to Stressed (IPC Phase 2!).

• Below normal cumulative rainfall has been received across the bulk of the country since the start of the 2017-18 rainfall season in October and November. The worst affected province is Mashonaland West, one of the highest surplus-producing areas in the country. Planted area is lower than typical in most areas and agricultural activity is below-normal as well.

• Maize grain supplies in local markets is unusually good across most parts of the country, so the typical pattern of the movement of grain from surplus areas in the north to deficit areas in the south is not occurring. Maize grain prices continue to be atypically stable and below average, but due to poor livelihoods and cash shortages, the majority of poor households are still not able to access maize grain.",267,"English"
2389434,"Philippines: Tropical Storm Tembin Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF n° MDRPH026 **A. SITUATION ANALYSIS**

*Description of the disaster*

There have been two significant weather systems to enter the Philippines Area of Responsibility (PAR) since 12 December 2017. 

Tropical Storm Kai-tak: On 12 December 2017, a low-pressure area (LPA) within the PAR developed into a Tropical Depression which was named Kai-tak (locally Urduja). The tropical depression moved north northwest, and by 14 December was reclassified as a Tropical Storm. Kai-tak remained almost stationary off the coast of the Eastern Visayas region and continued to bring moderate to heavy rain across the Bicol and Eastern Visayas regions as it slowly moved towards land. Kai-tak kept its slow pace and eventually made landfall on the afternoon of 16 December 2017 over San Policarpio, Eastern Samar. 

Kai-tak brought heavy rain which triggered flashfloods, floods and a reported 17 landslides in the Eastern Visayas region. In some areas in the province of Samar, as much as two months’ worth of rain poured over a 24-hour span. Tacloban City in Leyte was put under state of calamity on 15 December 2017 due to floods. The municipality of Naval in Biliran province was also put under a state of calamity due to landslides. National disaster management authorities said 41 people were killed and 45 others remain missing. 

As Kai-tak approached, the Philippine government ordered the pre-emptive evacuation of families in the likely affected areas in Eastern Visayas. As of 20 December 2017, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), more than 280,000 families were affected in Region IV-B (MIMAROPA), Region-V (Bicol Region), Region VI (Western Visayas), Region VII (Central Visayas), Region VIII (Eastern Visayas) and CARAGA. Of the affected, more than 267,000 families were from Region VIII and more than 7,500 from Region V. Moreover, some 11,000 families, mostly from Northern and Western Samar province are still housed in 205 evacuation centres. 

Tropical Storm Tembin (Vinta): According to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), an LPA off Mindanao intensified into a Tropical Storm before dawn on Thursday, 21 December 2017, as it continued heading for land. In a bulletin issued at 05:00, 21 December 2017, PAGASA said Tembin had maximum winds of 65 kilometres per hour (kph) and gustiness of up to 80 kph. The tropical storm was 510 kilometres east of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur as of reporting, moving west at a slightly slower 18 kph from the previous 20 kph. PAGASA warned that scattered to widespread moderate to heavy rain is expected over Eastern Visayas,  
CARAGA and Davao Regions within 24 hours. Residents of these areas have been advised to undertake precautionary measures, coordinate with their respective local disaster risk reduction and management offices, and continue monitoring for updates.  

Based on its latest forecast track, Tembin will make landfall over CARAGA - Davao Region area between Thursday (December 21) evening and Friday (December 22) morning. After landfall, Tembin is expected to cross CARAGA, Northern Mindanao, the Zamboanga Peninsula, and Southern Palawan. It will then leave PAR on 24 December 2017.  

Residents of Eastern Mindanao and Eastern Visayas have been put on alert for possible flash floods and landslides. These areas are particularly susceptible to the impacts of heavy rains with flash floods, landslides and flooding.  

Eastern Visayas is still suffering from the damage brought by Tropical Depression Kai-tak, which battered the region as a tropical storm. It is expected that Tropical Storm Tembin will exacerbate the issues in the Kai-tak affected areas.",267,"English"
2389429,"Tambura Displacement Brief: Tambura County, Western Equatoria State, South Sudan, November 2017 **Background**

Following reports of returnee influx from the Central African Republic (CAR) to bordering areas in Western Equatoria State, REACH deployed as part of a multi-agency assessment to Tambura town, the border town of Source Yubu and surrounding areas to understand displacement patterns and access to services for newly arrived internally displaced person (IDP) and local communities. Tambura town was assessed on 8 November and Source Yubu was assessed on 9 November. REACH conducted five focus group discussions (FGDs) with newly arrived IDPs and members of the local community and two key informant interviews with Relief Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) officials. Eight settlements were furthermore assessed remotely through Key Informant (KI) interviews.

**Population Movement and Displacement**

The population of Tambura County has reportedly rapidly increased since the beginning of the year with reported influx of returnees from CAR as well as IDPs from neighbouring counties.

**Returns from CAR**

Since June 2017, high numbers of South Sudanese refugees started to come back from Obo Camp in southeastern CAR. The RRC recorded 6,212 returnees (1,517 households (HHs)) in Source Yubu and 16,699 IDPs/returnees (8,360 HHs) in Tambura,2 though no humanitarian organizations have been able to verify these numbers.  

The main challenge along the traveling route reported by the returning population was hunger. While able-bodied individuals reportedly took between 5 to 9 days to travel from Obo Camp to Source Yubu and another 3 to 5 days to reach Tambura town, those traveling with young children took much longer, often several weeks.  

FGD participants reported that the returns were primarily motivated by a lack of food inside the camp, where food distributions stopped around June due to insecurity along the supply route.3 Refugees in Obo Camp were reportedly not allowed to access land for cultivation and were therefore completely dependent on food assistance. Another reported reason for return was the fear of conflict, which is currently affecting CAR.

FGD participants reported that Obo Camp mainly hosted refugees from Source Yubu, which fled South Sudan following conflict which began in 2015. The most recent clashes in Source Yubu took place around November 2016 when most of the population was displaced to Bambouti, a town located approximately 5 km west of the border inside of CAR, from where they were transferred to Obo Camp earlier in the year. Other refugees in Obo Camp were reportedly from Ezo,  
Tambura and Nagero Counties, suggesting that small numbers of refugees might also be returning to those areas.

The vast majority of the returnees are originally from Source Yubu.  
Some of the returnees were able to settle again in their former communities in Source Yubu. A substantial proportion, however, reportedly found their houses destroyed or occupied by armed actors upon return and decided to move on towards Tambura town.  
Returnees/IDPs are scattered in and around Tambura town where they have settled with the local communities.

**Displacement from Bazia Road, Wau County**

Between February and April 2017, heavy clashes displaced populations living along the Bazia road in Western Bahr el Ghazal towards Jur River County and Farajallah village, Wau County. A smaller number reportedly fled south to Nagero and Tambura Counties. According to recent reports, 700 IDPs have settled in Nagero town,5 while the RRC in Tambura town recorded another 300 HHs which reportedly arrived between February and May 2017.

**Displacement from Nadiangare village, Yambio County**

According to the RRC in Tambura town, approximately, 1,980 IDPs (325 HHs) have reportedly arrived between December 2016 and February 2017 from Nadiangare Village in Yambio County. Most of these IDPs have reportedly settled 10 km outside of Tambura town in Seneguse settlement (Mupoi Payam), after initial displacement from Nadiangare village due to heavy clashes.

**Displacement from Ezo town, Ezo County**

Frequent clashes between 2015 and 2017 displaced people from Ezo town and outskirts towards Tambura town and surroundings, while others fled across the border to refugee camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There are no official estimate numbers of IDPs from Ezo. However, FGD participants estimated around 2,000-3,000 individuals, some of whom have reportedly returned to Ezo town and surroundings.

**Refugees from Central African Republic**

Reports shared by the Refugee Commission Affairs of 119 newly arrived refugees (22 HHs) from CAR could not be confirmed during the mission to Tambura. The RRC had reportedly no information about recent arrivals and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) could only verify nine newly arrived refugees from CAR. UNHCR had registered 812 refugees (250 HHs) that had fled intensive conflict between 2009 and 2012. Those refugees have settled within the Tambura community and were therefore reportedly not interested in relocation to refugee camps.",267,"English"
2389424,"Food Security Early Warning System - Agromet Update, Issue 2: 2017/2018 Agricultural Season **Highlights**

- Good rains were received in the northern half of the region.
- Low rainfall in the southern half of the region led to delays in planting and crop moisture stress in some areas.
- Vegetation conditions deteriorated in southern and eastern parts of the region.
- A fall armyworm outbreak has affected 20 out of 28 districts in Malawi.

**Regional Summary**

Northern parts of the region received good rainfall since October, and most areas had normal to above normal cumulative rainfall totals as of mid-December 2017 (Figure 1, green colours). Areas where above normal rains were received include the north-eastern half of Angola, much of DRC, north Zambia, northern Mozambique, northern and central Madagascar, and much of Tanzania.  
In contrast, most places in the southern half of the region received below average rainfall since October 2017 (yellow and brown colours, Figure 1). These areas include southern Angola, most of Botswana and Namibia, south-western and central South Africa, Lesotho, southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, Zimbabwe, and south-western Madagascar. Some bimodal areas in the north-eastern parts of Tanzania also received well below average rainfall. November was particularly dry in many of these areas, while southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, and Zimbabwe received low rainfall in the first half of December. 

Despite the low rainfall in the southern half of the region, most areas had experienced an onset of rains by early December (Figure 2). In a few areas where the seasonal rains have not yet started, the delay in onset ranges from approximately 20 to 30 days (grey colours, Figure 2).  

Areas affected include south-western Angola, parts of southern and central Mozambique, parts of northern Namibia, and southern South Africa. A prolonged delay in the onset of rains can negatively affect crop yields by reducing the number of days available for crop development, and crops can fail to reach maturity before the end of the growing season. Most areas where the season has already started experienced a timely onset of rains, except for parts of Lesotho, South Africa, DRC and Zimbabwe, where the onset was delayed by as much as 30 to 40 days. Due to the generally timely onset, farmers in many areas have started planting, with reports of crops being in the initial to early vegetative stage in some areas.  

However, in some of the areas that received below average rainfall in November through early December, particularly southern Mozambique, southern Zambia and Zimbabwe, crops have been affected by insufficient moisture, with reports that some farmers have not yet planted. In cases where planting has already occurred in the above-mentioned areas, some crops are reported to be experiencing moisture stress due to the prevailing dry conditions.  

As a result of the dry spell, vegetation conditions have deteriorated in many areas. The satellite vegetation index image (Figure 3) shows that many parts of the region had below average vegetation conditions (yellow and brown colours, Figure 3) by the first dekad of December.  
Reports from Namibia indicate that the poor rainfall has led to a deterioration of grazing conditions in several parts of the country. As a consequence, livestock are reported to be in poor to fair body condition in parts of the country, although livestock in other areas were reported to be in fair to good condition.  

SADC Climate Services Centre, in conjunction with national meteorological agencies from the region, in December issued an updated seasonal rainfall forecast for the Jan-to-Mar, Feb-to-Apr, and Mar-to-May 2017 periods for the SADC region. The forecast update maintained a higher likelihood for normal rainfall in all parts of the region, with a potential tendency for above normal rainfall in most areas. Among countries that updated their forecasts for January to March, Botswana and Zimbabwe reduced their expectations for above normal rainfall. Botswana’s revised forecast predicts normal to above normal rainfall in most areas except for eastern Botswana where normal rainfall is expected, while Zimbabwe expects normal rainfall throughout the country for the January-March period. Users are advised to contact their respective national meteorological agencies for forecast updates and interpretation.  

Given the poor rains that have been received in the southern half of the region to date, well distributed rains will be required for the remainder of the season in order to avert negative climatic impacts on agriculture. A continuation of good rains in the northern half as forecast will raise the potential for good production in those areas. The latest forecasts, which are generally presenting reduced chances for above normal rainfall in some southern parts of the region, imply the need for farming methods that promote conservation of soil moisture and reduce the risk of severe crop moisture stress due to dry spells that can potentially occur, especially in the climatologically drier areas. These methods include mulching and minimum tillage, amongst others.  

Interventions to promote the availability of functional irrigation equipment where possible are also important, as they can reduce the potential impact of dry spells in areas where they normally occur.  
A fall armyworm (FAW) outbreak occurred in Malawi in December, affecting 20 out of 28 districts in the country, and close to 140,000 farming households. These districts have been declared as disaster areas by the President of Malawi. The presence of the FAW was also reported for the first time in Madagascar in October 2017. This brings to 13 the number of countries in the SADC region where the FAW presence has been reported since 2016 – Mauritius and Lesotho are the only countries in the region where the pest has not been observed and reported. Crop pest experts from Africa and around the world have held several meetings in the region to provide situational updates and facilitate preparedness and coordination among stakeholders. The experts have recommended that the FAW needs to be managed using integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, as an effective, safe and sustainable response to the food security threat posed by the pest.",267,"English"

2389389,"After 1,000 days of conflict, major humanitarian challenges threaten lives in Yemen Sana’a—The two-and-a-half-year-old conflict in Yemen has left a catastrophe. The crisis has continued to deteriorate following last month’s escalation of fighting in the north, as well as explosions in the south.

Essential services have collapsed and approximately 75 per cent of Yemenis need humanitarian assistance. A cholera outbreak has affected 21 of the 22 Governorates, while only 50 per cent of health facilities remain functioning in the country.

Famine has also increased the suffering of the war-torn country’s population with an estimated 7.3 million people, including 2.4 million children under five, in need of urgent life-saving food assistance.

IOM staff has been prevented from leaving their homes during this period, and their capacity to reach people in desperate need of humanitarian aid has been greatly affected. Access continues to be a major issue, as several main roads remain blocked. Fuel shortages have also limited the humanitarian community's ability to transport aid. 

“The world has almost never seen something as grave as the humanitarian crisis in Yemen,” said William Lacy Swing, UN Migration Agency Director General. “With such a complex situation in the country, reaching people in need – both Yemenis and migrants – is a priority for all IOM at all levels. Despite the deteriorated security situation and challenges on the ground, IOM is still operating across all the 22 Governorates of the country but if the situation continues to worsen I am not sure we will be able to protect the lives we are now for much longer,” said DG Swing.

Since the start of December, IOM has provided nearly 20,600 medical consultations to internally displaced peoples and other conflict-affected Yemenis via 22 mobile health teams and two permanent health facilities. These provide life-saving emergency healthcare. Some 3,231 people have received psychosocial support through IOM individual and group sessions. IOM’s mobile health teams also have been able to reach children and lactating women in the remote areas where services have been destroyed or absent.

As part of the humanitarian community’s cholera response, IOM treated 25,324 suspected cholera/acute watery diarrhoea cases so far in the last five months of this year. IOM supports 13 Diarrhoea Treatment Centers and 66 Oral Rehydration Points (ORPs) in seven Governorates: Taiz, Hajjah, Al Hudaydah, Shabwa, Abyan, Al Dhale’e and Ibb.

“The security situation is unstable, forcing us to change our implementation plans weekly,” said Said Mageed Alkaladi, IOM Senior Emergency Operations Assistant, a Yemeni humanitarian worker in the South. “We always search for new ways to reach people most in need with aid. A big part of this is speaking with the affected communities regularly to find the best way to implement and to meet their needs. We are part of these communities and we stand accountable to meet the needs in a timely manner despite all the challenges,” said Alkaladi.

Access to clean water and safe sanitation is closely linked to improving the dire health situation in Yemen. To complement its healthcare support, IOM is providing water chlorination, water trucking, solid waste management, distribution of cholera/hygiene kits and hygiene awareness sessions. Over the past few weeks, IOM has rehabilitated water sites, increasing access to safe drinking water for people in Lahj, Abyan and Shabwa Governorates.

Through its Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), IOM monitors the needs of conflict-affected Yemenis. The data is used to tailor the humanitarian communities’ response to the crisis. One of the greatest needs found among those displaced in the country is shelter.

Over the past three weeks, IOM was able to distribute around shelter and relief kits, which include materials to build or reinforce shelters, ensuring that over 5,600 families in the northern Governorates of Taizz, Ibb, Hajja and Amran had a roof over their heads. This month, IOM has also helped 45 displaced families relocate from 11 schools and build safe shelters to live in, while then renovating the schools so that they are back in use by teachers and students.

Although Yemen is facing one of the gravest humanitarian crises in the world, around 80,000 migrants have entered the country from January to October this year. These migrants usually hope to transit through the Yemen to reach the countries beyond, but often find themselves trapped at the conflict’s front lines in a dire need of protection and lifesaving assistance.

Through its two Migrant Response Points in Aden and Al-Hudaydah, as well as its patrolling teams along the Yemeni coast, IOM is supporting stranded migrants by providing aid and humanitarian return assistance.

Over the past three weeks, more than 4,100 migrants received medical assistance through IOM health facilities, in addition to 1,100 migrants who received psychosocial support.  
Last week, IOM, in coordination with UNHCR, helped 150 Somali refugees return home through the port of Aden. Tomorrow (23/12), IOM expects to help an additional 100 Ethiopian migrants leave Yemen’s conflict through the port of Houdaida.

2389374,"As Yemen humanitarian crisis escalates, small number of governments step up to save lives ROME – With more than eight million people now dependent on food assistance for survival in Yemen, the fate of those caught up in the country’s long running conflict is now in the hands of a small number of donor governments. Nearly 80 percent of United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) funding for Yemen this year has been provided by the United States, Germany, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, with the US providing the largest single amount (US$386 million).

“We are more than 1,000 days into the Yemen crisis, and the only way we’re able to continue to offer assistance for millions of Yemenis is due to the generosity of a handful of dedicated countries,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “The people of these countries and their governments are saving lives in Yemen every day, and we say a heartfelt ‘thank you’ for their support. But the situation remains desperate, so we need more governments to provide funding immediately so we can keep people alive. And most importantly, we call for an end to the conflict that is causing this catastrophe.”

Additional significant contributions to WFP operations in Yemen this year have come from Japan, UN Funds and Agencies, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), Saudi Arabia, Norway and Canada. CERF receives broad support from UN Member States, with Germany, Sweden, the UK, Netherlands and Norway topping its list of donors in 2017.

Despite the generosity of these donors, WFP operations in Yemen require an additional US$277 million to provide food assistance through June next year. Since August, WFP has provided food assistance to seven million people, but around half of these people received a mere 60% of their rations due to funding constraints.

Ranks: 188 out of 188 countries in Human Development Index (UNDP)

2.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid

Over 633 300 internally displaced and 545 497 CAR refugees in neighbouring countries (UNHCR)

1.4 million people food insecure

1.8 million children are affected by the crisis (UNICEF)

EU humanitarian funding:            
€22.5 million in 2017                
€136 million since 2013 

**Introduction**

More than four years after the crisis broke out in December 2013, the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) remains extremely serious. Humanitarian needs are on the rise and have reached a level similar to the peak of the crisis in 2013-2014. Fourteen humanitarian workers have been killed so far this year, which makes CAR the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarians after Syria. In November, international aid organisations in some areas in the north suspended their activities and evacuated all their staff.

**What are the needs?**

Some 2.2 million people in the country – almost half of the population – are in need of humanitarian assistance. Around 1.4 million people are food insecure. Chronic malnutrition has increased and is currently among the highest in the world (around 40% of the under 5-year old population according to UNICEF). Communities' stocks are empty and livelihoods have been severely affected by fighting and looting, provoking substantial increases in food prices and a substantial decrease in household income. The situation of the still very high number of internally displaced is of particular concern. 

The weak national health system has collapsed due to widespread violence. There is also a severe shortage of skilled health workers and medical supplies. Up to 58% of health infrastructures are supported by humanitarian actors. This lack of access to basic healthcare continues to have serious repercussions for the population. Needs in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are particularly severe in the areas most affected by the conflict and maintaining an adequate level of WASH remains a challenge, especially in internally displaced person's (IDP) sites. Safe drinking water is scarce. 

The crisis has also spilled over into neighbouring countries (in particular in Chad and Cameroon) and the effects are considerable, notably in terms of pressure on local resources.

**How are we helping?**

With over €400 million provided since 2014, the European Union (Commission + Member States) is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to CAR. The European Commission alone has provided €136 million in humanitarian aid inside the country since December 2013, in addition to over €83 million for Central African refugees in neighbouring countries.  

The spill-over over the crisis to neighbouring countries has been significant, with the refugee situation becoming protracted. Humanitarian needs created by the CAR conflict, including in bordering Cameroon and Chad, are therefore considered a forgotten humanitarian crisis by the European Commission.  

The Commission's humanitarian assistance primarily targets needs in the areas of food, health, emergency shelter, water, sanitation and protection of civilians. Relief assistance is focused on displaced people both inside and outside IDP camps, as well as on refugees who mostly rely on humanitarian assistance to cover their needs. Support to operations (coordination, air services) is also crucial.  

The Commission also funds humanitarian projects to enable free access to primary health care services through mobile clinics, with a main focus on life-saving interventions and the control of epidemic-prone infectious diseases. Projects seeking to improve the protection of civilians are also being supported, including tracking of incidents, medical, psychosocial and legal support to victims, as well as actions offering a protective environment for children. 
 
In 2017, the European Commission has also supported the UN humanitarian air services (UNHAS) in order to facilitate the transport of humanitarian personnel to remote locations which would otherwise remain inaccessible due to insecurity and very poor infrastructure.",267,"English"
2389319,"Assessment of the economic impact of investment in disaster risk reduction and prevention: The case of Tabasco This study assesses the role of the investments made in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and prevention in the actual reduction of the impact of floods in the state of Tabasco between 2007 and 2010. Based on a previous study conducted within the framework of the Technical Assistance Agreement between the Mexican Government and the World Bank, it was found that the intense rainfall events occurring in Tabasco in 2007 and 2010 were similar in terms of their hydrometeorological characteristics (rainfall) and spatial distribution (rainfall fields). When analyzing the accumulated rainfall recorded for both events, it was found that the magnitude of the 2010 floods was greater than that of the 2007 floods.

However, damages and losses estimations recorded by the National Center for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) show an 80 percent reduction in 2010, compared to 2007 (World Bank, 2014). The similarity between these two events provides an ideal “natural experiment” scenario to evaluate the benefits of the investments in DRR made between 2008 and 2010.

Motivated by the devastating floods that occurred in October 2007, the Mexican Federal Government, together with the Government of the State of Tabasco, designed the Comprehensive Water Plan of Tabasco (PHIT, Plan Hídrico Integral de Tabasco) and began its implementation. The aim of the PHIT was to come up with a set of solutions that guaranteed the population’s safety, as well as the performance and continuity of economic activities and the balance of ecosystems in the occurrence of floods. The PHIT provides for the implementation of structural measures (physical investments, such as embankments and reinforcements) and non-structural measures (non-engineering measures, such as workshops, trainings, development of early warning systems and drawing of risk maps, among others).

The aim of this analysis is to assess the impact caused by the floods and the investments in DRR on the socioeconomic wellbeing of the population of Tabasco. For that purpose, estimations were made of the impact on the school dropout rate for Basic Education students (primary and secondary levels), and of the effect onthe economic activity of the state (measured through changes in the intensity of nighttime lights [or NTL]). On the one hand, the results show that the fluvial flooding level (GLOFRIS) indeed has a negative effect on the level of school dropout and on the changes in NTL. On the other hand, no robust results were found for the effect of the investments in DRR, even after correctinga possible bias resulting from their location. conclusion, the results obtained in this studyreinforce those found in the previous one (World Bank, 2014): the impact of the 2007 floods was greater than that of the 2010 floods, even though the latter year was characterized by rainfall events of a greater magnitude.",267,"English"
2389309,"EASO signs new Special Support Plan with Cyprus **EASO and Cyprus extend Special Support Plan for country’s asylum services**

The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the Government of Cyprus have signed a new agreement that will see the Agency’s Special Support Plan (SSP) extended until 31 January 2019, with additional amendments to its tasks.

The Amended SSP was signed by the Executive Director of EASO, José Carreira, and the Minister of Interior of Cyprus, Constantinos Petrides. The agreement will build on the expansion in support activities that EASO has been delivering throughout 2017 to improve and enhance the country’s asylum and reception system. 

In addition to extending the applicability, the new SSP also amends the previous version with new specific deliverables that EASO will provide in its operations supporting backlog management and in the field of reception and open accommodation. José Carreira welcomed the signing of the new SSP as a further bolstering of the close cooperation between EASO and Cyprus’ Asylum Service:

“Today’s extension of the SSP with our colleagues in Cyprus strengthens EASO’s support to the country and enables us to keep building on the operational assistance we have been providing. I look forward to the work ahead; the Agency will do all it can to support Cyprus in managing its asylum and reception system as efficiently as possible.”

EASO’s support for backlog management began in [February 2017](https://www.easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-enhance-its-support-cyprus), whereby the Agency deployed eight dedicated experts later in the year in order to assist Cyprus in clearing the backlog caused by an elevated number of applications for international protection in recent years.   In addition to amending the Agency’s deliverables in this area, the new SSP also sets out EASO’s support in the field of reception and open accommodation through a series of measures.

The operational support is carried out exclusively at the request of, and on behalf of, the authorities in Cyprus. EASO does not take decisions on applications for international protection or carry out any executive functions. 

**Background**

In September, [Mr. Carreira visited Cyprus](https://www.easo.europa.eu/easo-executive-director-visit-cyprus-support-to-country) to open EASO’s office in Nicosia and to discuss the Agency’s operational support with Minister Petrides.

Cyprus first requested special support from EASO to improve the asylum and reception system in specific areas on 26 May 2014. Currently, in addition to the deployment of experts specialised in backlog management, EASO also simultaneously deploys 8 experts at the Kofinou reception center, assisting in vulnerability assessment, social assistance, and additional capacity building activities.

As a measure of contingency planning, EASO also stands ready to provide operational assistance to Cyprus in the field of registration, screening and reception of persons requesting international protection in case of high number of arrivals.

*As prepared for delivery*

Thank you to Minister Sigrid Kaag and her excellent team, and to Mayor Krikke and the municipality of The Hague, for hosting and supporting us here at the Centre for Humanitarian Data. We are also absolutely thrilled to do this with the Government of the Netherlands.

I am also pleased to see so many members of the UN family here, including Vitaly Vanshelboim of the UN Office for Project Services, who are a critical partner for us in the Centre as well as representatives of OCHA’s generous donors.

Historically, many millions of people across the planet have died in famines, floods, fighting and other disasters, without anyone elsewhere in the world ever knowing it was happening. Modern technology means that we can now see pretty much everything, everywhere, all the time.

When people see suffering, in other places, the natural human reaction is to want to help. With today’s technology, we have the chance to identify problems as they appear, predict what will happen next and organize an effective response. The potential for saving lives and reducing suffering is literally enormous.

In 2014, OCHA launched the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) to improve data sharing. HDX is now used in every active crisis around the world including Bangladesh, Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan, and by users across some 165 countries. New organizations join HDX every week. Soon Facebook will become a member too, recognizing the values we attach to partnerships with business.

The Centre for Humanitarian Data is the next leg of this journey. Going far beyond HDX, it aims to use high quality data to identify and predict humanitarian problems. And then to enable responders to take action much faster, better, and more cheaply than is possible at the moment. One of the challenges then for the centre is to make sure it is doing more that is actionable.

I am also pleased that the Centre for Humanitarian Data is part of The Hague Humanity Hub. By creating an open workspace in which technology companies, academics, humanitarian groups and others can collaborate, the Hub will create a new kind of business model that befits the humanitarian challenges of the 21st century.

2389244,"Bangladesh: What we do for Rohingya families **I’ve been here for ten days now. My baby is absolutely exhausted.”** – A young Rohingya refugee mother at Cox’s Bazar

At the end of August 2017, renewed violence against the Rohingya minority broke out in the State of Rakhine. The conflict forced more than 600,000 people to flee their villages and cross the frontier to seek refuge in Bangladesh, in the region of Cox’s Bazar, joining the 220,000 other refugees already installed there. The Rohingya families live here in extremely difficult conditions, with no access to basic services. Many of them have gone through traumatic experiences, making them even more vulnerable when faced with an uncertain future.

Having returned from a mission of evaluation at the beginning of October in the refugee camps at Cox’s Bazar, Pierluigi Testa, health expert in Terre des hommes’ (Tdh) humanitarian aid department, tells us what he witnessed there and comments on some of his photos.

During the assessment tour, our team visited several camps. [This photo illustrates the density](https://www.tdh.ch/sites/default/files/rohingya1_inside-actu_-900-600.jpg) of the refugee population and the immense geographic expansion of the new camps: “The further we went, the more we discovered new shelters behind the hills,” says Pierluigi. The new refugee camps have no access by road and the only way to help the inhabitants is to go there by foot. During the rainy season, the paths are transformed into muddy rivers, further aggravating the refugees’ living conditions and making humanitarian aid even more difficult.

So as to fully understand the situation of the Rohingya refugees and the conditions under which they are living, our team of experts went to meet the people – marching for hours through the hills and the camps. They talked to many families and asked them about their needs, about their access to water and food, and on the physical and psychological state of their children.

The Rohingya refugees installed themselves in this zone of expansion in the Kutupalong camp in February and March this year. They have already received some aid, such as the building of this water point. However, despite their arrival having been some months ago, access to clean water is not assured. During the evaluation visit, our team recorded the lack of a water draining system and of protective barriers. Such conditions aggravate the risks of epidemics linked to the poor quality of the water. In this region where cholera is endemic, the massive influx of refugees worsens the dangers of transmission of water-borne diseases like cholera and diarrhoea.

This father has lost his wife, killed during the violent clashes endured in Myanmar, and is now left alone with his four children. Without work, this young man cannot meet the needs of his children, who suffer from malnutrition. When we visited him, not one of the little ones had been taken into care or admitted to a nutritional programme, although the family had arrived five months ago.

“The first time we came to Burma Para, the hills behind the camp were still empty. But when we came back, the camp had doubled in size,” says Pierluigi. “Here, the Rohingyas who arrived at least two weeks ago can be found,” he adds. These latest refugees build their shelters with bamboo, straw and refuse bags to protect themselves from the rain. There is nothing at all on the ground, not even a mattress. The living conditions of these new refugees are desperate. Not a single international actor was on the spot at the time of our evaluation.

[This photo shows the shelter of a recently arrived family:](https://www.tdh.ch/sites/default/files/rohingya6_inside-actu_-900-600_0.jpg) the wife is alone with her three children, aged five, three and one-and-a-half. A few sacks of food containing maize and flour, a kit of hygienic products and a bucket for drawing water are the sole assistance she has received since she arrived at the camp. She told us how difficult it is for her to go to fetch water and food, as she is quite alone with her very young children. 

A new-born baby, barely 24 hours old. The mother gave birth here, alone in her shelter. When Pierluigi met her, she had not had any postnatal consultation, either for herself or for her baby. When he asked her if she had been able to breastfeed the baby, the young woman replied: “I don’t have any milk”. When a mother has an insufficient food intake, her body cannot produce milk. “This is a part of our project. We will provide all the care required to pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as to children from 0 to 5 years of age, or older if needed,” he assured us.

A large number of malnourished children were identified by our experts. Talking to the women, one of them said: “I’ve been here for 10 days. I can only give my children some food once a day.” The child held in her arms is not yet two years old. She admitted that her child is “exhausted”. The child is, in fact, suffering from malnutrition.

Here, one of our doctors palpates a child’s foot. This is a quick test to establish a child’s nutritional condition through signs of pitting: a gesture that serves to demonstrate oedema in the lower limbs, a potential sign of malnutrition.

**What we do for the Rohingya families**

An operational emergency team is presently on the spot to roll out the projects aimed at saving lives. We are drawing upon our long experience in Bangladesh – we have been running healthcare projects for the past 30 years in northern and southern regions of that country – by setting up activities for peri- and postnatal healthcare, for prevention and treatment of malnutrition, for hygiene and sanitation, and finally psychosocial activities for the children and their parents.

The strength of our activities lies in their multi-sectoral approach: all visits and medical care are coupled with a component of protection. This means that our co-workers assess the state of a child’s health and treat it whilst informing themselves of the family’s living conditions and the psychological state of the children. In this way we aim to reduce both child and mother mortality, and the vulnerability of the Rohingya refugees most affected by the conflict.

We need supplementary funding to be able to help even more Rohingya children:

The prolonged presence of refugees in Chad and the continuous reduction in available funding for food and non-food assistance, have led the humanitarian community to reconsider the type of interventions in place. Between 2014 and 2015, WFP and UNHCR conducted a socio-economic categorization in refugee camps in Southern and South-eastern parts of the country with the strong involvement of CNARR (Government agency for refugees and returnees). Based on lessons learned from that approach, the 2016 Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) recommended an update in 2017. The current exercise was designed to go beyond a simple categorization and thus identify refugee household that can be empowered in the short to medium term as well as factors that can enable self-reliance. The results of profiling should be used to develop a new strategic needs-based approach. During the exercise, the technical teams decided to include in the analysis Nigerian and Central Africans refugees who arrived more recently but who may eventually face the same difficulties. 

**2- Key figures**

- Initial data collection was conducted between 17 June and 15 July 2017. An additional round for Central African refugees installed in host villages in southern Chad was organized from 25 July to 4 August 2017.

- 544 officers including 435 interviewers ensured data collection; supervision and data quality check was provided by the staff of CNARR, UNHCR and WFP;.

- 19 camps and 9 host villages were visited by data collection teams.

2389189,"As Yemen humanitarian crisis escalates, small number of governments step up to save lives ROME – With more than eight million people now dependent on food assistance for survival in Yemen, the fate of those caught up in the country’s long running conflict is now in the hands of a small number of donor governments. Nearly 80 percent of United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) funding for Yemen this year has been provided by the United States, Germany, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, with the US providing the largest single amount (US$386 million).

“We are more than 1,000 days into the Yemen crisis, and the only way we’re able to continue to offer assistance for millions of Yemenis is due to the generosity of a handful of dedicated countries,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “The people of these countries and their governments are saving lives in Yemen every day, and we say a heartfelt ‘thank you’ for their support. But the situation remains desperate, so we need more governments to provide funding immediately so we can keep people alive. And most importantly, we call for an end to the conflict that is causing this catastrophe.”

Additional significant contributions to WFP operations in Yemen this year have come from Japan, UN Funds and Agencies, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), Saudi Arabia, Norway and Canada. CERF receives broad support from UN Member States, with Germany, Sweden, the UK, Netherlands and Norway topping its list of donors in 2017.

Despite the generosity of these donors, WFP operations in Yemen require an additional US$277 million to provide food assistance through June next year. Since August, WFP has provided food assistance to seven million people, but around half of these people received a mere 60% of their rations due to funding constraints.

**Yemen in Numbers**

Population: 29.3 million

Internally displaced people including returnees: 3 million

People in need of humanitarian assistance: 22.2 million

People who are food-insecure: 17.8 million

People who are severely food-insecure: 8.4 million

Acutely malnourished children six months to five years: 1.8 million

Acutely malnourished pregnant or nursing women: 1.1 million

Children under-five suffering from severe acute malnutrition: 400,000

• Drought conditions remain critical: Due to drought, water stress is acute, milk production and livestock prices are well below normal, and livestock mortality is rising in the following counties: Garissa, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kilifi, Laisamis, Narok, Samburu (East),  Tana River, and Wajir (South and West).

• Other drought-affected areas are no longer in crisis: In some other Arid and Semi-arid lands (ASAL) areas, particularly in the northwest and in parts of the coast, conditions have returned to normal following significant off-season rainfall in recent months. However, in all ASAL counties, staple food prices remain well above normal, at a time when market dependence is high in the wake of successive poor seasons.

• Acute malnutrition: World Vision continues to respond to child malnutrition, with more than 420,000 children and nearly 37,000 pregnant and lactating women requiring treatment for acute malnutrition across the country.  Many areas continue to have Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates over the emergency threshold of 15 per cent.

• Presidential election: The country’s security situation has returned to normal after a volatile few months. Violence spiked in November in many informal settlements in Nairobi and Kisumu following the repeat presidential election held on the 26th October 2017, which was boycotted by the main opposition party.

• Access to health care services: After 150 days, the nurses’ national strike which begun in June was called off by the nurses’ union in November 2017. Nurses were ordered to resume their duties and restore health services across the country.  The strike negatively affected maternal and child health along with,  HIV and nutrition services.

• Scaling up response: In relation to the drought response interventions, the World Vision Kenya Flash Appeal has a funding gap of US $19.1M. Without additional funding,  World Vision Kenya will be unable to optimally support the drought emergency response, and mitigate the risks of a worsening situation for children.",267,"English"

Mr President,

I would like to align myself with the statement to be made later on behalf of the European Union and its member states.

Let me begin by thanking Special Representative Yamamoto, Executive Director Fedotov, and Ambassador Umarov for their comprehensive briefings. Let me also thank, in particular, Ms Wazhma Frogh, for bringing the voices of Afghan women into the chamber today.

Mr President,

The report of the Secretary-General underlines the continuing instability and volatility that affects the lives of the Afghan people on a daily basis. At the same time, as Special Representative Yamamoto has pointed out today, opportunities do exist to break the cycle of violence that has afflicted the country for four decades.

Mr President, I would like to make three points today.

Firstly, only the Afghan people, working together, will determine the future for Afghanistan. An Afghan owned and Afghan led peace process remains essential. Therefore, we welcome the Afghan government's strong commitment to engage in a political process.

The upcoming meeting in the Kabul process will be an important step towards creating an environment conducive to peace. We strongly encourage UNAMA to actively support the efforts of the Afghan government to ensure that the Kabul meetings result in a sustainable peace process.

During her visit to Afghanistan in October, the Swedish Foreign Minister met with representatives from all parts of society, and underlined the importance of an inclusive peace process. Ensuring that the whole population, meaning both men and women, can participate effectively is vital for the achievement of a sustainable peace, as is the active participation of civil society.

The regional context is important as many of the challenges facing Afghanistan cannot be dealt with in isolation. We urge all stakeholders, especially Afghanistan's neighbours, to assume responsibility and to work together towards a political settlement. There is tremendous potential in increased regional cooperation and we welcome the engagement of the central Asian states in this regard.

It is imperative for Afghanistan's future stability that parliamentary elections take place in 2018 and presidential elections in 2019, as announced, and that the elections are conducted in an inclusive, credible and transparent manner. Every effort must now be made to ensure difficulties are overcome and that elections take place.

We welcome the Secretary-General's emphasis in his report on women's participation in elections. We urge the electoral management bodies and the Afghan government to take all necessary steps to ensure women's full participation in the elections, both as voters and as candidates.

Mr President,

Secondly, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is vital to the achievement of sustainable peace. We congratulate Afghanistan on its election to the Human Rights Council. As an elected member of the Council, we expect Afghanistan to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights. We deplore the recent executions of five prisoners and urge the government to reinstate the de-facto moratorium on the death penalty, with a view to abolishing this cruel and inhumane punishment.

We appreciate the efforts of UNAMA in the area of human rights, not least pertaining to its work on children and armed conflict and civilian casualties. We encourage them to continue this important work.

Attacks against humanitarian and development workers, health-care professionals, medical transports, hospitals and other medical facilities as well as schools, continue and are deeply concerning. Such attacks not only impede efforts to aid the people of Afghanistan, but infringe the enjoyment of the right to education, health and life which are crucial in building sustainable peace. In addition, civilians continue to bear the burden of the conflict, with women and children increasingly under threat. We are deeply concerned by the increased recruitment of children by armed groups, in particular the Taliban, and call for an end to this practice.

Finally, Mr President,

I would like to reiterate our strong support for the outcome of the strategic review of UNAMA and the Secretary-General's recommendations. It is now important that these recommendations are implemented without delay. With its unique field presence, UNAMA can continue to make a tangible difference on the ground and provide important support for efforts to attain a lasting peace.

An integrated United Nations approach linking together peace, development and human rights work in Afghanistan is crucial to delivering results. Our expectations from UNAMA in this regard are high.

Mr President,

Sweden's assistance to the people of Afghanistan has remained steadfast for over three decades. Afghanistan is Sweden's single largest development cooperation partner, and our support will continue, including for reform efforts aimed at building strong and independent institutions. The Afghan people can count on our continued backing as they advance their efforts to build a peaceful, stable and inclusive future.

Thank you

2389119,"Spot Report by OSCE Observer Mission: 70th Russian convoy of 21 vehicles crossed into Ukraine and returned through the Donetsk Border Crossing Point **This report is for the general public and the media.**

**SUMMARY**

On 21 December 2017 at 06:31 (Moscow time), the seventieth[1] Russian convoy arrived at the Donetsk Border Crossing Point (BCP). A total of 21 vehicles were checked by the Russian border guards and customs services prior to their crossing into Ukraine. All 21 vehicles had crossed back into the Russian Federation by 16:39 on 21 December.

**DETAIL**

Leaving the Russian Federation

On 21 December at 06:31 the Observer Mission observed the arrival of a Russian convoy at the gate of the Donetsk BCP. A Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES) team co-ordinated and led the movements of the convoy. The convoy consisted of 16 cargo trucks and five support vehicles belonging to the MES. Except for two cargo trucks the rest bore the inscription “Humanitarian help from the Russian Federation”.

At 06:31 the vehicles entered the customs control area and queued in three lines. Once the convoy arrived, the vehicles were visually checked from the outside by the Russian Federation border guards and customs officers. The Russian MES staff rolled up/opened the tarpaulins of the trucks and the border guards and customs officials performed a visual observation from the outside.

Two service dogs were present and used by the Russian Federation border guards to check the vehicles from the outside. Four Ukrainian border guards and one customs officer were observed accompanying their Russian counterparts; they also performed a visual observation of the vehicles from the outside (without entering the trucks’ cargo space). The Ukrainian officials had clipboards in their hands and were taking notes. The Ukrainian officials were permanently escorted by two armed men in camouflage. By 07:09 all the vehicles had left the BCP towards Ukraine.

Returning to the Russian Federation

At 16:14 the convoy returned and queued in the customs area. The tarpaulins of the trucks were opened and Russian border guards and customs officers visually checked the returning convoy from the outside without the assistance of service dogs. Ukrainian representatives – four border guards – were present during this check. They also performed visual checks of the opened trucks from the outside. By 16:39 all 21 vehicles had crossed back into the Russian Federation.

 
[[1]](http://www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk/363901#_ftnref1) According to the statement of the Russian Federation officials, this convoy is considered to be the seventy-second Russian convoy which was sent to Ukraine. As two of these convoys did not cross through the “Donetsk” or “Gukovo” border crossing points, the Observer Mission did not record them. Hence, based on the Observer Mission’s counting, this convoy is considered the 70th convoy that has crossed into Ukraine.

2389114,"UN human rights experts call for perpetrators of widespread human rights violations to be brought to justice in South Sudan JUBA/ADDIS ABABA (22 December 2017) – Four years following the start of the current conflict in South Sudan, gross human rights violations continue to be committed in a widespread way by all parties to the conflict, in which civilians are bearing the brunt, says the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan* at the conclusion of a 12-day visit to the region

""The Commission welcomes yesterday's announcement made at the High Level Revitalization Forum of the Inter-Governmental Authority (IGAD) of a cessation of hostilities agreement yet remains gravely concerned over the lack of accountability for serious crimes which is fuelling impunity throughout the country,"" stated Commission Chairperson Yasmin Sooka.  ""Those responsible for this war against civilians must be stopped with the perpetrators of these horrific acts brought to justice,"" she added. 

Over the course of the Commission's visit to South Sudan, eastern Ethiopia and northern Uganda (11-22 December) Ms. Sooka and fellow Commissioner Andrew Clapham met with numerous victims of the conflict who shared harrowing accounts of indiscriminate attacks, revenge killings, torture, abduction of women and children, forced displacement, looting and burning of homes and crops, starvation, rape and other forms of sexual violence. In a country where food insecurity is acute, crops are destroyed leaving villages starving.

""We are deeply disturbed by what we witnessed and heard throughout our visit.  The deprivation and range of sexual violence are hard to describe, people are targeted and suffering just for being who they are.  The atrocities and violations are no longer just confined to a few parts of South Sudan; they are happening all across South Sudan,"" Professor Clapham stated.

While in South Sudan the Commissioners travelled to Wau, Bor and Akobo and visited Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites in Juba and Wau where individuals and families have sought protection from the violence and are provided the essentials of daily life by non-governmental organizations and humanitarian agencies.   The Commissioners met with camp leaders, elders, and women's and youth representatives.

In Wau the Commission met with an 89 nine-year-old widow who described how her husband and two sons were shot in front of her and how she too begged for her life.  Several witnesses and victims described how they were forced to flee their villages as they watched their homes burned and family and friends killed before their eyes.  A 60-year old woman told the Commission how she was gang raped by several soldiers and left for dead.

Many of the women the Commission met spoke of how they were sexually abused when their homes were attacked, often when they were collecting firewood. The Commission also heard of young men who were gang raped, often in front of family members. The Commission was also told that young men have been forced to rape relatives in front of family members.  ""Those perpetrating these crimes seem to be intent on breaking all social norms resulting in societies being torn apart,"" Ms. Sooka stated.

In Akobo, the Commission met with a number of internally displaced people who explained in great detail how they fled recent fighting in the Jonglei region and their trek of some 160 kilometers to the border town with Ethiopia, where they were now struggling to survive by eating leaves from trees and where their children were not able to attend school as they had no money for the fees.

""As another Human Rights Day passes and the world's focus shifts to other matters people here feel forgotten and are really suffering horrific violations of their rights.  The scarcity of food in many parts of the country is worrying, while incidents of rape and killing continue. The situation is really tragic,"" stated Professor Clapham. 

Equally disturbing testimonies were shared with the Commissioners during their visits with refugees in Gambella, Ethiopia and northern Uganda.  Those the Commission met with included several visibly traumatized unaccompanied minors who described the horrors and overwhelming sense of insecurity that forced them to flee the world's newest nation state. 

""I saw of lot of killing. I felt very unsafe.  I came here to escape the violence and seek a better way of life,"" recalled a 17-year boy who had just arrived at the Elegu collection point on the South Sudan-Uganda border who lost both his parents to the conflict.  Another recently arrived refugee in Gambella refugee camp in Ethiopia stated: ""I love to go back to South Sudan because it is my home country but I chose to stay here because I still want to live. There, it is either I would die of war or of starvation."" 

Refugees told the Commission that nearly everyone in South Sudan has a weapon which is now used to settle disputes resulting in the level of killings rising. A young man in the Palabek refugee camp in northern Uganda, where some 40,000 South Sudanese refugees have now settled having fled the fighting in the Pajok region in April this year, equated the vast presence of arms to a ""silent killing"".

""Civilians in South Sudan have become a football between the warring parties causing them to flee.  They have lost everything.  All they want is to be able to send their children to school, tend to their crops, feed themselves and live in peace,"" Ms. Sooka declared. 

The Commission met with humanitarians who spoke of the heightened insecurity around their work including the restrictions on access to several parts of the country obstructing humanitarian aid to those who need it most. Attacks and abductions of aid workers continue. While in Juba, the Commission sat in on the Terrain Hotel trial hearing the case concerning the rape of foreign aid workers and killing of a South Sudanese journalist in July 2016.   

The Commissioners held meetings with various Government officials, United Nations staff, members of the diplomatic community, members of the National Dialogue for South Sudan, and the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Committee(JMEC), responsible for monitoring and overseeing the implementation of the August 2015 Peace Agreement

The Commission's visit overlapped with the IGAD-led peace talks in Addis Ababa aimed to reach a solution to the conflict which began on 15 December 2013. 

""Our Commission calls for the parties to respect the agreement on the cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and humanitarian access and work towards building sustainable peace,"" Sooka stated.  ""Sustainable peace is linked to ensuring that the provisions of Chapter Five of the Peace Agreement are implemented. The Hybrid Court and the Commission on Truth, Healing and Reconciliation must be established without further delay. Justice delayed is justice denied,"" she added.

""Even if peace does come, there will need to be a lot of reconciliation,"" stated a young man from Juba, now in Kiriyandongo refugee camp in Uganda.  ""We are desperate for peace.  Please advocate for our peace and our human rights,"" he added.

The Commission is due to report to the Human Rights Council with its detailed findings in March next year.

ENDS

The Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan was established by the Human Rights Council in March 2016 and extended for one additional year in March 2017 with a mandate to determine and report the facts and circumstances of, collect and preserve evidence of, and clarify responsibility for alleged gross violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes, including sexual and gender-based violence and ethnic violence, with a view to ending impunity and providing accountability.

2389104,"Rohingya: fighting against malnutrition to save lives In Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees are living in very difficult conditions. Families do not have access to sufficient food. At the camp, our staff has opened two nutrition centres which are supervised by a doctor so that children suffering from malnutrition can be treated. Three others should open soon. At the centres, children receive high-protein food made from milk and peanut paste which quickly makes them feel better. Ivana Goretta, press attaché at Terre des hommes visited the site and shares her experiences here through photos.

“Yasmina is 4 and a half years old and is the youngest of 5 children. She says “this tastes good” to me. Her mother is relieved, this is the first time she has seen her eat for days. She heard about our centre from her community’s chief. Every morning, mothers queue up in front of the door so that their children can be treated. Once they are inside the centre we keep them for at least half an hour to be certain that their appetite comes back. A few moments later, Yasmina and her mother leave again with the 32 sachets* necessary for treating her.

Chuwaira is two years old. She is suffering from severe malnutrition. It is a relief to see her enthusiastically eating the sachet which has been given to her by Tdh’s medical team. Her big sister, 8-year old Rugada is taking good care of her and she is sitting on her lap. Chuwaira treats us to a beaming smile before leaving the centre.

In Cox’s Bazar, we train volunteers so that they can identify cases of malnutrition among children. They are Rohingya who themselves live at the camp and work alongside us. They take their responsibilities seriously and with good humour, and they can reassure families in their own languages, something which is very important.

If they are very sick, some children leave the centre with antibiotics. A Rohingya volunteer trained by Tdh carefully explains to parents how to give the medication to their children and how long the treatment lasts.

With the excellent support of the Rohingya who are living there, we are in the process of building a third nutrition centre at the Cox’s Bazar camp. More should then follow, which will allow us to greatly increase our capacity to treat malnourished children.”

The 15-day training is aimed at preparing the officers to carry out joint patrols in Gaalkacyo as part of a ceasefire agreement, brokered with help of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), United Nations and other partners.

The Gaalkacyo Ceasefire Agreement was signed on 1 January 2017 by the Puntland and Galmudug State Presidents, after months of fighting between the two administrations over the control of Gaalkacyo. Under the agreement, patrol teams from both states would be trained to help enforce the cessation of hostilities between the two administrations.

Speaking during the closure of the training, this week, Galmudug Finance Minister, Sa’ed Seed, thanked the officers for their active participation, adding that the exercise was important for the restoration of peace and co-existence between residents of the two states.

His sentiments were supported by the Puntland Military Commander, Gen. Sa’ed Hersi, who commended the trainees for their courage and commitment to serve the country and urged them to be vigilant and disciplined as they embark on joint police patrols.

Gen. Hersi commended AMISOM Police, the United Nations and development partners for their support in facilitating the training and helping in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.

Also present at the function was the Regional Governor of Puntland, Ahmed Khalif, and his counterpart from Galmudug, Abdirashid Haji. Representatives from AMISOM, UN, traditional elders and members of the civil society also attended the ceremony.

The joint patrol teams are expected to provide security to the Joint Ceasefire Committee members, while on visits to the buffer zone established between Galmudug and Puntland. The officers will also support ongoing initiatives to restore stability and the rule of law, and also act as focal points for rebuilding confidence and peace in Gaalkacyo.

2389064,"From artisanal mines to school : Akil’s moving testimony Child labour in artisanal mines and quarries in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains a major challenge. The Congolese government has committed to eradicating child labour but resources are limited to tackle a problem of this scale. No quantitative study has yet provided precise numbers of children involved, but estimates made in 2012 put the number of children working in artisanal mines at around 40,000, a large proportion of whom can be found in the copper belt of Haut-Katanga and in Lualaba Province.

The village of Luisha in Kambove territory, Haut-Katanga Province, is one of these regions where children can be found in artisanal mines. They constitute a cheap and easily exploitable workforce. Their size allows them to go down into those pits which are harder for adults to access. They also undertake the washing, sorting and transport of the minerals. This situation is a flagrant violation of international conventions on the protection of children as well as national laws.

**What Akim brought home to his family made a big difference**

Akim* is the eldest in his family. He admits to having started working in the artisanal mines due to his family’s financial situation. His parents also work in the mines, but their income is not sufficient to put food on the table for a large family with 5 children, and still less to meet their health and educational requirements.

What Akim brought home to his family therefore made a big difference to the family’s diet, even if it was far from enough to send his brothers and sisters to school. So, he set out bravely to the mines every day and worked as hard as he could to bring something home.

He was frequently ill but was always able to recover sufficiently to continue his work in the mines. He was also witness on numerous occasions to injuries suffered by colleagues of his age, who were working in the mines for the same reasons as him. Akim was soon afforded practically the same privileges as the adults, which deprived him of his right to a childhood.

**A future still accessible**

Akim still had dreams, however. He hoped to return to school  and become a doctor ! Thanks to the UNICEF’s intervention, Akim seems to be getting closer to his dream : he left the mines and is enrolled in a community school.

To ensure that his education would continue long term, his parents were invited to join other parents in forming associations which would work in concert with the Community Child Protection Network (RECOPE). They grow maize and undertake market gardening on 3 of the 100 hectares of ground provided to them by local authorities.

Thanks to this, Akim’s parents have been able to continue paying his school fees, and also enrol the other children in school ! They are still working in the artisanal mines, but are happy that their children are able to escape what they describe as hellish work.

Akim is extremely happy but is troubled to know that lots of his young compatriots are still in the mines in Luisha . He asks for the intervention of the Government, of significant figures in civil society and of the mining companies, so that the children of Luisha can quit the mines and go to school !

Everyone has a dream and everyone has the right to their dream

**UNICEF’s work in the mines in Katagna**

UNICEF  DRC promotes the protection of children in Haut-Katanga Province through the strengthening of protective mechanisms in the community. While putting a strong emphasis on children working in the mines due to the distinctive characteristics of the area, these protective mechanisms in the community allow for various child protection issues to be addressed in this region: violence against children, birth registrations, child marriages, child trafficking, sexual abuse, etc.

2389059,"Australia must secure solutions for refugees abandoned on Manus Island *This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Cécile Pouilly – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.*

In light of the continued perilous situation on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island for refugees and asylum seekers abandoned by Australia, UNHCR has called again this week on the Australian government live up to its responsibilities and urgently find humane and appropriate solutions.

Since the closure of Australia’s “offshore processing” facility on 31 October, approximately 800 refugees and asylum seekers have remained in a precarious situation. Some 700 are now accommodated in the three sites: East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre, West Lorengau Haus and Hillside Haus. Over the past four weeks, at least five security incidents have been reported by refugees and asylum seekers, security personnel, local police, and members of the local community.

The most serious incident occurred on the night of 10 December when three people armed with machetes and an axe attempted to force their way into West Lorengau Haus, where 150 refugees and asylum seekers were being accommodated. They were ultimately stopped from causing serious harm by security staff. The same group then walked to nearby Hillside Haus where two of them, armed with a baton and a knife, entered unimpeded by security staff, and yelled that refugees and asylum seekers should leave. Police on Manus Island are looking into these incidents.

The forced removal of refugees and asylum seekers on 22 November from the now decommissioned Australian facility has inflicted further trauma on people who have already suffered greatly - violence and persecution in their own country followed by four years in detention on Manus Island.

The cessation of critical services including the support for victims of torture and trauma has only added to the harshness. Such support is vital for those with acute needs.

A recent medical report commissioned by UNHCR also showed that the cumulative effect of uncertainty about the future, the lack of prospects for solutions, cessation of services, substandard living and hygiene conditions, and inadequate medical care poses a growing risk of deteriorating physical and mental health, violence, and self-harm among refugees and asylum seekers on Manus. The report also noted the obvious strain that is being placed on the host community and local resources, especially on the health system and hospital.

UNHCR reiterated its call this week on the Australian authorities to secure long term solutions for all refugees and asylum seekers whom Australia has forcibly transferred to Papua New Guinea and Nauru, and to permanently settle those refugees who have already been transferred to Australia on medical or other grounds.

2389049,"Fresh Congo violence fuels displacement to Uganda *This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Cécile Pouilly – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.*

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is witnessing a sharp rise in the number of people from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) seeking safety in Uganda.

More than 2,650 refugees have crossed the border this week, fleeing fresh violence in DRC’s Ituri province – five times the usual number of arrivals. Most of them are women and children.

The majority of refugees cross Lake Albert on rickety fishing vessels to arrive to Sebagoro, a village some 270 kilometres northwest of the Ugandan capital Kampala. About 650 refugees arrived in two boats this morning, carrying valuable belongings such as motorbikes and livestock. 

This route is being used by a large number of refugees for the first time after a tragic shipwreck in 2014 that left over 200 dead.

The new arrivals to Uganda are reportedly fleeing intercommunal violence at Djugu territory. Since Monday, there were reports of houses being scorched in the area, and people attacked with machetes and firearms.

More than 20 villages were abandoned due to the fear of reprisals. Services have been paralysed and panic engulfed the population.

Refugees report that many more people are gathering on the Congolese side of Lake Albert waiting for their turn to cross, despite the journey’s high cost.

Inside Uganda, UNHCR is stepping up its capacity to meet the refugees’ needs. We are supporting the authorities to receive the new arrivals and transfer them to Kyangwali settlement, some 50 kilometers to the east. There, refugees are registered, medically screened and provided with hot meals and basic relief items.

UNHCR works in the settlement to identify and assist persons with specific needs, including unaccompanied and separated children, survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, pregnant women and persons with disabilities.

However, with UNHCR’s operation in Uganda funded only by 39 per cent, more resources are urgently needed to upgrade the reception capacity and assist the new arrivals. This is particularly important, given that Uganda already hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa – some 1,4 million overall.

Among them, the number of Congolese reaches 231,500. Most have fled violence in North Kivu, a region plagued by chronic instability in DRC’s east.

In total, the number of Congolese refugees in neighboring countries has increased by almost 100,000 people in the space of one year, reaching over 623,000 by end November.

In their majority, Congolese refugees are hosted in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, with significant flows occurring during 2017 to Angola and Zambia. Refugees add to some 4,1 million internally displaced Congolese, rendering DRC the country with the highest number of displaced people in Africa.

2389029,"More speed needed to help refugees stranded in Greek islands *UNHCR moves a dozen families from soggy tents at Lesvos reception centre to hotels, but transfers to the mainland need to speed up as conditions deteriorate.*

By UNHCR Staff  |  22 December 2017

LESVOS, Greece – Syrian refugee Sibel* lived for three months in a small, damp tent in the hills of Lesvos, with her three children and teenage nephew, buffeted by winter winds and rain as she sought asylum.

Her youngest daughter, seven -year-old Ran, has been sick with a bowel problem and has been recovering from colostomy procedures. But in the unsanitary conditions at the Moria reception centre, with little access to running water, it has been difficult to care for her.

But yesterday (December 21) she was among a dozen families, 59 people, moved by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, from soggy tents there to hotel rooms hired for the most vulnerable on the Greek island.

“Now I will be able to bathe her with hot water,” Sibel told UNHCR as she boarded a chartered bus to take her out of Moria.

UNHCR remains very concerned at the situation of refugees and migrants on the Greek Aegean islands, in particular Lesvos, Chios and Samos. In this context, UNHCR welcomes important efforts to speed up transfers to the mainland over the past weeks.

Since mid-October, some 6,000 asylum seekers have been moved by the Greek government out of the islands with UNHCR’s support. This is among efforts being taken to ease conditions in overcrowded reception centres, and transfer the more vulnerable to safety as winter sets in.

However, some 10,000 asylum seekers are still crammed into government-run facilities on the islands, double the design capacity. Addressing reporters at a news briefing in Geneva, UNHCR spokesperson Cécile Pouilly said the situation continues to be critical in the reception centres of Moria on Lesvos and Vathy on Samos.

“Time is of the essence and the accelerated pace of departures for asylum seekers authorized to move should be maintained,” she told reporters at the Palais des Nations on Friday (December 22).

“UNHCR is calling on the Government to continue easing pressure on Lesvos, Chios and Samos, by further shortening procedures for people eligible to move, and urgently improving conditions for those who continue to stay.

The camp is strewn with garbage and dotted with home-made shelters, which are little proof against winter rains and falling temperatures.

Pouilly said that the current restrictions which keep people on the islands need to be reviewed to allow for the quick transfer from Reception and Identification Centres, or RICs, of vulnerable asylum seekers and others who could continue the asylum procedure on the mainland.

Tension in the RICs and on the islands has been mounting since the summer when the number of arrivals began rising. This coincided with the government taking over responsibility for infrastructure and services in the RICs, facing problems that still need to be addressed.

In some cases, local authorities have opposed efforts to introduce improvements inside of the RICs. On some islands, local reluctance has also hampered efforts to secure small numbers of temporary and exceptional accommodation in apartments and hotels for the most vulnerable.

“We hope that these problems can be quickly solved and that people staying in the RICs can access warmer and safer conditions with adequate shelter, electricity and functioning water and sanitation facilities,” Pouilly said.

In light of the difficult situation on several islands, UNHCR since October has handed over some 240,000 relief items to authorities to improve the situation at reception centres, including winter kits, blankets, and sleeping bags. We have also recently installed 18 accommodation units in the Kara Tepe site, which is managed by the Municipality of Lesvos, in addition to 242 installed earlier this year.

More than 1,700 people have reached the Greek Aegean islands so far in December, continuing a trend of higher arrivals – some 19,800 since July this year. This includes large numbers of families and many people needing specific support. Over 70 per cent of all arrivals this year were Syrian, Iraqi or Afghan, and four out of ten were children.

Meanwhile, mayors of towns and cities taking part in the UNHCR accommodation programme on the mainland gave their firm support at a landmark conference in Athens last week for the continuation of the scheme beyond 2018. UNHCR is meeting the goal of 22,000 places in the urban accommodation programme by the end of the year.

Through this Operations Update, Ethiopia Red Cross Society (ERCS) seeks to extend the operational timeframe by an additional two months (New end date: 23 February 2018) to enable completion of procurement of Emergency Shelter/NFI kits. ERCS also seeks approval to reallocate 27,773.41Swiss francs planned for the “Inception workshop”, “monitoring and distribution” and “transportation” budget lines to offset the projected over expenditure under ES/NFI procurement caused by increase in prices on the local market. 

It should be highlighted that the assistance to beneficiaries has been provided using NS pre-positioned stocks and the pending procurements will enable the ERCS to replenish the distributed items. The first activity which is not done as per the plan is the inception workshop which was planned to be conducted in Oromia and Afar regions. The planned inception workshop was not conducted since ERCS directly conducted the distribution considering the urgency of the need for ES/NFIs for the displaced people. 

**A. Situation analysis**

*Description of the disaster* 

In Ethiopia, rainfall attributed to the Kiremt rains, which began on 8 September 2017 has led to extensive flooding. The Ambeira zone in Afar region, and special zones surrounding Addis Ababa (the capital), Jima, South-east Shewa, and South-west Shewa in the Oromia region have been worst affected by the rains and flooding. It is estimated that a total of 18,628 households (HHs) (93,140 people) have been affected, of which 7,270 HHs (36,350 people) have been displaced.

In the background of the recent floods, the situation has been complicated further by an escalation in the civil unrest along the Oromo and Somali border, which stretches more than 1,000km. Ethnic clashes have led to the displacement of more than 45,000 HHs (225,000 people) from Oromia and Somali regions, including into the neighbouring Hareri region. The floods and conflict has affected in the same areas in Oromia and Somali regions therefore creating a complex situation",267,"English"

2388929,"Finland will increase its humanitarian aid for Yemen and the crises in Africa **Press release 226/2017**   
19 December 2017

Finland will assist areas suffering from conflicts and drought in Yemen, Northeast Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia.

“The focus in our aid decisions towards the end of the year is on crises where the need is currently particularly great and aid is needed urgently”, says Kai Mykkänen, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development.

Millions of people in Yemen, which suffers from war, depend on international aid. Almost one million people have caught cholera after last spring, and the country now faces the worst famine for decades. Finland will direct a total of EUR 2.5 million to Yemen through the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR (EUR 1.5 million) and the World Food Programme WFP (EUR 1 million).

More aid will also be granted for the acute crises in Africa. Finland will support Northeast Nigeria with EUR 1.5 million through the UNHCR. In addition, EUR 750,000 will be directed to Ethiopia through the WFP and EUR 1 million to the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Congo, as many as 3.8 million people have had to flee from conflicts and currently the country has one of the fastest growing humanitarian crises in the world.

In addition, Finland will grant EUR 8 million of general aid for the WFP. The WFP can flexibly decide on allocating general aid, which often improves the cost-efficiency and speed of the aid.

With the new aid, the amount of humanitarian aid that Finland has granted in 2017 will total EUR 81.3 million. Approximately one third of this is general aid, one third directed to humanitarian action in the Middle East and slightly less than one third to Africa. In addition, Finland has supported humanitarian work in Afghanistan, Myanmar, North Korea and Ukraine.

Among other things, in thematic issues, Finland has hosted a conference on aid to Syria and promoted the position of the disabled in humanitarian action and the development of flexible forms of funding during this year.

The humanitarian situation in the world has deteriorated during 2017. According to the UN’s recent estimates, 136 million people are now in need of humanitarian aid and protection. In spite of the ever-growing need, more aid has been delivered this year than ever before, which has saved millions of lives in different parts of the world.

At the centre, data experts and humanitarians will work together to process and visualize data to rapidly gain insight into the needs of affected people and the response by humanitarian partners. Partners will develop and promote data policies, for example to ensure that sensitive data is protected, and offer training in data skills.

The centre is established and managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and is supported by the Government of the Netherlands. It is part of The Hague Humanity Hub, an open, collaborative work environment established by the city.

“OCHA’s new Centre for Humanitarian Data is a signpost to the future. It shows how the technologies that are revolutionizing every aspect of our lives can be harnessed to help and support vulnerable people all over the world,” said the Secretary-General. “This centre will help humanitarians to make informed and responsible decisions to meet people’s most urgent needs.”

The centre will manage the Humanitarian Data Exchange, OCHA’s open platform for accessing, sharing and using data from hundreds of organizations and dozens of humanitarian emergencies such as Yemen, Somalia and the Rohingya refugee crisis. The aim is to speed up the flow of data from collection to use so that aid groups will have access to timely information about often rapidly evolving situations.

Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Sigrid Kaag, welcomed the opening of the Centre: “We want innovation to change and improve aid to people most heavily affected by conflicts or natural disasters. The innovative Centre for Humanitarian Data helps us achieve that change. Institutional data sharing agreements, data standards adoption and technical integration enables essential data to move faster across partner systems and accomplish a more efficient and, equally important, more inclusive aid system in which no one is left behind.”

2388834,"Sri Lanka / Dengue Emergency Plan of Action operation update n° 3 (MDRLK007) **A. Situation analysis**

*Description of the disaster*

Sri Lanka has been facing an unprecedented outbreak of Dengue fever. Sri Lanka is a tropical country with two monsoon seasons. With each monsoon brings in two peaks of Dengue fever making it an endemic disease in Sri Lanka. However, 2017 started with an exceptionally high number of Dengue cases which shot up to an outbreak in May-June 2017, creating the largest Dengue outbreak experienced by the country for last three decades.

During the last 11 months of 2017, a total of 174,889 suspected Dengue cases have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Sri Lanka with over 320 deaths.  
Approximately 41.93 per cent of Dengue cases were reported from the Western province. The highest numbers of Dengue cases were reported during the 29th week of 2017. All four Virus types of Dengue have been seen in Sri Lanka. The current outbreak is predominantly due to Dengue Fever Virus Type 2 (DEN-2), which is not the usual type circulating in Sri Lanka. According to the WHO, this is a 4.3-fold higher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016. 

Monthly reported Dengue cases are varied depending on the rains received. In July 2017 the highest number of Dengue cases was reported where 23 per cent of the total Dengue cases reported.  
Presently it can be seen that there is a reduction in Dengue cases reported; 5 per cent in the month of November 2017.

It is expected that the country will face another outbreak after the monsoon rains in months of January and February 2018. However, Dengue cases are emerging in districts where the present outbreak was not previously reported. Historical data shows that there are always two peaks of Dengue incidence in Sri Lanka. One during Southwest monsoons and another during Northeast monsoons. Analysis of the data on the present outbreak shows the incidence of Dengue is getting higher in eastern province and districts adjoining to western province. Especially with the commencement of the North-Eastern monsoons, there is a risk of Dengue outbreaks in more districts. The MoH had requested from SLRCS with a second letter dated 11 September 2017 to scale up the activities at community level.

Since the schools have been considered as a hot spot for Dengue in Sri Lanka and are closed in the month of December. Considering there is trend of outbreak in January and February, SLRCS requested for one month extension till 28 February 2018, to allow sufficient time to complete the school awareness activities and to conduct public awareness public education (PAPE) on Dengue prevention via mainstream media. The plan of action is attached at the end of this DREF operation update.",267,"English"

2388754,"Latest clashes highlight fragility of South Sudan ceasefire deal As South Sudan's warring parties haggled over a ceasefire deal this week, dozens of refugees streamed into neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, fleeing what they said was a fresh government offensive.

The apparent push to recapture the key rebel stronghold of Lasu came as mediators tabled a ceasefire agreement in Addis Ababa, which was signed by major parties to the four year conflict on Thursday and is to go into force on December 24.

**Lasu attack**

However, with South Sudanese rebel forces vowing to take back their stronghold of Lasu in Central Equatoria State — regardless of the ceasefire — the fragility of the deal was thrown into stark relief.

""I'm not sure the government wants peace. If they wanted peace, why would they attack Lasu so that we have to run again with our children,"" said Betty Moriba, a 28-year-old mother of five.

Having fled violence twice before, Moriba grabbed her children at the first sound of gunfire and ran towards the DRC, but was unable to salvage any of the family's prized possessions.

**Related Content** [S. Sudan warring parties agree ceasefire  – AU chair](http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/South-Sudan-warring-parties-agree-ceasefire-AU-chair-/2558-4238232-th3qvfz/index.html)

She and other witnesses say President Salva Kiir's troops attacked Lasu on Sunday, which has served as the headquarters for the Riek Machar's SPLA-IO, the main opposition movement in South Sudan. ""They came with armoured vehicles and machine-gun-mounted pick up trucks,"" SPLA-IO spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told AFP over the phone from Kampala.

Gabriel said the two sides fought each other for several hours on Monday morning before the rebels withdrew. He has vowed to launch a counter-offensive if government forces do not pull out.

Army spokesman Santo Domic Chol denied troops had launched an offensive on the town, accusing the rebels of attacking a government position as well as looting a village for food — forcing troops to step in to save civilians.

""We have been ordered not to engage hostilities by pursuing rebels (but) at times we will fight if we are attacked in our positions which is what happened in Lasu.""

However it was unclear what government position he was referring to — as both civilians and an official document released earlier this month indicated the area was under rebel control.

""These government soldiers came from Yei and they were shooting guns and killing people. That's what made us come this way,"" said James Mana, one of the fresh arrivals in the DRC, near the town of Aba.

Congolese authorities registered more than 200 refugees in the last five days.

Smoke could be seen rising from a village across the border.

**'Cost and consequences'**

South Sudan this month entered into its fifth year of a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and driven nearly four million from their homes.

The UN Security Council warned last week that there would be ""cost and consequences"" for any side who blocks ""last chance"" peace efforts mediated by the regional authority IGAD, in a bid to revitalise a shattered peace agreement.

The peace deal was signed in 2015 to end 21 months of civil war between Kiir's government and Machar's rebels which broke out just two years after independence in 2011.

However the deal effectively collapsed in July 2016, when fresh fighting in the capital Juba forced then-first vice president Machar out of the country and his supporters back to battling the government in the bush.

Violence spread to the southern region of Equatoria, forcing over a million people to flock to neighbouring Uganda and the DRC in what has become the biggest refugee crisis on the continent.

In addition to Kiir's government and Machar's SPLA-IO, this round of peace talks also includes half a dozen armed opposition groups that have sprung up since July 2016, a factor that is likely to further complicate negotiations.

A permanent ceasefire is the first step in negotiations to include a ""revised and realistic"" timeline to holding elections.

However after numerous failed ceasefires and collapsed peace deals, observers are sceptical.

""The regime is clearly not interested in negotiations or compromise and is the principle obstacle to peace,"" said Payton Knopf, the head of the South Sudan working group at the US Institute for Peace and former coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on South Sudan.

**Systematic attacks**

Rights groups have blamed the government for systematic attacks on civilians in Equatoria, including killings, torture and rape.

As a result, many have sought shelter behind rebel lines, offering opposition fighters food in return for protection. But over the past couple of months, there have also been growing allegations of abuses at the hands of the SPLA-IO, gradually eroding popular support for the rebellion.

For the rebels, weakened by lack of ammunition and infighting, the loss of Lasu is just the latest in a series of military setbacks.

Civilians like Betty Moriba see little point in returning to South Sudan.

""I just want to be in one place, where I can raise my children,"" she said. ""I just don't want to run anymore.""",267,"English"
2388729,"Statement of the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union on the Revitalisation Process of the South Sudan Peace Agreement Addis Abeba, 21 December 2017: The Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, Moussa Faki Mahamat, welcomes the signing by the South Sudanese parties of an Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access, as part of the IGAD-led Revitalization Forum that opened in Addis Ababa on 17 December 2017.

Today’s Agreement marks a critical first step in the efforts to end the senseless conflict and carnage that has been unfolding in South Sudan since December 2013. While welcoming this first step, the Chairperson of the Commission stresses that the true test of the genuineness of the parties’ professed commitments lies in the full and effective implementation of their pledge to end violence and uphold the most basic tenets of international humanitarian law.

The people of South Sudan, who have endured so much pain and suffering, are investing great expectation in the faithful implementation of this Agreement. They desperately need and deserve respite from war, especially as they enter this festive Christmas season, and look with rekindled hope towards the New Year.

The Chairperson of the Commission therefore urges the South Sudanese stakeholders to deliver on the commitments made. They should build on this important achievement and continue to make the necessary compromises without which the revitalization process cannot succeed.

The Chairperson of the Commission seizes this opportunity to reiterate the African Union appreciation to IGAD and the Heads of State and Government of the region, for their commitment and steadfastness. Their continued leadership is critical to take forward the peace process. The Chairperson also commends IGAD Special Envoy Ismail Wais, as well as former Foreign Ministers Georges Chicoti of Angola, Hanna Tetteh of Ghana and Ramtane Lamamra of Algeria, who served as Facilitators.",267,"English"
2388714,"South Sudan’s pilot Message Library of critical information for disaster affected communities is ready for use in emergencies **Walter Mawere**

SMILE Again Africa Development Organization (SAADO) has developed a searchable message database that can be used to disseminate critical information to affected populations during emergencies in South Sudan.

This follows demand for effective two-way communication between vulnerable communities and humanitarian responders. The information is intended to promote effective humanitarian aid delivery and accountability to the vulnerable communities.

In its current state, the searchable pilot concentrates on only three hazards around South Sudan and has critical information that can be disseminated to respective affected populations as awareness, alert or self-care messages. The three hazards are drought and famine; malaria and measles; landmines and explosives and GBV in addition to some harmful traditional practices.

The process of coming up with the messages included selection of the messages with input from all relevant stakeholders, especially the clusters; translation of the messages into various local languages, namely; Juba Arabic, Dinka and Nuer, respective of area of dissemination; trial dissemination of the messages through various channels to identify the most effective channels; and data collection exercise in which surveys were conducted in areas where the messages are disseminated in Juba and the Protection of Civilians site.

Communities were strongly involved in drafting the messages and suggesting suitable channels of dissemination. Through focus discussions and one on one interview, communities helped in translating the messages and also advising on the channels they trust and which would reach them more.

“The pilot message library is meant to harmonise information dissemination by humanitarian actors in South Sudan, we want to make sure that information is readily available in times of emergencies,” said SAADO Communications Manager Walter Mawere. Stakeholders have welcomed the online platform and called for its scaling up highlighting that it is very helpful in emergency response.

The South Sudan government through the ministries of Education, Health and the South Sudan Mines Authority was extensively involved in the process to come up with a searchable message database. This was to ensure that the messages are safe for dissemination, objective, culturally sensitive and within the context of South Sudan before it is made available for mass consumption.

The Message Library is hosted on the CDAC Network website which you can visit [here.](http://www.cdacnetwork.org/tools-and-resources/message-library/south-sudan/)

*SAADO, with support from DFID, has also developed an accompanying user’s guide, an easy to read document aimed at giving assistance to individuals who intend to use the Message Library to disseminate messages in areas of South Sudan. This can be downloaded below.*

**Private sector accompanies Relief Chief to drought-stricken Kenyan county**
 
A United Nations team led by the Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien, government officials and HPPP chair [Equity Bank](http://equitybankgroup.com/) visited the remote village of Bandarero in Moyale, Marsabit County on March 4 to assess and [raise awareness of the effects of drought.](http://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-flash-appeal-2017)

Many of the families they met said they had little access to water, their livestock had perished, and their children were struggling to stay in school.

“I am here to say that the international community stands with you, and together we will get through these difficult times. We must act early, together, now,” O’Brien told affected families.

The delegation witnessed firsthand the transfer payment system used to dispense cash to drought-affected communities through the support of Equity Bank in collaboration with the [National Drought Management Authority.](http://www.ndma.go.ke/)

The [Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP)](http://www.hsnp.or.ke/) is active in 4 counties - Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera - and targets 68,000 people.

**Equity Bank supports cash transfers of KSH 234 million to drought-hit Kenyans**

On 12 March 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta underscored the importance of public-private partnerships in the mitigation of the impacts of drought on communities living in arid and semi arid areas in northern Kenya.

Presiding over the announcement that Equity Bank would disburse KSH 234 million to vulnerable households on behalf of the Government of Kenya, President Kenyatta noted that cash transfers offer recipients choices. “This will improve living standards for communities living in the arid and semi-arid lands,” he said.

The British High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey lauded Equity Bank’s role in identifying and making payments to beneficiaries through the use of biometric technology. “Instead of donors deciding what is good for people, people are deciding what is good for themselves, whether they want to add on to their livestock numbers or start a small business to sustain their families. This is improving inclusion across Turkana,” he said.

The Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) is a cash transfer programme designed for the extremely poor in the counties of Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera. It is managed by the National Drought Management Authority under the Ministry of Devolution and Planning. The programme provides regular and emergency cash transfers to communities severely affected by drought. It is funded by the Government of Kenya, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and Australian Aid.

Equity Bank disburses cash transfers to vulnerable families in remote areas. The Bank has engaged GPRS and VSAT technologies to ensure the cash is distributed. HSNP's Equity Bank payment system has proven to be effective, efficient and transparent.

Thuraya: Communicating for credible elections & effective water management


From restoring critical communications during and after natural disasters to coordinating emergency response, satellite technology often serves as the backbone to successful relief and support operations. Relief agencies are increasingly reliant on mobile satellite services (MSS) for their robustness and wide coverage to facilitate a timely and efficient humanitarian response.

**Communicating for credible elections**

Thuraya SatSleeve + and XT-PRO handsets are used to share and monitor fair election results over satellite communications. In East Africa, Thuraya is part of the HPPP’s Election Preparedness/ Contingency Working Group.

During Kenya's 2016 by-elections, Thuraya was contacted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the regulatory agency responsible for conducting and supervising referenda and elections. They needed to achieve full and immediate transmission of results, because a delay in the confirmation of election results and declaration of winners raises concerns over the credibility of the electoral process. Four by-elections were being held in county assembly wards that had limited or no terrestrial coverage.

A joint team from Thuraya and Airtel Africa created a 14-day support programme. IEBC election officers participated in training and a results simulation exercise. Thuraya also provided technical support on election day.

The results were comprehensive: Thuraya was able to confirm 100% transmission results from remote county assembly wards using Thuraya handsets, enhancing the credibility of the electoral process.

Monitoring groundwater for effective drought response
To manage water scarcity in communities affected by drought, Thuraya works through various system integrators, using robust and secure M2M two-way communication terminals and services.

The Thuraya M2M FT-2225 terminal connects to water sensors that send data updates in real time to water management platforms over Thuraya’s  satellites. This helps experts collect and analyze data with the goal of monitoring and controlling ground water levels for effective resource management in regions such as Africa and the Middle East.",267,"English"
2388689,"Syria/Russia: Airstrikes, Siege Killing Civilians **Allow Urgent Aid into Besieged Eastern Ghouta and End Indiscriminate Attacks**

(Beirut) – [Syrian](https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/syria) government and [Russian](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia) forces have escalated their airstrikes on Eastern Ghouta, a suburb approximately 15 kilometers from the center of Syria’s capital Damascus, killing dozens of civilians in apparently unlawful attacks, Human Rights Watch said today. Syrian forces have tightened their siege of the enclave, held by anti-government armed groups, severely restricting humanitarian aid in violation of the laws of war and preventing civilians from leaving the area.  
The UN Security Council, which on December 19, 2017, renewed its mandate for cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid to millions of desperate Syrian civilians, should demand that the Syrian government immediately end unlawful restrictions on aid to Eastern Ghouta or face targeted sanctions against those responsible.

“The world is silently looking on as Russia and Syria tighten the noose around the suffering population of Eastern Ghouta with unlawful strikes, widely-banned weapons, and a devastating siege,” said [Lama Fakih](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/lama-fakih), deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “The Security Council should demand that Syria immediately end its tactics that are starving the population, preventing civilians from leaving, and denying humanitarian aid.”

Human Rights Watch in November and December spoke remotely with 12 residents, humanitarian workers, and doctors in Eastern Ghouta concerning alliance airstrikes and restrictions on humanitarian aid.

Syrian government forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta, which has a population of about 400,000, since 2013. In October 2017, the government restricted the use of the al-Wafideen crossing, the only entry point for commercial merchandise, depleting scarce food and medical supplies and causing prices to skyrocket.

From November 14 to November 30, the Russian-Syrian joint military operation conducted more than 400 airstrikes on Eastern Ghouta, according to the Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer group that works in anti-government areas, and [the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights](http://www.syriahr.com/2017/12/05/%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%A1%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D8%B9%D9%82/). The Russian-Syrian alliance struck more than half the towns in the besieged enclave at least once during this period, according to local media monitors. Homes, a makeshift school, and a public market were among the civilian structures hit.

Human Rights Watch documented three aerial attacks in Eastern Ghouta since November 14 that were apparently indiscriminate, in violation of the laws of war. One incident involved the use of cluster munitions, widely banned weapons that are inherently indiscriminate. These three attacks caused the death of at least 23 civilians and wounded many others.

The threat to civilians from the intensified aerial campaign has been exacerbated by lack of access to medical care and essential foodstuffs, Human Rights Watch said. The air and ground attacks and siege have together resulted in the deaths of at least 190 civilians, including 51 children, between November 14 and 30, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.

Anas al-Ta’an, a local resident, told Human Rights Watch: “We don’t know whether to hide in the basement from the strikes, or risk it to stand in line for two hours in the hopes of getting bread for our children. This is the choice we make, and the situation is beyond tragic.”

The laws of war do not prohibit sieges so long as the harm to the civilian population does not exceed the expected military gain, starvation is not used as a method of warfare, and humanitarian aid delivery is not hindered.

Syrian forces have severely restricted the entry of essential food and medicines and the exit of civilians from Eastern Ghouta in violation of the laws of war, Human Rights Watch said. Entry of humanitarian aid through UN convoys has been extremely limited, with the Syrian government only granting permission to the UN to enter a handful of times over the past year. While a besieging force may prevent the entry of weapons and food and other supplies destined for opposing armies, essential goods for civilians must be allowed.

A UN official told Human Rights Watch, “the government systematically rejects life-saving medicines and medical equipment.” The UN [estimates](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-74) that aid reached only a quarter of the besieged population in Eastern Ghouta in 2017.

The government has also unnecessarily hindered the evacuation of people with urgent medical needs, Human Rights Watch said. [The UN said](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/joint-press-stakeout-un-special-envoy-syria-staffan-de-mistura-and-un-1) that close to 500 people require immediate medical evacuation and that at least 10 people have died since June while awaiting Syrian government permission to leave Eastern Ghouta for treatment elsewhere. UNICEF, the UN children’s agency, reported in December that 137 children, ages 7 months to 17 years, needed immediate medical evacuation.

The escalating airstrikes and tightening of the siege in November meant hospitals were over capacity, lacking necessary medical supplies, and doctors were overwhelmed. “There was a child, Osama Al-Tukhi, he was 5 years old and he died of a brain infection,” a representative of a medical facility in Eastern Ghouta told Human Rights Watch “We could have saved him. He only needed an antiviral shot that is easily attainable in any Damascus pharmacy, but not here.”

Infighting among anti-government armed factions and restrictions on freedom of movement within the enclave have contributed to worsening humanitarian conditions, Human Rights Watch said. Anti-government armed groups should allow unimpeded humanitarian access and movement of civilians away from areas of hostilities, Human Rights Watch said.

In December, local media reported that negotiations were ongoing between the Russian and Syrian governments and non-state armed groups operating in Eastern Ghouta for the evacuation of the armed group Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham, previously Jabhat al-Nusra, from the besieged enclave. Any agreement should be consistent with laws-of-war protections for both civilians who evacuate and those who remain behind, and should ensure delivery of humanitarian aid to populations in need, Human Rights Watch said.

“Russia will have a difficult time bringing Syrians together in Sochi if it is indiscriminately bombing civilians while allowing its ally, the Syrian government, to continue its increasingly deadly siege of Eastern Ghouta,” Fakih said. “At the very least, it should pressure the Syrian government to allow humanitarian aid and evacuate urgent medical cases.”

**The Besieged Enclave**

The besieged enclave of Eastern Ghouta, east of Damascus, is covered by a July de-escalation [agreement](http://tass.com/world/957354) between Russia, the Syrian government, and Syrian anti-government groups, that calls for a ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Syrian state media reported that Syrian government military operations against the enclave were in response to an [attack](http://aldorars.com/en/news/2692) on November 14 by the anti-government armed groups [Faylaq al-Rahman and Ahrar al-Sham](https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-restarts-operation-expel-ahrar-al-sham-east-damascus-suburb/) on a strategic objective, the Vehicles Administration Center, near the town of Harasta. The Russian government [stated](http://tass.com/politics/977790) that the alliance attacks in Eastern Ghouta since November 14 have been targeting Islamic State (also known as ISIS) forces.

Seven people in Eastern Ghouta told Human Rights Watch that Russian-Syrian alliance airstrikes were not limited to Hasrata, where clashes were occurring, or areas where fighters were based, but extended to densely populated areas with no evident military objectives. In the three November airstrikes that Human Rights Watch documented, witness accounts and a review of video and photographs of the strikes gave no indication of any military objective in the vicinity.

Non-state armed groups in Eastern Ghouta have also shelled neighboring government-held areas using mortars, causing civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure, [according](http://www.sana.sy/?p=671835) to pro-government media sources. Attacks using indiscriminate weapons in populated areas violate the laws of war.

Ahmed Hamdan, a local working in media in Eastern Ghouta, said: “There is no way for us, regular people, to identify why we were hit or where we will be hit next. There is no place that we can say, ‘Oh, if I stay away from this area, I will be safe.’ Nowhere is safe.”

**Three Unlawful Airstrikes**

Human Rights Watch documented three apparently unlawful airstrikes in Hamouriyeh and Irbin in Eastern Ghouta in November and early December. While Human Rights Watch has not been able to determine whether the attacks were carried out by Russian or Syrian aircraft, only Russian and Syrian forces have been conducting airstrikes in the area. But responsibility for an unlawful airstrike does not rest solely with the aircraft or weapon used. All those taking part in the attack, including at the command level, may bear legal responsibility. The laws of war require all government forces involved in an apparently unlawful attack to carry out a credible and impartial investigation of the episode.

**Hamouriyeh**

Four local residents said that Russian-Syrian alliance aircraft have struck the town of Hamouriyeh, seven kilometers from Damascus, several times since November 14. Hamouriyeh is a densely populated, primarily residential town located near the center of the besieged enclave. It is under the control of the anti-government armed group Faylaq al-Rahman.

On November 19, between 5:30 and 6 p.m., Russian or Syrian aircraft struck Hamouriyeh with cluster munitions three times, according to three residents and online reports. The residents saw the aircraft as it circled above the town. One said that the strikes occurred on Hamouriyeh Square and near Hayjat Street, both residential areas. Available information indicates that the three strikes were with inherently indiscriminate cluster munitions.

A civilian photographer who accompanied a Syria Civil Defense ambulance to the site of the second attack, said that when the driver, Alaa al-Din Juha, stepped out of the car, he set off an unexploded submunition, killing him. Two videos appear to show the [explosion of the submunition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXV9V8UgZhM) and al-Din Juha’s [body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALGTzleJQ4Y) next to the Syria Civil Defense ambulance.

Another civilian, Abdo Yassin, died the next day from injuries sustained in the attack, the witnesses said.

The three residents said they were unaware of any military forces in the area struck, which was far from the front lines. Hamouriyeh is three kilometers from the nearest front line.

On December 3, two airstrikes hit between noon and 1 p.m., according to four residents who heard the plane before the strikes. The first strike hit the road in a residential area between Hamouriyeh and Irbin, near a medical facility called the Balsam Center. Ahmad Hamdan, a local media activist who photographed the damage, said that a rocket lodged deep in the concrete of the road and exploded:

I saw six who were dead immediately. The rocket fell in the middle of the road, it created a big hole. The diameter was about 1.4 meters. It went into the concrete and the explosion was huge. There were no remnants; the explosion was significant. There was a steel [iron] door to one of the residential buildings, which was heavily dented.

The second airstrike, approximately half an hour later, contained three munitions, according to three residents. Nibras Hamuriyeh, who lives across the street from where the munitions struck, said that he saw three munitions hit his neighborhood from a plane while he was on the street heading home. He ran home, which was right across the street from one of the strikes, to find the doors and windows broken, and his wife and children crying – “but thankfully unharmed.”

Two other munitions struck the roofs of buildings, Hamuriyeh said. He said that the strike killed his uncle and two adult male cousins who lived in one of the buildings. The building also housed a makeshift school in the basement, which was being used because the regular neighborhood schools had been closed after earlier attacks, two residents said. The makeshift school was destroyed, but no students were harmed because school was out for the day. Hamuriyeh said several other residents also died in their homes from the strikes.

Residents who documented deaths from the December 3 strikes provided a list of 18 civilians killed, including six children.

Video footage from first responders arriving on the scene shows extensive damage to the neighborhood from the December 3 airstrikes.

**Irbin**

On November 23, at approximately 12:30 p.m., a Russian or Syrian aircraft carried out about eight strikes on the Eastern Ghouta town of Irbin, three residents said. Irbin is located near the edge of the enclave, less than a kilometer from the Vehicles Administration Center that anti-government armed groups attacked on November 14. The town is controlled by Faylaq Al-Rahman.

Four of the strikes hit a neighborhood in Irbin with a public market and residential buildings, approximately 100 meters apart, two residents said.

Ammar al-Bouchiri, a local resident who was at home when the first strike hit, said:

We heard a warplane… The munition hit the house that is immediately next door, that of our neighbors. The explosion was massive. I was at home and the sound was very loud. And I was thrown to the side.

He said he couldn’t feel anything for several seconds:

There was yelling, there was so much noise, and dust was all over the place. I couldn’t see anymore because of that. I couldn’t find my way out. The ceiling was down, doors were broken, and I couldn’t get out. I couldn’t see; the situation was horrifying.

The strikes killed three civilians: a shop-owner, and two children, and injured at least 20, according to media reports and witnesses.

“When I first got out, there was a dead man on the road facing our house, he was hit with a shrapnel piece,” al-Bouchiri said. “There were also two kids, one of them was still alive, we could still hear her voice.”

**Restrictions on Essential Goods and Humanitarian Access**

Syrian government forces and associated militias have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2013. In April 2017, government forces retook the Barzeh and Qaboun neighborhoods of eastern Damascus, closing off smuggling tunnels between the neighborhoods and further restricting the movement of aid into and evacuation of people with urgent medical needs out of the enclave.

The government further tightened the siege on October 3 by severely restricting the use of al-Wafideen, the only commercial trade-crossing with the enclave. The closure of the tunnels and the crossing made prices of goods in Eastern Ghouta skyrocket.

An aid worker said that in November the one-month cost in Eastern Ghouta of a “survival minimum expenditure basket” (SMEB) – a unit used by humanitarian organizations to measure basic survival needs per household – was approximately US$700. A UN inter-agency [assessment](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-duma-inter-agency-assessment-food-security-update-november-21-2017) found that by mid-November, the price of a bundle of bread in Eastern Ghouta was 85 times the price in nearby Damascus; in August it was 24 times the Damascus price. Residents estimated that the average worker made only between US$50 and a US$100 a month and said that the majority were unemployed.

Firas Abdullah, a media activist in the Eastern Ghouta city of Douma, described impact of the siege:

The siege is killing us. A man must work two jobs to scrape together enough money to put one meal for his children a day, if that. It’s almost as bad as it was in 2013-14. Then, we got to a point where we used to take the feed that we saved for the chicken – very harsh, inedible stuff – and eat it.

The government allows only one well-known merchant to use the al-Wafideen crossing to bring merchandise in, residents and aid workers said. They said that in November the merchant was required to pay a tax of approximately 2000 Syrian pounds (US$4) for each kilogram of material brought in, making goods even more expensive.

“Imagine the path to let aid in is clear, they [the Syrian government] can do it,” the doctor from Irbin said. “They just don’t want to. Instead, we must pay exorbitant prices, that go to the regime to fund the very militias that are besieging us.”

Another doctor said: “A lot of children are dying from malnutrition. And this is a shame to the entire international community, to all those who are watching.”

The Syrian government has restricted the number of UN aid convoys to the area and the amount and types of goods that can be delivered. Humanitarian workers said that the convoys that entered since September did not contain aid that was sufficient for the population they were intended for and often did not meet their needs. Even when permission is granted, administrative and security issues often result in excessive delays, a UN official based in Damascus said.

Since the tightening of the siege, there have been many reports of harm to civilians from a lack of adequate food or medicine. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said that at least five civilians died as a direct result of lack of food or medicine between November 14 and 28. On November 2, local media [reported](http://video.qasioun-news.com/en/video/show/14459) that a one year-old girl named Maram, who had been born with one kidney, needed medicine that was unavailable and surgery that could not be performed within the enclave.

Siege Watch [reported](https://siegewatch.org/#13/33.5460/36.3866) that on November 13, a child named Walid with a heart condition had died after Syrian authorities had refused requests for a medical evacuation. A hospital director said on November 30 that medications were running low, and that patients needed procedures and treatments that were unavailable: “a little girl died from a cardiac issue, to diagnose her we needed an echocardiogram, which we didn’t have for children.”

The doctors said that the lack of medicine and adequate medical care has made people desperate.

The doctor from Irbin described trying to evacuate a girl, Sara, who had a malignant tumor in her eye, a genetic condition that had killed two of her siblings:

We left no stone unturned trying to get her out, to treat her but to no avail. No one would let her out, or help us. She died. Her parents gave birth to another girl, around a month or two ago, initial tests indicate that she has the same sickness. Her father, this time, when I wanted to discuss treatment with him refused outright. He said he doesn't want to discuss treatment anymore, he doesn't want to treat her anymore – there is no point. We’ll wait to die together, he told me.

The doctor described the pressures on the medical system:

On the 18 or 19 [of November], there was an airstrike and a relative of mine was injured. A young guy, 33 years old with children, whose hands had to be amputated. I was the one to treat him, but I didn't realize it was my relative. I didn’t realize until I got home, and my wife told me a relative of mine had to have his hand amputated. I asked her, was it the one with the two hands amputated? She said yes. I treated him but I was so overwhelmed with the number of patients, I didn’t even recognize him. This is our lives now.

**International Humanitarian Law**

International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, which apply to the armed conflict in Syria, prohibit attacks that target civilians or civilian property, that do not or cannot discriminate between civilians and combatants, or that cause harm to civilians or civilian property that is disproportionate to any anticipated military gain. All parties to the conflict have an obligation to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians from harm, and not to deploy forces in densely populated areas.

The laws of war do not prohibit siege warfare so long as the purpose is to achieve a military objective and not to starve or cause disproportionate harm to the civilian population. Civilians may not be forcibly displaced unless their security depends on their evacuation.

A party that imposes a siege that has the effect of starving the civilian population has an obligation to provide access for humanitarian aid for civilians in need and not arbitrarily interfere with it. Parties must also ensure the [freedom of movement](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule56) of humanitarian workers, which can only be restricted temporarily for reasons of imperative military necessity.

Individuals who commit serious violations of the laws of war with criminal intent – that is, intentionally or recklessly – may be prosecuted for war crimes. Individuals may also be held criminally liable for assisting in, facilitating, aiding, or abetting a war crime.",267,"English"
2388674,"The Road Home: How the Burundi Hotline Helped a Victim of Kidnapping Find His Way Home **By Hannah Powell Losada**

Burundi - Egide* is a rice farmer from a rural village in western Burundi. Each evening he travels back to his home after many long hours of working in the fields. But there’s one night he’ll never forget.

It was late evening in April 2017 when a group of armed men gunned down the taxi that Egide was traveling in, shooting at the wheels and blowing out one of the tires. The men forcibly removed Egide from the car, blindfolded him and drove him for about an hour to what he believes was the DRC.  Still blindfolded, the gunmen then had Egide leave the car and walk the rest of the way.

“I remember crossing a river, it was deep and all of my clothes got wet. The only river I know like this is the one that divides Burundi from the DRC,” Egide recalled. At the end of his blindfolded journey, Egide and his kidnappers reached a building where he was kept in a small empty room.

Though Edige doesn’t know why he was targeted, kidnapping is a common occurrence in the region where Egide lives, because nearby armed rebel groups and bandits from the Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) use the ransom that families pay to retrieve their loved ones as a regular source of income.  

Back in Burundi, the taxi driver drove straight to Egide’s home after the attack and informed his wife, Diane*, of the kidnapping. Panicked, Diane called friends and family, asking what she could do to find her husband. One of her friends, a volunteer at a local NGO, had heard about a national hotline, which provides information and assistance to vulnerable communities since the beginning of Burundi’s political crisis, and advised Diane to dial the short code 109 to contact the hotline for assistance.

A hotline operator listened to what happened to Egide and used her experience with other kidnapping cases to guide Diane through the ransom process.  Hotline operators coached her on how to speak with the kidnappers to maximize Egide’s chances for survival and were in constant contact until Egide’s release had successfully been negotiated.  Once informed that Egide had been released, Diane and a local policeman searched for him until they found him dehydrated, weak and scared near the river he originally crossed with his captors. Egide had spent approximately ten anxious days in an empty room, surviving on only one sweet potato a day that his captors gave him and drinking dirty water from a puddle in the room.

Once Egide was safe, the hotline then referred him to a local organization to obtain treatment for dehydration and hunger. The information and assistance provided by the 109 hotline allowed Egide’s family to respond effectively to the kidnapping situation. Jacqueline, one of the hotline operators, feels that her work at the hotline is essential to helping Burundians in crises and is glad to be part of the dedicated team that works together to run the hotline and provide ongoing support to callers.

Launched in October 2015, the hotline is an interagency initiative of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Burundi Red Cross (CRB), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Vision International (WVI) and Caritas Burundi. Over the past two years, the hotline has responded to over 6300 callers from across the country, viewable online via Community Response Map Burundi.

Today, the hotline operators continue working to connect Egide and others like him to essential emergency services, ensuring that vulnerable communities in Burundi have a lifeline to call for urgent assistance and protection against violence.

2388619,"In war-torn South Sudan, one town nurtures a small-scale peace **_While the rest of the country is divided, Ganyiel, sheltered by marshes, has grown as an ethnically mixed town that could serve as a model for nurturing pockets of peace elsewhere_**

By Stefanie Glinski

GANYIEL, South Sudan, Dec 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Surrounded by swamps and accessible only by plane or boat, South Sudan's Ganyiel, a rebel-held town in a country torn apart by civil war, has been dubbed a ""haven of peace"" by its residents.

Impoverished and living with the constant threat of floods, Ganyiel's population of some 40,000 people nevertheless consider themselves lucky.

Several ethnic groups live together relatively peacefully - navigating the town's waterways in tree-carved boats.

The world's youngest nation, South Sudan gained independence in 2011, but descended into civil war four years ago when President Salva Kiir accused his deputy Riek Machar of trying to oust him.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people and created Africa's largest refugee crisis.

Fighting has raged along ethnic lines, between forces loyal to the mainly ethnic Dinka government and the opposition fighters, most of whom are ethnic Nuer.

But while the rest of the country is divided, Ganyiel, sheltered by marshes, which form natural defences in the centre of the country, has grown as an ethnically mixed town that could serve as a model for nurturing pockets of peace elsewhere.

""We're a peaceful island within South Sudan,"" said Ganyiel's town director, Michael Lot.

""Just two months ago, 2,700 Dinka arrived here, fleeing food insecurity and conflict. They are welcome. The war is political. It's not between us people.""

CHALLENGES

A third of South Sudan's 12 million population has fled their homes amid persistent reports of gang rape and ethnic violence.

Despite its well defended location, war remains a constant threat in Ganyiel and it is regularly hit by floods that destroy the harvest.

The town has depended on food distributions by the U.N.'s World Food Programme as long as residents can remember.

But in contrast to other areas, marriage and trade among different ethnic groups is common while five aid agencies have coordinated to provide basic education and healthcare.

Each evening, as the sun sets, the town's red dirt airstrip fills with people taking walks or playing football in the evening breeze.

The bucolic peace is sometimes frayed by disputes over cattle, land and water, which can escalate into feuds between clans.

And with a prevalence of guns even among civilians, killings and revenge killings are not uncommon, said a South Sudanese aid worker who asked not to be named.

FREE MOVEMENT

Mary Deng arrived in Ganyiel two months ago. She's a Dinka and her journey north took her several days.

""Our community was accused of intermarrying with Nuer people and we no longer felt safe,"" said the mother of three.

""We move freely in Ganyiel and interact with the community,"" she said, sitting on the ground outside her hut, holding her youngest son on her lap. ""Intermarriage has been common in this area for a long time.""

This is largely due to cattle trading, facilitated by the town's trade union that promotes livestock sales in the surrounding region and as far north as the Sudan border.

""Proximity to the River Nile has linked Ganyiel to Juba and the outer world, thus making it a hub for the entire region. Fish and livestock products are exported through the port to the capital and other markets,"" said Raphael Ndiku, a Ganyiel-based aid worker with German agency Welthungerhilfe.

Commodities and people have always moved in and out of the town, mixing its residents with outsiders.

""Trade was flourishing here before the war,"" said Kharbin Banybor, head of the Panyijiar County Trade Union.

""The trade and free movement led to a lot of intermarriages, even with Arabs from the north,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Adut Amal, a Dinka woman from the town of Yirol, about 60 km (40 miles) to the south, is the widow of a Nuer man. Sitting on a mattress in the shade, she is wrapped in a floral robe.

She has lost her eyesight and doesn't know her age, but still remembers the day she came to Ganyiel after her marriage.

""My husband was a trader who knew my family well. It was difficult to leave my home and move away, but the community welcomed me openly,"" she said, recalling her difficulties learning the Nuer language and the culture's songs and customs.

""I still sing Dinka songs, but I know that Ganyiel is my home,"" Amal said. ""The country is in crisis, but to me all people are the same.""

TRADE

Access to food has been a struggle in Ganyiel and the townspeople depend on food drops by plane.

The sparse selection of goods in the market are brought in from Juba by Nuer traders and are shipped up the Nile through government-held areas by their Dinka partners.

""It's increasingly difficult and the markets are almost empty now, but we try to keep our businesses going,"" said shopkeeper Kuany Thiong, standing by his stall selling flour, onions and yeast. There are few vegetables in the market – families live mainly on sorghum and beans.

Helicopters and small airplanes arrive on the dirt airstrip several times a week, bringing in aid workers and health personnel.

""They have figured out how to make it work, covering the town's basic needs,"" said Ian Ridley, head of South Sudan's United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

""The need is still great, even though Ganyiel enjoys relative peace and safety due to its geographic location.""

For Banybor, the trade union head, Ganyiel is a model town, even with widespread poverty and hunger. ""Both the humanitarian response and the interethnic relations work. A lot can be learned from it,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

So-called bottom-up grassroots peace initiatives need to be pursued as well as peace talks at the top level, said a Juba-based expert on conflict monitoring.

The December-to-May dry season usually intensifies clashes and there is little chance of peace talks to end the war, diplomats and analysts said last month.

""The war is all around us and it's dangerous,"" said Banybor. ""I'm happy that we get to feel safe in Ganyiel for now.""",267,"English"
2388604,"DSWD provides P39.9 M worth of aid to families affected by ‘Urduja’ The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has so far provided a total of P39,927,848.80 worth of assistance to families and individuals affected by Tropical Depression ‘Urduja’ through the local government units (LGUs) in Regions V, VI, VII, VIII, MIMAROPA and CARAGA.

Of this amount, P35,560,766.64 was allotted to Eastern Visayas for the relief operation in the affected provinces of Biliran; Leyte; and, Eastern, Northern, and Western Samar, which experienced the worst effects of the tropical depression. Residents in the affected cities and municipalities in the provinces experienced severe flooding, landslides, and power interruption. The weather disturbance has also damaged a bridge and several roads and houses in the region.

Meanwhile, LGUs in affected areas have provided a total of P1,253,575.00, bringing the total combined worth of assistance provided to the affected families to P41,181,423.80.

The DSWD and its Field Offices (FOs) have been working closely with the affected LGUs for the continuous provision of relief assistance to the affected families, especially those in hardest-hit areas.

DSWD Officer-in-Charge Emmanuel A. Leyco said that the Department is intensifying its relief operations to respond to the needs of the affected individuals.

“The NROC will be on 24/7 shift to produce 479,000 food packs this December to respond to those affected by ‘Urduja’ and in preparation for the possible effects of yet another weather disturbance which may soon enter the country, as well as to satisfy the remaining requirements of Field Office XII as it continues to respond to Marawi crisis,” OIC Leyco said.

The Officer-in-Charge stated that the Department will prioritize the daily production of 200,000 family food packs (FFPs)  for Tacloban City until Dec 23. He said the World Food Programme has committed to transport the food packs to the city.

Meanwhile, the Department’s field office in Region VIII, which is responding to the needs of the affected residents in severely-hit Eastern Visayas, had asked the LGUs to immediately submit damage reports for the prompt provision of augmentation support as it moves to the second round of relief distribution.

DSWD-FO VIII has released more than 17,000 food packs, while 37,736 FFPs were allocated to affected areas that submitted their reports. The field office has a stockpile of 98,000 FFPs.

Yesterday, DSWD-FO VI released 227 family food packs to affected residents in the region. Of which, 40 FFPs were used to feed stranded passengers bound for Cebu, Manila, and Cagayan; while 187 were dispatched to evacuees in Concepcion, Iloilo.

As of 2 PM today, ‘Urduja’ has affected a total of 244,301  families or 1,016,560  individuals in 1,679  barangays in the Bicol Region; Eastern, Western, and Central Visayas; MIMAROPA; and, CARAGA.

Some 11,670  families or 53,448  individuals are still staying in 365 open evacuation centers in Regions V, VIII, and MIMAROPA, the bulk of which is located in Region VIII, while 17,557 families or 47,791 persons evacuated to their families’ and friends’ houses.

To date, evacuation centers in Western Visayas and in the CARAGA Region have been closed.

“We see that Urduja has caused significant damage to life and property. The DSWD will continue to work closely with local government units and other national government agencies to determine the fastest and surest way to assist the affected families,” OIC Leyco said.

“We also appeal to the public to support all efforts to help the families so they can recover as soon as possible. We must all work collectively to ensure that aid reaches those who need it,” he added. ###",267,"English"

Caritas India had constructed 18 elevated hand pumps and 2 ring wells for 20 villages of Hailakandi, Dhemaji and Lakhimpur districts of Assam which were devastated during 2017 floods. These hand pumps were installed based on the geographical locations, like the low land areas hand pumps were elevated to five feets whereas in high land it was raised till three feets.

These hand pumps are not only special in technological aspect but has a social impact. Installed with Direct Action Pump for Low Lift Wells, ‘Tara pump’ is recommended by the Word Bank. It is not only low cost but also provide high discharge rate with safe from bacteriological contamination with minimal maintenance. These hand pump platforms were supported with ramps so that specially abled, old aged and children find it easier to reach to the source of water.

3829 families are getting benefits from these newly constructed water points. Caritas India has implemented the project through Seva Kendra Silchar and Women Development Centre, Guwahati, by keeping people’s choice as the highest priority and ensuring Sphere standards.

During the community meetings, women from the flood affected areas placed their challenge of drinking water. Caritas India team took the issue seriously and installed handpumps and ring wells with the decisions and consent of the people.

Community exhibited greater ownership by contributing in the construction including sand for the hand pumps and ring wells. Inhabitants from Hindus, Christians and Muslims denominations observed combined faith prayer during the inauguration and assured complete ownership and maintenance of the newly constructed water points.

2388559,"Coping with trans-generational trauma: a key feature of peacebuilding work in Rwanda Within a 100-day span in the spring and summer of 1994 the Rwandan genocide claimed the lives of an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Tutsis and their sympathisers. A generation has since past yet Rwandans, old and young alike, are continuing to experience post-genocide trauma. Why is this the case and what can be done to counter this enduring trauma?

As with any society that has suffered horrible atrocities, post-genocide Rwanda has had to cope with an enduring trauma. This phenomenon has been observed not only among those that lived through the 1994 Rwandan genocide, but also among a second generation of Rwandans who continue to suffer from the societal trauma caused by this tragedy. This observation brings us to undoubtedly confirm that trauma, if not healed, can become a _transgenerational phenomenon_.

**Trans-generational trauma: an existing reality in Rwanda**

The transmission of trauma from one generation to another and its related consequences are gradually gauging the interest of peacebuilding organizations in Rwanda, key among them Community-Based Sociotherapy (CBS) which is currently working on this particular issue. CBS has explored the intergenerational legacies of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, investigating specifically how the genocide, its aftermath and related events are transmitted within families to future generations.

In its recent research project, entitled “Intergenerational Legacies of the Genocide in Rwanda and Community Based Sociotherapy: Identifying and Addressing Pathways of Transmission,” it was revealed that the legacies of the 1994 genocide and its aftermath have been transmitted to the second generation within families through direct and indirect pathways, which are interrelated and interact in multiple ways.

The direct pathways of inter-generational transmission concern the ways in which the genocide and related events are reflected upon, reconstructed and explicitly communicated - or not - to the second generation.

The indirect pathways of inter-generational transmission are the ways in which the genocide affects the second generation’s socio-cultural environment and, in turn, the child. One of the research project's key findings, as pointed out by CBS, is that the legacy of the genocide, including its transmission of trauma and violence across generations, is a risk factor for sustainable peace and development.

It is understandably true that those who were alive when the genocide happened have been suffering from traumatic experiences and troubling memories. For members of the second generation, i.e. those who were not yet born when the genocide happened and are direct descendants of those who witnessed the genocide, though they did not directly experience the physical and psychological pain of the genocide, they have been raised in a traumatised society and, in one way or another, have been affected by the multiple consequences of the tragedy.

Living in a post-genocide context, all Rwandans have suffered from leftover trauma: no one can claim to be immune from the society’s _‘generalised’_ suffering. The fact that even those who were born after the genocide can acquire the trauma from parents, relatives and neighbours, has put trauma-healing efforts on the list of priorities for ensuring sustainable peace and development in Rwanda. 

In order to respond to this issue and break the cycle of trauma and violence, a consortium on the issue was recently formed, which is composed of the following organizations: Community Based Sociotherapy Rwanda (CBS), Prison Fellowship Rwanda (PFR), Anglican Church in Rwanda/Byumba Diocese (EAR-D/B) and Duhumurizanye Iwacu Rwanda (DIR). Supported by Palladium Rwanda, the consortium is undertaking a pilot project called _Umusingi w’Amahoro Arambye_ (‘The Foundation for Sustainable Peace’ in the Kinyarwanda language).

The project aims at facilitating evidence-based grassroots advocacy and strengthening citizen’s participation in order to contribute to the recognition and prevention of inter-generational transmission of trauma and violence at the family and community levels. The project is being coordinated by Community Based Sociotherapy Rwanda and implemented by Prison Fellowship Rwanda and the Anglican Church, Byumba Diocese, in close cooperation with the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (NURC).

**Towards creating a conducive environment for effectively coping with trans-generational trauma in Rwanda**

To effectively address this inter-generational trauma and contribute to ensuring sustainable peace and reconciliation, it is of utmost importance that the issues that mark the lives of Rwandans at a grassroots level are known to policymakers and the voices of the community members are heard. In addition, practices at the community level that aim at reconciliation and development could be even more effective when they are informed about trauma.

CBS explains that a trauma-informed approach: (1) is aware of the impact of trauma on individuals and communities and understands potential pathways to recovery; (2) recognises the signs and symptoms of trauma; (3) responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies and practices; and (4) seeks to actively resist the re-traumatisation and transmission of trauma. A trauma-informed approach complies with some key principles, such as creating safety, trust and mutual support, rather than a prescribed set of practices or procedures.

To be able to contribute to this, the Umusingi w’Amahoro arambye project has proposed a ‘4A’s strategy’: awareness, advocacy, acknowledgement and action. Through the project, the consortium intends to: increase awareness on the necessity of investing in responding to the problem of inter-generational transmission of trauma; develop and implement appropriate mechanisms for grassroots advocacy; identify and acknowledge issues related to trans-generational trauma; and, take actions to inspire policy and practices with the aim of ensuring that the healing and reconciliation processes in Rwanda are sustainable.

Launched on Thursday 28 September 2017, at Marasa Umubano Hotel, the project is expected to start a policy dialogue between national and local government representatives and local civil society, leading to the integration of efforts to counter inter-generational trauma in national policies and practices on national unity and reconciliation, mental health, youth and socio-economic issues.

To effectively break through the cycle of intergenerational transmission of trauma and violence, there is a pressing need to promote initiatives like the Umusingi w’Amahoro Arambye project and expand them throughout the country.

Such initiatives should create a conducive environment and provide opportunities for generations to freely talk with one another, for elders and adults to frankly share the truth about the past, and for young people to openly ask questions about the history of their country and guarantee the rights of imagining and creating the future they want.",267,"English"

**_A water supply scheme based on solar power solves the lack of availability of water in a village._**

The Makhala village is located in the Amravati district in the southwestern Satpura mountain ranges. Situated at 959 m above mean sea level, this Maharashtra village has 352 households with a population of 1045. Although accessible by road in all seasons, the village is isolated and surrounded by forests. The nearest village is Semadoh at a distance of 12 km. Needless to say, the power supply is still miles away in this village.

“There are only two dug wells in the village and most of the time, only one well is functional in all seasons. The last two decades had seen the villagers' dependency on water tankers increasing. The women of the village had to walk at least 1.5 km on the steep hills to bring water for domestic use. The deployment of tanker for the village during summer was a routine, and the access to water was a challenge for the villagers, especially women,” says the sarpanch of the village, Mangarai Motilal Kazdekar.

In 2000, the Rural Water Supply Division (RWSD), zila parishad (district council), a government agency executed a solar-power-based mini water supply scheme to improve the access of the villagers to drinking water. But, within one year of its implementation, the solar panels were stolen. Due to power failure, the villager’s water situation worsened. There was no other alternative for power supply. In 2011, RWSD took the initiative to implement it again.

“On February 4, 2011, the scheme was technically sanctioned by the executive engineer, rural water supply division, Shweta Banerjee for Rs 49.33 lakh. On March 15, 2011, the RWSD commenced the work in the village. After overcoming the challenges in the implementation like procurement of solar pumps of 2.4KW (Kilowatt) and 80m head, fixation of power supply cable, etc. the scheme finally got commissioned on January 1, 2012,” says Kishor Raghuwanshi, subdivisional engineer, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP), a government agency.

After the implementation of the solar scheme, the struggle for drinking water for the women of the village has almost come to an end. The gram panchayat has provided water connections to more than 90 percent of the households. The villagers now receive piped water supply for half-an-hour every day, improving their access to water for drinking and other domestic use. 

“It is only due to the sincere efforts of the RWSD team that our access to drinking water has been ensured. The village women are now very happy because one of their major problems is solved,” says a villager Vijay Bhusari.

As per the villagers, following are the benefits of the implementation of the solar scheme:

- No tankers were required to be deployed in the village since the summer of 2011. 
- The number of malnourished children has reduced due to access to clean drinking water. The women of the village get to spend more time with their children because the time spent for procuring water from distant places has been saved.
- Construction work in the village has accelerated due to improved availability of water.

“After closely observing the benefits of the scheme, solar-based water supply schemes have been replicated in other hilly, inaccessible and tribal villages in Chikaldara block of Amravati district which do not have the power supply,” says Shweta Banerjee, executive engineer.",267,"English"
2388544,"NDMA conducts mock exercise on earthquake in Haryana **_Simulates disaster scenarios to assess preparedness and response_**

**NEW DELHI, THURSDAY:** A State-level mock exercise on earthquake was conducted by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in Haryana on Thursday for assessing the preparedness and response mechanism of the State Government in a disaster situation. The exercise was conducted in collaboration with the Haryana State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA).

The exercise simulated an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter Scale with its epicentre at West of Gurugram along the Jaipur Ridge and the Sohna Fault line. 

The simulation exercise was conducted simultaneously at 122 select locations, including hospitals, shopping malls, schools, high-rise residential buildings and major hazardous units, spread across all 22 districts to assess and improve the administration’s capacity in mobilising resources and reaching out to the affected communities swiftly.

**The day in action**

NDMA expert, who led the exercise, briefed about the proceedings of the day. The exercise started with a siren indicating the occurrence of tremors. Everybody ducked under the tables while covering their heads. Once the tremors stopped, evacuation drills were conducted. Soon afterwards, the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) was activated. 

Simultaneously, EOCs at the districts also got activated, assessed the damage, formed rescue teams under Incident Commanders and dispatched them to the respective locations. Rescue drills were conducted in coordination with various agencies, such as Traffic control, Fire Fighting department, Ambulances, Police and Civil Defense. 

People buried under the rubble were rescued and sent to hospitals after administrating preliminary first aid.

After the drill a post-exercise analysis was carried out by NDMA, in which all concerned officials took part. Independent observers from Army shared their feedback and suggested ways to further streamline response mechanisms.

**Preparatory meetings**

This exercise began with a orientation conference on December 6 and was followed by  a coordination Conference on December 19 and a tabletop exercise on December 20 done through videoconferencing with all districts from the State Capital. These preparatory meetings were conducted to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise.

Haryana falls in the seismic zone IV, III, & II. Moreover, tremors have been felt in the State whenever there is an earthquake in the Himalayan foothills due to its proximity to the hill States. Moreover, the State has witnessed rapid industrial-residential urbanisation in the recent past. An earthquake can cause major damage in terms of lives and infrastructure. This mock drill will ensure better response in the event of a disaster to reduce loss of lives. ",267,"English"
2388534,"Statement by the Spokesperson on the deterioration of the humanitarian and security situations in eastern Ukraine The humanitarian and security situations have deteriorated abruptly in eastern Ukraine, where we have seen the highest number of ceasefire violations since February 2017, the ensuing loss of life and the destruction of property. The positioning of armed forces in close proximity to residential areas and firing from or towards critical infrastructure shows complete disrespect for peoples' lives. Greater restraint and further efforts to protect water supplies and energy infrastructure is vital.

The ceasefire needs to be respected, military forces must disengage and withdraw heavy weapons to verifiable storage areas. We also reiterate that full, safe and unhindered access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and its technical equipment throughout the entire area foreseen by its mandate is essential.

It is crucial that the Minsk agreements are implemented by all sides. We expect Russia in particular to make full and immediate use of its influence on the separatists in this regard. The agreement reached in today's Trilateral Contact Group on a renewed ceasefire commitment for the holiday period is a necessary step, though immediate restraint in the meantime remains imperative.

Russia's withdrawal of its contingent from the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) also has serious negative implications for the maintenance of a ceasefire and on the stabilisation of the line of contact. We expect both sides to take all necessary measures so that the JCCC can resume its critical role in resolving serious security issues on the ground.

The European Union continues to support the ongoing diplomatic efforts towards full implementation of the Minsk agreements as the basis for a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine that respects Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.

L'information a été donnée officiellement par le secrétaire général du Conseil national des Républicains (CNR), Jean Gustave Tongo, représentant Ntumi. C'était lors d’une conférence de presse qu’il a donnée dans la salle de réunions du ministère de l’Intérieur et de la décentralisation. 

Il a affirmé que la sortie des ex-combattants et leur réinsertion, le ramassage des armes, la mise en place d’un comité ad hoc pour le suivi des engagements pris dans cet accord, sont, entre autres, les points contenus dans ce texte. 

«Aujourd’hui c’est un grand jour pour le peuple congolais. Car, nous venons de signer un accord qui va mettre un terme aux troubles dans notre pays. Nous sommes des grandes personnes et nous avons l’obligation de vivre ensemble», a déclaré M. Tondo, en présence du ministre de l’Intérieur et de la décentralisation, Raymond Zéphirin Mboulou, quelques sages du Pool et quelques hauts officiers de la force publique.

L’objectif visé est de contribuer à la réduction de la mortalité maternelle, néonatale et infanto-juvénile dans le district sanitaire de Mangodara d’ici à 2021 à travers une approche communautaire participative.

C’est dans la joie et la ferveur que les différents actes symbolisant le démarrage du deuxième round de ce projet ont posés. En effet, la population sortie massivement, a salué la relance de cette initiative qui avait contribué entre 2014 et 2016 à réduire la mortalité maternelle et infanto-juvénile dans 50 villages du district sanitaire de Mangodara. La seconde phase du Projet Intégré de Santé Communautaire dans le district sanitaire de Mangodara » qui va durer cinq ans (2017 à 2021), va consolider les acquis de la phase pilote.

Pour cette étape, la Croix-Rouge burkinabè nourrit de grandes ambitions. Elle escompte couvrir désormais 100 villages du département et concernera les 3 communes du district sanitaire (Mangodara, Ouo et Sidéradougou) avec 20 CSPS et 100 villages et Hameaux de culture. Le nombre de volontaires communautaires impliqués dans la mise en œuvre passe aussi de 156 à 400. « La population totale bénéficiaire directe de la zone d’intervention sélectionnée est estimée à 84 000 personnes dont 19 000 Femmes en âge de reproduction 15 000 enfants de moins de 5 ans » a indiqué Mme Aminata SORGHO/GOUBA, haut-commissaire de la Comoé qui a présidé la cérémonie. Le projet cible surtout les femmes en âge de procréer, les femmes enceintes, les femmes allaitantes et les enfants de moins de 5 ans. 

Pour y parvenir, l’équipe projet va travailler selon l’approche PSSBC (Premiers secours et santé à base communautaire). Il s’agit d’une approche participative qui intègre plusieurs bras d’interventions comme la promotion de la santé maternelle et infantile, la lutte contre le paludisme et la promotion de l’hygiène et des bonnes pratiques nutritionnelles et le renforcement des capacités des acteurs. Il est prévu des activités de promotion de santé maternelle et infantile, la prise en charge intégrée des maladies de l’enfant au niveau communautaire, la réalisation de forages, la construction de latrines, le renforcement du plateau technique des CSPS avec du matériel médicotechnique et l’électrification solaire de certains CSPS, la construction de 2 sièges pour les comités départementaux de la Croix-Rouge à Ouo et à Mangodara. 

S’adressant aux autorités locales, le président national de la Croix-Rouge burkinabè, Dénis BAKYONO a déclaré que « Pour réussir la mise en œuvre de ce projet, la Croix-Rouge Burkinabè a besoin de votre appui et de la participation active des populations qui en sont les principaux bénéficiaires. » Les activités prévues pour les 5 prochaines années (2017-2021), vont coûter environ 600 millions.

A la faveur d’une visite terrain du 15 au 17 décembre 2017 une mission de la Croix-Rouge burkinabè est allée constater de visu la construction de ces différentes infrastructures réalisées dans le cadre du renforcement de la résilience des communautés vulnérables dans la province du Namentenga face aux effets des changements climatiques.

Le Burkina Faso est un pays vulnérable du fait de sa position géographique et de sa démographie galopante, d’où de multiples risques de catastrophes. En effet, situé dans la bande sahélienne, il est l’un des pays qui subit de plein de fouet les aléas du changement climatique.

Malgré la volonté manifeste du gouvernement de prévenir et de gérer les catastrophes, celles-ci font toujours de nombreuses victimes mettant ainsi des familles dans une extrême vulnérabilité. Cette réalité a imposé à la Croix-Rouge Burkinabé (CRBF) d’inscrire dans son plan stratégique 2016-2020, de renforcer davantage son mécanisme de préparation et de réponse à ces situations pour les cinq prochaines années. 

**La province du Namentenga est l’une des localités les plus touchées.**

Dans cette dynamique de prévention des conséquences des catastrophes sur les populations, la CRBF s’est engagée, avec l’appui de la Croix-Rouge Luxembourgeoise, à construire au profit des populations des infrastructures durables. Un accent particulier a été mis sur la province du Namentenga qui est l’objet d’inondations récurrentes. L’objectif visé étant non seulement de réduire les effets du changement climatique, mais aussi d’améliorer les conditions de vie des communautés les plus vulnérables. Pour ce faire, le projet « résilience des populations en matière d’habitat dans la province du Namentenga » est à pied d’œuvre et déjà. Les résultats sont visibles et palpables sur le terrain.  

Avec l’implication des populations bénéficiaires, neuf diguettes d’une longueur d’au moins 200m chacune ont été construites dans les trois villages bénéficiaires à savoir Nièga, Yagb-tenga et Lilyala. Ces ouvrages devraient contribuer à réduire la vitesse de l’eau en cas de fortes pluies et ainsi réduire les cas d’inondation des concessions et places publiques tels que les marchés.

En outre, le projet travaille à la récupération des sols pour les cultures. A termes, au moins 25 hectares de terres cultivables seront récupérés pour des travaux champêtres. Pour ce faire, des cordons pierreux sont en cours de réalisation avec la participation effective des populations qui ont compris l’importance de tels ouvrages. 

Les trois villages bénéficiaires disposeront au finish chacun d’un boulie. D’ores et déjà, celui de Nièga est en cours de finalisation. Avec cette infrastructure, c’est l’élevage et la maraicher culture qui seront de plus en plus développés. En effet, au-delà de sa fonction de prévention des cas d’inondation par la collecte du trop-plein d’eau en cas de forte pluviométrie, cette infrastructure contribuera à l’abreuvage des troupeaux en saison sèche. Des espaces cultivables y seront aménagés pour réaliser des cultures de contre saison.

**Résilience renforcée en matière d’habitat**

Les inondations et les vents violents exposent de nombreuses personnes à une plus grande vulnérabilité par suite de la destruction des habitats et des greniers. Aussi, la Croix-Rouge Burkinabè travaille-t-elle à la promotion de techniques de construction d’habitats durables pour les communautés afin de contribuer à la réduction des risques de catastrophes et les rendre plus résilientes aux calamités. Avec l’appui de la Croix-Rouge luxembourgeoise, des modèles shelter durables ont été expérimentés. Pour 2017, 80 maisons et latrines de ce type d’habitats ont été construits pour certains et en cours de construction pour d’autres dans les 3 villages de la commune de Boulsa. A la fin du projet en 2018, ce sont 250 maisons et 250 latrines qui seront construites au profit des personnes les plus vulnérables.",268,"French"

**MESSAGES CLÉS**

• Favorisée par une pluviométrie normale, la campagne agricole saison A se déroule normalement sur l’ensemble des régions du Nord-Est et CentreEst, où l’on assiste déjà à la consommation de la récolte verte pour le maïs, l’arachide et le haricot à certains endroits de la région des Kasaï, les provinces du sud Kivu et dans l’Ituri. La consommation des ménages pauvres en cette période pourrait être améliorée et ces derniers dépendront plus de leur propre production.

• Dans le Tanganyika, les dernières pluies torrentielles survenues dans la première décade du mois de décembre dans la partie Nord-Est du littoral lacustre de Kalemie, localités de Kaengele et Massamba, ont causé des inondations et des dommages importants sur l’habitat et les cultures estimés à environ une centaine des cases écroulés, 300 hectares de cultures vivrières endommagés 500 000 mètres de boutures de manioc perdus. Avec cette situation, les paysans ont procédé à des récoltes précoces de manioc et on pourrait s’attendre à une faible disponibilité alimentaire en ce début de la période de récolte et craindre des dégâts plus importants en cette saison.

• Dans une ambiance de fragilité de la situation politico économique de la RDC, la non tenue des élections à la date initialement prévue pourrait occasionner des manifestations qui pourraient engendrer des nouveaux mouvements des populations qui vont s’ajouter aux 4,1 millions déjà existants sur le territoire national. Ces derniers, en cette période de récolte, pourrait avoir ainsi un accès limité voire perdre leur récolte à l’issue des déplacements éventuels et dépendre ainsi des marchés pour s’approvisionner en nourriture.

• La présence massive d’environ 87 000 réfugiés sud-soudanais signalée dans la province de l’Ituri, territoire de Aru augmenterait la demande des produits vivriers par rapport à l’offre habituelle. Cette situation occasionnerait une perturbation de la disponibilité et une distorsion des prix des denrées sur les marchés de cette région du pays.

**SITUATION ACTUELLE**

Situation agricole : La période actuelle correspond aux premières récoltes (récoltes vertes) dans les régions du Nord Est et celle du Centre Est. Par contre dans la région du Sud Est, certains agriculteurs sont en pleine période de semis des principaux vivriers notamment le maïs, tandis que d’autres qui ont semés assez précocement poursuivent les travaux d’entretien des champs. Dans cette partie Sud-Est, cette période correspond à la période de soudure durant laquelle les denrées alimentaires se font rare. Malgré les prévisions agroclimatoloqiques qui annoncent une pluviométrie normale et en dessous de la normale dans certains endroits du pays, les limitations d’accès des populations des certaines provinces à leurs moyens d’existence, affecte la reprise agricole et partant la production agricole de ces régions déjà fragilisés par une crise évolutive sans précédent. (Tanganyika, Sud Kivu et Région du Kasaï). 

Marchés et Prix: Les déplacements de population et les conflits en cours ont eu des impacts négatifs sur le comportement général des marchés dans certaines parties des régions du Nord Est et du Centre Est où les prix sont sensiblement plus élevés par rapport à la même période de l'année précédente. En octobre 2017, les prix de la farine de maïs et de la farine de manioc à Kalemie étaient respectivement 70 pourcent et 140 pourcent au-dessus de leurs niveaux en octobre 2016. Par contre, les prix de ces céréales étaient relativement stable ou légèrement à la baisse dans les grands marchés de la région Sud Est pendant le même période en raison de l'augmentation des importations de maïs en provenance de la Zambie.  

Mouvement des populations : Dans le Kasaï Central, la baisse du nombre de déplacés qui est passé de 1,4 millions à 762 IDPs dans les 3 derniers mois selon OCHA, soit environ 54 ,4 pour cent de baisse à laquelle s’ajoute la situation sécuritaire quasi stable favorisé par la présence renforcée des forces gouvernementales présagent d’un retour progressif à la normale pour les prochaines saisons agricoles. Ces retours, dans la plupart des cas, se sont produits en pleine saison culturale et n’ont pas permis aux retournés d’exploiter leurs terres à temps.  

A ce jour, la RDC compte en tout environ 4,1 millions de déplacés (Situation au 31 octobre 2017) dont un grand nombre se trouve au Nord Kivu (24 percent) suivi de la région des Kasaï (19 pourcent), le Tanganyika (16 pourcent), le sud Kivu (15 percent) et les autres repartis dans les autres provinces du Nord et de l’Ouest (26 percent).  

A ces chiffres s’ajoute la présence massive de près de 526,543 réfugiés en provenance des pays voisins dont principalement le Rwanda (43 pourcent), la République Centrafricaine (32 pourcent), le Sud Soudan (17 pourcent), le Burundi (8,8 pourcent) et les autres pays voisins (0,2 pourcent).  

Situation des catastrophes naturelles : Les dernières pluies survenues dans la première décade du mois de décembre dans la partie NordEst du littoral lacustre de Kalemie dans la province du Tanganyika ont causé d’énormes dégâts tant sur l’habitat que sur les cultures dans les localités de Kaengele et Massamba. Certaines récoltes ont été précipités notamment le manioc, le maïs et la patate douce et la zone devrait craindre des dégâts plus importants dans les jours à venir.  

Situation Nutritionnelle : Les résultats de l’enquête nutritionnelle effectuée dans les zones de santé affectées par la crise actuelle dans la province du Kasaï en mars 2017, montrent des taux de MAG et de MAS respectivement de 11 pourcent et 3,1 pourcent. Ces taux audessus de seuil d’urgence nécessite des interventions d’urgence pour sauver des vies et préserver les moyens d’existence des populations en crise.

Major Sidiki Samaké, Gouverneur de la région de Gao, portant règlementation de la circulation des véhicules et des engins motorisés entre les agglomérations dans la région de Gao.

La MINUSMA observe que cette décision s’inscrit dans le cadre des mesures visant à renforcer les efforts de sécurisation de la région et de protection des civils. La MINUSMA saisit donc cette occasion pour réaffirmer son soutien aux mesures des autorités maliennes visant à contribuer à la consolidation d’un environnement sécurisé pour les populations, dans le respect de leur droits fondamentaux, y compris la non entrave de la bonne marche du processus de paix.

Dans ce contexte, la MINUSMA reconnait le rôle et la responsabilité qui incombent au Gouverneur de Gao lui permettant de prendre les décisions pertinentes et utiles à la protection des civils et à la stabilisation de la région.

2390989,"Au Pays-Bas, l'ONU inaugure un nouveau centre pour mieux répondre aux crises humanitaires 22 décembre 2017 – Le Secrétaire général des Nations Unies, António Guterres, a inauguré le Centre de données humanitaires, ce vendredi, à la Haye, aux Pays Bas. Ce centre, qui vise à faciliter l'échange et l'utilisation des données en temps réel, permettra de mieux répondre aux crises humanitaires dans le monde.

Le Secrétaire général a rappelé que 136 millions de personnes étaient aujourd'hui victimes de crises. Connaître exactement leur situation, avoir des données chiffrées sur leur environnement et échanger rapidement ces informations sont essentiels pour les organisations humanitaires.

« Des données précises constituent la pierre angulaire d'une bonne politique et d'une bonne prise de décision. Les obtenir et les partager entre des centaines d'organisations, en pleine urgence humanitaire, s'avère compliqué et prend beaucoup de temps, mais c'est absolument crucial », a déclaré M. Guterres lors de l'inauguration du centre à La Haye.

Les exemples sur le terrain ne manquent pas, a rappelé le chef de l'ONU : lors du passage dévastateur des ouragans dans les Caraïbes, l'échange des données sur les alertes préventives a permis aux gouvernements des pays touchés et aux organisations internationales de se préparer et d'évacuer, à temps, les populations.

Ce nouveau centre devrait donc faciliter le travail des organisations et travailleurs humanitaires, en se concentrant sur trois domaines : la construction de réseaux – mise en contact avec des universitaires et experts en technologie –, l'accès et la protection des données.

Géré par le Bureau des Nations Unies pour la coordination des affaires humanitaires (OCHA) et soutenu par le gouvernement néerlandais, ce centre est un « indicateur pour l'avenir », a déclaré le Secrétaire général. « Il aidera les humanitaires à prendre des décisions éclairées et responsables pour répondre aux besoins les plus urgents des populations ».",268,"French"

Elle renforce leurs capacités et ce, sur l’ensemble du territoire. Ainsi, au cours de ce mois de décembre, à Mopti, Tombouctou et Gao, elle a tenu une série d’atelier avec les acteurs locaux du domaine sur le thème : "" la prévention et la mitigation des conflits et violences liés aux élections"".

Dans un contexte post crise, marqué par une situation politique complexe, la prévention des conflits et autres violences à l’issue des élections est d’une importance capitale. Dans le cadre du mandat qui lui a été attribué par le Conseil de Sécurité des Nations Unies, la MINUSMA, par le biais de sa Division des Affaires Electorales, veille à accompagner les acteurs dans ce travail en organisant des rencontres d’information, d’échange et de réflexion sur ce thème. 

Après Bamako, en novembre, Mopti et Tombouctou ont chacune accueilli, au cours du mois de décembre, un de ces ateliers de deux jours sur "" la prévention et la mitigation des conflits et violences liés aux élections "". Ces rencontres ont été mises en œuvre par le réseau d’organisations de la société civile regroupées au sein de l’Association Malienne pour le Relèvement du Taux de Participation aux Elections (AMRTPE), une ONG nationale. Initiées par les Divisions des Affaires Electorales de la MINUSMA, elles bénéficient de l’accompagnement technique et financier de la Mission onusienne mais aussi du Canada.

A Mopti, du 11 au 13 décembre, plus de 100 acteurs nationaux, dont plus de 40% de femmes ont pu bénéficier d’une formation et d’une expertise sur la prévention des conflits et violences liés aux élections. A Tombouctou également, ce ne sont pas moins de 100 personnes qui ont pu y être initiées et/ou renforcer leurs connaissances et leurs savoir-faire dans le domaine. Partout où s’est tenu cet atelier, parmi les participants on comptait des représentants des autorités, des partis politiques, des parties signataires de l’Accord pour la Paix et la Réconciliation, des associations de jeunes, de femmes de la société civiles, des notabilités religieuses et traditionnelles ou encore des professionnels des médias. Dans quelques semaines, ces mêmes ateliers se tiendront à Gao et Kidal. 

**Un objectif ambitieux mais atteignable**

Ledit projet prévoit le renforcement des capacités de 540 acteurs nationaux sur l’ensemble du territoire national sur la prévention des conflits et violences liés aux élections ainsi que la mise en place d’un mécanisme de veille et de prévention des conflits. Ce mécanisme sera rendu possible grâce à 1424 médiateurs communautaires, formés et outillés pour prévenir et résoudre d’éventuelles tensions pouvant survenir en période électorale. A terme, près de 2000 acteurs électoraux seront en mesure de prévenir les conflits qui pourraient survenir après la tenue d’élections. Le projet qui entend apporter un appui à la finalisation de la prévention des conflits et violences liés aux élections, contribuera à la consolidation de la démocratie et de la gouvernance participative, à travers le renforcement à long et moyen termes, des capacités des acteurs nationaux.",268,"French"
2390979,"Mauritanie : Mise à jour sur la sécurité alimentaire - décembre 2017 **Apres l’ouest de la zone agropastorale, la situation de Stress (Phase 2 de l’IPC) menace le centre et le sud du pays**

**MESSAGES CLÉS** 

• Les effets cumulés de l’échec des cultures de décrue, de la médiocrité des pâturages, du faible niveau des revenus tirés de la cueillette et de l’exode prolongent la pression sur le cheptel et accentuent la dégradation des conditions d’accès alimentaire dans l’ouest de la zone agropastorale. De nombreux ménages pauvres y sont déjà en situation de Crise (Phase 3 de l’IPC).

• L’arrivée massive et précoce des transhumants dans le centre de la zone agropastorale et de la zone de cultures pluviales y a accéléré la dégradation des conditions pastorales et contraint les pauvres et moyens éleveurs et agropasteurs à dominante pastorale à recourir à des stratégies adaptatives saisonnières atypiques qui sont déjà sources de déficit de protection des moyens d’existence. Ils sont en train d’évoluer vers une situation de Stress (Phase 2 de l’IPC).

• Dans la vallée du fleuve Sénégal à cause de l’absence de la crue fluviale, le walo qui est la principale source de production agricole et de revenus des ménages pauvres n’a pas été exploité. Par ailleurs le faible niveau saisonnier du fleuve (à peine 2m50 contre 4 à 4,5 en année moyenne) rend aléatoire la réalisation des cultures irriguées de contre saison. Les ménages pauvres y sont déjà confrontés à des déficits de consommation qui les placent en situation de Stress (Phase 2 de l’IPC). 

**SITUATION ACTUELLE**

La progression de la saison : La saison froide s’est installée sur l’ensemble du pays mais on n’a pas encore enregistré des pluies qui favorisaient la levée de pâturages dans le nord et parfois jusqu’au sud du pays. Les vents du nord ont commencé à souffler entrainant le déracinement des herbes mal enracinées à cause de l’insuffisance et de l’irrégularité des pluies. 

Les cultures : La récolte des cultures irriguées d’hivernage est finie et si les rendements sont relativement proches de ceux de 2016, la production obtenue est nettement inférieure du fait de la baisse des superficies exploitées. De nombreux exploitants n’ont pas eu accès au crédit agricole. Dans toutes les zones de décrue, le développement des cultures est affecté par la médiocrité du bilan hydrique. 

Les conditions pastorales : La situation pastorale reste toujours préoccupante dans l’ouest du pays (centre, est et nord de la zone de transhumance pastorale, ouest de la zone agropastorale, centre de la zone de la Vallée du fleuve Sénégal). Dans le centre de la zone agropastorale et dans la zone de cultures pluviales, les poches de pâturages qui existaient, envahies par une transhumance précoce (depuis octobre au lieu de mars en année moyenne) et massive sont en passe de disparaitre. De nombreux éleveurs sont déjà au Mali et au Sénégal. Ceux qui sont encore en place recourent à des achats d’aliments bétail et du blé pour nourrir les animaux. 

Les revenus : Dans toutes les zones de cultures les revenus que les ménages pauvres tiraient des activités agricoles (préparation des sols, labour, récoltes, transport et transformations des récoltes etc.) sont en forte baisse tant par rapport à 2016 que par rapport à une année moyenne. Ceci s’explique autant par la forte baisse des superficies exploitées que par la médiocrité des récoltes. La cueillette des fruits sauvages dont les revenus arrivaient, les deux années précédentes, à couvrir jusqu’à trois mois de consommation d’un ménage pauvre, restent globalement très faibles (moins d’un mois de consommation alimentaire) car l’irrégularité et l’insuffisance des pluies ont affecté la productivité des arbres. Les revenus de l’exode restent encore maigres malgré des départs multiples et précoces (septembre /octobre au lieu de février/mars) car l’insertion des migrants dans les systèmes économiques urbains est de plus en plus difficile vu la forte croissance du nombre de demandeurs d’emploi. Les revenus provenant de la vente des animaux, bien qu’en hausse dans les marchés des centres urbains, sont, contrairement aux tendances saisonnières d’une année ne moyenne en nette baisse, dans les zones rurales par l’importante offre car, du fait de l’échec des cultures, les ménages pauvres sont obligés de procéder à des ventes saisonnières atypiques pour s’acheter de la nourriture et rembourser les dettes antérieures qui étaient sous hypothèque des récites. 

Les marchés: Tous les marchés de consommation sont bien approvisionnés en denrées alimentaires importées (riz, blé, sucre, huile) dont les prix relativement stables jusqu’en novembre accusent maintenant des hausses relativement importantes surtout dans les zones agropastorales et de la vallée du fleuve. Ce n’est que dans la zone de cultures pluviales qui capte l’essentiel des exportations maliennes de céréales que les prix du blé et du sorgho s’inscrivent dans une tendance baissière. La baisse du prix du riz local ne s’explique que par les récoltes de novembre et son indexation par rapport au prix du riz importé fait qu’il est peu probable qu’elle se prolonge d’autant que la production locale a connu, une importante baisse, comparativement aux deux précédentes années. 

A l’exception des marchés de bétail de la zone de cultures pluviales où est actuellement concentré la majeure partie du cheptel des transhumants qui n’ont pas encore franchi les frontières maliennes et sénégalaises, les marchés de bétail ruraux sont généralement mal approvisionnés et les prix des animaux y sont en forte baisse. Par contre les marchés de bétail urbain sont bien approvisionnés car ils constituent les terminaux des circuits développés par les courtiers. On notera que dans les marchés des zones de préoccupation les prix sont partout en baisse.",268,"French"

2390964,"En RDC, de nouvelles violences génèrent des déplacements vers l’Ouganda *Ceci est un résumé des déclarations du porte-parole du HCR Cécile Pouilly – à qui toute citation peut être attribuée – lors de la conférence de presse du 22 décembre 2017 au Palais des Nations à Genève.*

Le HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les Réfugiés, observe une forte augmentation du nombre de personnes originaires de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC) qui rejoignent l’Ouganda en quête de sécurité.

Plus de 2 650 réfugiés ont franchi la frontière cette semaine, après avoir fui de nouvelles violences dans la province de l’Ituri en RDC. C’est cinq fois le nombre habituel d’arrivants et la plupart sont des femmes et des enfants.

La majorité des réfugiés traversent le lac Albert à bord de bateaux de pêche et ils arrivent à Sebagoro, un village situé à 270 kilomètres au nord-ouest de Kampala, la capitale ougandaise. Environ 650 réfugiés sont arrivés à bord de deux bateaux ce matin. Ils transportaient avec eux des objets de valeur comme des motos et du bétail.

Cet itinéraire est emprunté par un grand nombre de réfugiés pour la première fois après un naufrage tragique en 2014 qui avait causé la mort de plus de 200 personnes.

Les nouveaux arrivants en Ouganda auraient fui la violence intercommunautaire sur le territoire de Djugu. Depuis lundi, selon certaines informations, des maisons ont été brûlées dans la région et des civils ont été attaqués à la machette et avec des armes à feu.

Plus de 20 villages ont été abandonnés par crainte de représailles. Les services ont cessé de fonctionner et la population est prise de panique.

Selon les réfugiés, encore davantage de civils sont rassemblés du côté congolais du lac Albert en attendant de pouvoir effectuer la traversée, malgré le coût élevé du voyage.

En Ouganda, le HCR renforce sa capacité pour répondre aux besoins des réfugiés. Nous apportons un appui aux autorités pour accueillir les nouveaux arrivants et les transférer dans l’installation de Kyangwali, à environ 50 kilomètres à l’est. Sur place, les réfugiés sont enregistrés, ils passent un examen médical et ils reçoivent des repas chauds et des articles de première nécessité.

Le HCR fait son possible dans l’installation de réfugiés pour identifier et aider les personnes ayant des besoins spécifiques, y compris les enfants non accompagnés et séparés, les survivants de la violence sexuelle et sexiste, les femmes enceintes et les personnes handicapées.

Toutefois, l’opération du HCR en Ouganda n’étant financée qu’à hauteur de 39 %, il est urgent d’augmenter les ressources afin de renforcer les capacités d’accueil et aider les nouveaux arrivants. C’est primordial, étant donné que l’Ouganda accueille déjà le plus grand nombre de réfugiés en Afrique - environ 1,4 million au total.

Parmi eux, on compte 231 500 Congolais. La plupart ont fui les violences dans le Nord-Kivu, une région en proie à une instabilité chronique dans l’est de la RDC.

Au total, le nombre de réfugiés congolais dans les pays voisins a augmenté de près de 100 000 personnes en un an, pour atteindre plus de 623 000 à la fin novembre.

Les réfugiés congolais sont accueillis en Ouganda, au Rwanda et en Tanzanie, avec des flux importants vers l’Angola et la Zambie en 2017. Les réfugiés s’ajoutent aux quelque 4,1 millions de Congolais déplacés internes, ce qui fait de la RDC le pays qui compte le plus grand nombre de personnes déracinées en Afrique.

La déclaration suivante a été communiquée aujourd’hui par le Porte-parole du Secrétaire général de l’ONU, M. António Guterres:

Le Secrétaire général, M. António Guterres, a prorogé le mandat du Tribunal spécial pour le Liban (TSL) pour une période de trois ans à compter du 1er mars 2018 ou jusqu’à l’achèvement des affaires dont il est saisi, si celui-ci intervient auparavant. La prolongation est conforme à la résolution 1797 (2005) du Conseil de sécurité.

Le Tribunal spécial, basé près de La Haye, aux Pays-Bas, a pour mandat de juger les personnes accusées d’avoir perpétré l’attentat du 15 février 2005 à Beyrouth, qui a tué 22 personnes, dont M. Rafiq Hariri, ancien Premier Ministre du Liban, et fait de nombreux blessés. Le procès par contumace de quatre personnes accusées de meurtre a débuté en janvier 2014 et est actuellement en cours.

Le TSL est également compétent pour juger les auteurs des attaques perpétrées au Liban entre le 1er octobre 2004 et le 12 décembre 2005, si elles sont liées à l’attentat du 14 février 2005 et sont de même nature et de même gravité.

Le Secrétaire général réaffirme l’engagement des Nations Unies à soutenir le travail du Tribunal spécial dans la lutte contre l’impunité pour ces crimes majeurs, afin de traduire les responsables en justice. L’ONU espère que le mandat du Tribunal spécial prendra fin en temps voulu. Les Nations Unies comptent aussi sur la poursuite de l’appui et de coopération du Gouvernement libanais.

- 4572 ménages assistés en articles ménagers et vivres dans les territoires de Lubero et Beni

- Près de 4 500 ménages déplacés dans le territoire de Walikale toujours sans assistance depuis juillet 2017 

**Aperçu de la situation** 

Le site de personnes déplacées de Mpati, situé au nord-ouest de Mweso dans le territoire de Masisi , a été le théâtre d’incursion d’hommes en armes durant la nuit du 13 au 14 décembre, faisant trois morts et autan de blessés. Les agresseurs ont pillé une centaine d’habitations des personnes déplacées. Cette agression est la dernière manifestation du climat d’insécurité dans lequel les civils vivent. Il est important de rappeler qu’attaquer un camp de déplacés est une violation grave du DHI (Droit Humanitaire International).  

Dans le Territoire de Masisi, la clinique mobile qui devait être organisé par l’ONG PUI dans l’aire de santé de Rugarama en ZS de Mweso a été interrompue suite aux affrontements armés du 14 décembre 2017 entre les groupes armés. Cette intervention visait à appuyer l’aire de santé de Rugarama pour faire face à l’épidémie de choléra et au paludisme déclaré dans cette zone.  
Actuellement un calme relatif est revenu dans la zone, cependant l’intervention ne reprendra qu’en janvier 2018.  

Au nord-est du territoire de Walikale, les villages de l’axe Kalonge-Pinga ont accueilli, depuis le début du mois décembre en cours, plus de 800 ménages déplacés venus du groupement Bashali-mokoto suite aux affrontements entre les miliciens dans le village Birii.

2389839,"Evaluation des connaissances, attitudes et pratiques (CAP) en eau, hygiène et assainissement (EHA) des populations touchées par la crise du Lac Tchad Région de Diffa, Niger (Septembre 2017) RESUME 

La crise dans la région du lac Tchad, débutée en 2015, continue de déstabiliser la région de Diffa au Niger et de provoquer d’importants mouvements de populations. Environ 250 000 personnes déplacées1 vivent dans des sites spontanés qui, souvent, manquent d’infrastructures de base2 , dans un contexte de crise socio-économique exerçant une pression continue sur les ressources des populations vivant dans la région. 3 De plus, le climat d’insécurité limite considérablement l’accès à l’assistance humanitaire. L’ensemble de ces facteurs conduit à une précarisation des conditions de vie des populations hôtes et déplacées, ainsi qu’à une augmentation des besoins prioritaires, y compris en Eau, Hygiène et Assainissement (EHA).  

Peu d’informations sur l’étendue des besoins en EHA dans la région de Diffa sont actuellement disponibles. Dans le but de combler ce manque d’information, REACH, en collaboration avec le Cluster WASH du Niger et en partenariat avec l’UNICEF, a mené une évaluation sur les Connaissances, Attitudes et Pratiques (CAP) en EHA des populations de la région de Diffa en septembre 2017. Cette évaluation a pris en compte à la fois les populations vivant dans les sites accueillant des déplacés et recensés par la Direction Régionale de l’Etat Civil, des Migrations et des Réfugiés (DREC), appelés ici « sites DREC », et celles des villages voisins des sites DREC, qui n’accueillent pas de populations déplacées et ne sont donc pas recensés par la DREC, appelés ici « villages non-DREC ».  

Cette évaluation s’est basée sur une méthodologie quantitative avec la réalisation d’enquêtes ménages via un questionnaire élaboré et standardisé par le cluster WASH du Niger avec le soutien de REACH. Au total, 2 909 ménages ont été interrogés, dont 1 927 dans les sites DREC et 982 dans les villages non-DREC. La collecte des données s’est reposée sur un échantillon aléatoire représentatif stratifié au niveau des communes et types de localités (DREC/non-DREC). Ceci a permis d’obtenir des résultats représentatifs aux niveaux communal et régional, ainsi qu’entre les sites DREC et les villages non-DREC. L’évaluation s’est articulée autour de quatre grandes thématiques CAP – l’accès à l’eau, l’assainissement, l’hygiène corporelle, et les maladies hydriques et leurs vecteurs de transmission. Les résultats principaux sont résumés ci-dessous :  

De manière générale, les résultats de l’évaluation dépeignent des CAP faibles pour l’ensemble des indicateurs en EHA mesurés, notamment par rapport aux standards Sphère, et niveaux régional et communal confondus. Ils tendent également à montrer que les besoins en EHA dans les zones n’accueillant pas de déplacés et plus éloignés de la crise du Lac Tchad sont plus aigus que dans les sites de déplacés. Plus précisément, les résultats de l’évaluation variaient d’une commune à l’autre, selon les thématiques. Les tendances générales suivantes peuvent néanmoins être présentées :

- Pour les communes où il n’y a que des villages non-DREC – N’Gourti, Ngueil Bely – et pour Bosso où l’accès aux sites DREC est fortement limité du fait du contexte sécuritaire, la situation en termes de EHA semble plus mauvaise. Pour N’Gourti et Ngueil Bely, ceci peut s’expliquer en partie par leur éloignement géographique de l’épicentre de la crise et donc de l’assistance humanitaire. En ce qui concerne Bosso, étant donné qu’un seul village a pu être visité, il n’est pas possible d’en tirer des conclusions.

Le CICR a étendu ses activités au Burundi tout au long de l'année.

En collaboration avec la DGAP, des légumes frais ont été produits dans les jardins pénitentiaires pour les détenus malnutris. Ce projet a connu un succès inégalé au CICR et 87% des prisonniers malnutris ont retrouvé un poids normal. Ce programme s'étendra à quatre autres prisons du Burundi en 2018.

En plus de la population carcérale, le CICR a travaillé avec la Regideso pour offrir à plus de 56'000 bénéficiaires du sud de Bujumbura un meilleur accès à l'eau potable, grâce notamment à la construction d'un réservoir de 150 m3 à Kamesa.

En deux ans, le CICR a soutenu 700 femmes cheffes de famille, sélectionnées sur la base de leur précarité et de leur projet commercial, en leur octroyant un financement conditionnel afin qu'elles relancent une activité génératrice de revenu. Le CICR finance également la rémunération de 1'000 familles vulnérables pour un travail d'un mois. Ces activités humanitaires initiées à Bujumbura s'étendront en 2018 dans quelques communes en province.

Dans le cadre de notre coopération avec la Croix-Rouge du Burundi, la préparation et la réponse aux urgences, le soutien à quatre centres de santé, la diffusion des principes et valeurs humanitaires, la plaidoirie pour le respect et la bonne utilisation de l'emblème Croix-Rouge et le rétablissement et le maintien des liens familiaux ont été au centre des activités conjointes réalisées.

D'autre part, le CICR a continué à former les corps de défense et de sécurité en droit international humanitaire et en droit international des droits de l'homme, ainsi qu'aux normes applicables dans le maintien et le rétablissement de l'ordre public. Plus de 10'000 membres des forces de l'ordre et de sécurité ont suivi des formations et l'agenda de 2018 s'annonce encore plus soutenu.

En collaboration avec les autorités du pays, l'action humanitaire du CICR se poursuivra en 2018 pour être encore plus proche des populations vulnérables.

2389204,"Réduire le taux de mortalité maternelle, néonatale et infantile au Tchad *UNICEF, OMS, FNUAP et ONUFEMMES unissent leurs efforts pour la réduction du taux de mortalité maternelle, néonatale et infantile au Tchad, un défi relevé grâce au Fonds Français Muskoka*

N’Djaména, 22 Décembre 2017 – En partenariat avec le Ministère de la Santé Publique et l’Ambassade de France au Tchad, l’UNICEF, l’OMS, le FNUAP et l’ONUFEMMES ont organisé ce vendredi 22 Décembre, un nouveau rendez-vous des medias consacré à l’impact des interventions en santé sous Fonds Français Muskoka ; un fonds destiné au renforcement des systèmes de santé dans 11 pays de l’Afrique francophone, dont le Tchad.

Depuis 2012, la France a accordé 24.8 millions d’euros au Tchad pour lutter contre la mortalité maternelle, néonatale et infantile. Des fonds qui ont servi à l’UNICEF, l’OMS et le FNUAP pour appuyer le Ministère de la Sante Publique dans la mise en œuvre d’activités à haut impact en matière notamment de planification familiale, sante de la reproduction chez les adolescents mais également de santé maternelle, néonatale et infantile.

« Le taux de mortalité maternelle, néonatale et infantile au Tchad reste l’un des plus élevés en Afrique sub-saharienne et dans le monde et le financement du Fonds Français Muskoka est une opportunité pour contribuer à la réduction de celui-ci.», a souligné Dr. Jean Bosco HULUTE, Health Manager a.i. à l’UNICEF Tchad.

Selon le rapport mondial de « Interagency Group on Mortality Estimates (IGME) » 2017, le Tchad figure parmi les 10 premiers pays dans le monde en matière de réduction du taux de décès des enfants de moins de 5 ans. Toutefois, la proportion des décès parmi les nouveau-nés reste élevée, à 35/1000 naissances vivantes. Près de 87% de décès de nouveau-nés arrivent dans les 24 premières heures résultent ainsi des complications pendant l’accouchement.

« Le FFM œuvre sans relâche à relever ce défi à travers des solutions durables telles que le renforcement des capacités du personnel de santé qui grâce aux expertises nouvelles acquises, offre un meilleur service de santé pour les mères et enfants » reconnait Dr. Abatcha KADAI, Conseiller Chargé des Politiques et Système de Sante à l’OMS Tchad.

Le FFM a poursuit en 2017 la mise en œuvre des activités préventives, curatives et promotionnelles en faveur de la santé de la mère, du nouveau-né, de l’enfant, en se focalisant plus particulièrement sur la région du Kanem comme zone de convergence pour les interventions des 3 agences des Nations Unies.

« Le Fonds Français Muskoka rend possible la mise en œuvre des interventions à haut impact, à savoir l’accès à des personnels de santé compétents, les SONU soins obstétricaux neonals d’urgence (SONU), la revue des décès maternels qui permet de sauver la vie des mères et des enfants et de ce fait améliorer les indicateurs de santé maternelle. », Dr. Olivier M. TARDA, Chargé de Programme - Santé Maternelle au FNUAP Tchad.

Selon les résultats de l’Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples (EDS-MICS) de 2014-2015, le taux de mortalité maternelle est passé de 1099 décès pour 100 000 naissances vivantes en 2004 à 860 décès pour 100 000 naissances vivantes en 2014, le taux de mortalité infantile est passé de 102 pour 1000 naissances vivantes en 2004 à 72 décès pour 1000 naissances vivantes en 2014.

Lancée en 2010 lors du sommet G8, l’initiative Muskoka est mise en œuvre à la fois via le canal bilatéral, géré par l’AFD, et le canal multilatéral, avec notamment le Fonds Français Muskoka mis en œuvre conjointement par l’UNICEF, l’OMS, l’UNFPA et ONUFEMMES dans 11 pays francophones dont le Tchad.

**1- Contexte et justifications**

La longue durée de présence des réfugiés centrafricains et soudanais au Tchad (plus de 14 ans pour certains) et la réduction des financements accordés pour leur fournir une assistance alimentaire et non alimentaire au cours des dernières années ont amené la communauté humanitaire à revoir les stratégies d’assistance de ces populations. Le PAM et l’UNHCR qui sont les principaux partenaires du Gouvernement dans la fourniture de l’assistance humanitaire aux réfugiés ont réalisé une catégorisation socioéconomique en 2014 et 2015 dans certains camps de réfugiés du sud et du sud-est avec la participation de la CNARR. Sur la base des leçons apprises de cette précédente opération, la JAM de 2016 a recommandé de faire une mise à jour en 2017. Cette mise à jour a été conçue pour aller au-delà d’une simple catégorisation et vise principalement l’identification des profils des ménages réfugiés pouvant s’autonomiser à court ou à moyen termes ainsi que les facteurs pouvant favoriser cette autonomisation. Les résultats du profilage devront servir à l’élaboration d’une nouvelle approche stratégique dans la réponse apportée aux besoins des réfugiés. Il a été retenu d’inclure dans l’analyse les réfugiés nigérians et centrafricains arrivés plus récemment mais qui pourraient à terme se trouver aussi confrontés aux mêmes réalités et difficultés.",268,"French"
2389079,"Des mines aux bancs l’école : l’histoire de Akim Le travail des enfants dans les mines et carrières d’exploitation artisanale en République Démocratique du Congo reste un défi majeur. Le gouvernement Congolais s’est engagé à une éradication du travail des enfants, mais les moyens restent limités face à l’ampleur du problème. Aucune étude quantitative n’est venue encore apporter des précisions sur le nombre d’enfants impliqués, mais les estimations faites en 2012 portent le nombre d’enfants dans les mines artisanales à environ 40.000 dont une grande partie sur la ceinture de cuivre et de cobalt dans le Haut-Katanga et dans le Lualaba.  

Le village de Luisha, dans le territoire de Kambove, Province du Haut-Katanga est l’une de ces régions où des enfants se retrouvent dans les mines artisanales.  Ils constituent une main d’œuvre à bon marché et facilement exploitable. Leur taille leur permet de descendre dans des puits miniers plus difficilement accessibles aux adultes.  Ils s’occupent aussi de lavage, de triage et de transport des minerais.  C’est une situation en violation flagrante des conventions internationales sur la protection de l’enfant, de même que des lois nationales.

Akim* est l’aîné de sa famille.  Il confie avoir commencé à aller dans les mines artisanales à cause de la situation financière difficile de sa famille. Ses parents travaillent aussi dans les mines, mais leurs revenus ne suffisent pas à subvenir aux besoins alimentaires d’une famille de 5 enfants, et encore moins aux exigences en santé et en scolarisation.

Ce qu’Akim rapportait dans sa famille faisait donc une grande différence dans le budget alimentaire de la famille, même si cela était loin de suffire pour envoyer ses frères et sœurs à l’école. Ainsi, il partait courageusement tous les jours vers les carrières et travaillait aussi dur qu’il le pouvait pour rapporter quelque chose chez lui.  

Il a plusieurs fois été malade mais a pu toujours se rétablir pour continuer son travail dans les mines. Il a été aussi à plusieurs reprises le témoin des blessures encourues par d’autres compagnons de son âge, travaillant dans les mines pour les mêmes raisons que lui. Depuis qu’il travaille dans les mines, Akim est privé de son enfance.

**Un futur encore possible grâce à l’école**

Akim avait portant de grands rêves. Il voulait aller à l’école et devenir médecin ! Grâce à l’intervention de l’UNICEF, Akim se rapproche de son rêve : il a quitté les mines et est inscrit dans une école communautaire.

Pour assurer la pérennisation de son éducation, ses parents ont été invités à se constituer en association avec d’autres parents, travaillant en concertation avec le Réseau Communautaire de Protection de l’Enfant (RECOPE). Ils ont mis en place des activités agricoles de maïs et de cultures maraîchères sur 3 hectares de terre, mis à leur disposition par les autorités locales.

Grâce à cela, les parents d’Akim ont pu continuer à payer les frais scolaires pour lui mais aussi inscrire les autres enfants de la famille ! Ils sont contents que leurs enfants puissent échapper aux travail infernal des mines et être sur les bancs de l’école.

Akim est heureux de retourner à l’école mais reste troublé de voir encore beaucoup de ses camarades dans les mines de Luisha.  Il demande l’implication du Gouvernement, des acteurs de la société civile et des compagnies minières pour que les enfants de Luisha puissent quitter les mines pour l’école !

Tout le monde a un rêve et tout le monde a le droit à son rêve.

**Le travail de l’UNICEF dans les mines du Katanga**

L’UNICEF RDC agit en faveur de la protection des enfants dans la Province du Haut-Katanga à travers le renforcement du système de protection communautaire.  Tout en ayant un fort accent sur le travail des enfants dans les mines à cause de la particularité de la zone, ce système de protection communautaire permet adresser différents enjeux de protection : violences sur les enfants, enregistrement de naissance, mariage d’enfants, trafic d’enfants, violences sexuelles, etc.

Ce programme géré en partenariat avec la Division des affaires sociales (DIVAS) est financé avec des fonds du Comité National Suisse pour l’UNICEF et les fonds propres de l’UNICEF.",268,"French"

2388909,"Music For Life : le gouvernement fédéral mobilise 100.000 euros pour des projets en faveur des droits de l’Homme au Burundi et en Tunisie Le vice-Premier ministre et ministre de la Coopération au Développement Alexander De Croo fait un don de 100.000 euros à l’opération de récolte de fonds « de Warmste Week ». La somme sera affectée à un projet de soutien aux victimes de la traite des êtres humains en Tunisie (Avocats sans Frontières) et à l’amélioration des droits des jeunes au Burundi (KIYO). Le ministre De Croo a remis le chèque ce matin à Music For Life. L’opération se déroule cette année au Domaine Puyenbroeck de Wachtebeke en Flandre orientale.

Avocats sans Frontières utilisera les 50.000 euros pour mieux protéger les victimes de la traite des êtres humains en Tunisie. L’ONG s’y attèlera en lançant des campagnes de sensibilisation sur le trafic des êtres humains, en créant des centres pour les victimes et en formant des avocats spécialisés dans ce domaine.

**Tabou**

“Les images de CNN montrant des migrants africains vendus comme esclaves en Libye nous ont récemment confrontés à la réalité du trafic des êtres humains. Il est essentiel de mieux protéger les victimes de ce fléau et de les aider à défendre leurs droits. C’est le travail que fait Avocats sans Frontières”, a déclaré Alexander De Croo.

En Tunisie, les victimes du trafic des êtres humains, souvent des enfants, sont particulièrement vulnérables au travail forcé, à l’exploitation domestique ou à la prostitution. Le pays a certes accompli des avancées législatives importantes ces dernières années, mais le problème reste tabou. La population est mal informée sur le sujet et les victimes hésitent à témoigner.

“Notre campagne de sensibilisation lancée il y a quelques mois a déjà porté ses fruits et fait évoluer les mentalités des gens. Cette aide supplémentaire nous permet d’encore renforcer nos activités : nous pourrons cartographier le phénomène de la traite des êtres humains en Tunisie, réaliser un documentaire et concevoir un site internet de référence”, a indiqué Chantal van Cutsem, directrice générale d’ASF.
 
**Des citoyens qui font entendre leur voix**

L’autre tranche de 50.000 euros ira à un projet de l’ONG KIYO qui mise au Burundi sur l’autonomisation socio-économique des jeunes. “Au Burundi, plus de 800.0000 enfants vivent dans des conditions très précaires. En donnant plus de chances aux jeunes et en les formant pour qu’ils deviennent des travailleurs qualifiés, des entrepreneurs actifs et des citoyens capables de faire entendre leur voix, ils seront plus autonomes et pourront contribuer activement à la reconstruction du pays”, a affirmé Alexander De Croo.

Concrètement, KIYO accompagnera et formera, dans huit quartiers de Bujumbura et de Gitega, des jeunes vivant de la rue ou qui sont exclus du système scolaire. Avec des compétences techniques et la confiance en eux, les jeunes pourront se construire un avenir et aussi avoir l’opportunité de s’engager dans leur quartier et contribuer à la reconstruction pacifique de leur pays où les droits de l’Homme et la démocratie sont très fragiles.

“Nous nous réjouissons du soutien du ministre De Croo en faveur de notre projet au Burundi. Nous pourrons ainsi donner à des jeunes burundais la perspective d’un emploi et un coup de pouce pour un meilleur avenir. Cela profitera aussi bien aux jeunes qu’à l’ensemble du pays”, a déclaré Iris Bogaerts, directrice exécutive de KIYO.

**Les droits humains, une priorité**

“Dans le cadre de sa politique en matière de développement international, la Belgique se concentre beaucoup sur l’amélioration des droits humains auprès de groupes vulnérables.

2388679,"Le chemin pour rentrer : Comment la ligne verte burundaise a aidé une victime d’enlèvement à rentrer dans son pays **Par Hannah Powell Losada**

Burundi - Egide* est un riziculteur d'un village rural de l'ouest du Burundi. Chaque soir, il retourne chez lui après de longues heures de travail dans les champs. Mais il y a une nuit qu'il n'oubliera jamais.

Un soir d'avril 2017, un groupe d'hommes armés a attaqué le taxi dans lequel Egide se trouvait, tirant sur les roues et soufflant un des pneus. Les hommes ont démonté Egide avec véhémence de la voiture, lui ont bandé les yeux et l'ont conduit pendant environ une heure jusqu'à ce qu'il crût être en République du Congo (RDC). Les hommes armés ont laissé Egide quitter la voiture et marcher le reste du chemin les yeux bandés.Home Picture Egide

""Je me souviens d'avoir traversé une rivière, c'était profond et tous mes vêtements étaient mouillés. La seule rivière que je connais comme celle-ci est celle qui sépare le Burundi de la RDC”, se rappelle Egide. À la fin de son périple et toujours les yeux bandés, Egide et ses ravisseurs ont atteint un bâtiment où il a été gardé dans une petite chambre vide.

Bien qu’Egide ne sache pas pourquoi, il était la cible. L'enlèvement est chose fréquente dans la région où vit Egide, car les groupes rebelles armés et les bandits de la région du Kivu au RDC utilisent la rançon versée par les familles pour récupérer leurs proches comme une source régulière de revenus.

Après l'attaque, de retour au Burundi, le chauffeur de taxi est allé à la maison d'Egide et a informé sa femme de l'enlèvement. Paniquée, la femme d'Egide appella ses amis et sa famille, demandant ce qu'elle pouvait faire pour retrouver son mari. Une de ses amies, une bénévole d'une ONG locale, avait entendu parler d'une ligne verte nationale, qui fournit des informations et de l'aide aux communautés vulnérables depuis le début de la crise politique au Burundi. Il conseilla à Diane*, l'épouse d'Egide, de composer le code 109 pour contacter la ligne verte afin obtenir de l’aide.

Un opérateur de la ligne verte écouta ce qui arriva à Egide et utilisa son expérience avec d'autres affaires d'enlèvement pour guider Diane à travers le processus de rançon. Les opérateurs de la ligne verte guidèrent Diane sur la façon de parler avec les ravisseurs afin de maximiser les chances de survie d'Egide. Ils restèrent en contact à chaque instant, jusqu'à ce que la libération d'Egide ait été négociée avec succès. Une fois informé qu'Egide avait été libéré, Diane et un policier local partirent à sa recherche jusqu'à ce qu'ils le retrouvèrent. Il était déshydraté, faible et effrayé près de la rivière qu'il avait initialement croisée avec ses kidnappeurs. Dans un état d'intense anxiété, il avait passé environ dix jours dans une pièce vide. Avec pour seule nourriture une patate douce par jour que ses ravisseurs lui avaient donnée et buvant l'eau d’une flaque sale se trouvant dans sa chambre.

Une fois qu'Egide fut en sécurité, la ligne verte l'envoya à une organisation locale afin de recevoir un traitement contre la déshydratation et la faim. L'information et l'assistance fournies par le numéro 109 ont permis à la famille d'Egide de répondre efficacement à la situation d'enlèvement. Jacqueline*, une des opératrices de la ligne verte, estime que son travail à la ligne verte est essentiel pour aider les Burundais en situation de crise et est heureuse de faire partie de l'équipe qui travaille ensemble pour gérer la ligne verte et offrir un soutien continu aux appelants.

Lancée en octobre 2015, cette ligne verte est une coopération interinstitutionnelle de l'Organisation Internationale pour les Migrations (OIM), la Croix-Rouge du Burundi, le Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires des Nations Unies (OCHA), Vision du Monde (WVI) et Caritas Burundi. Au cours des deux dernières années, la ligne verte a répondu à plus de 6300 appelants des quatre coins du pays, consultables en ligne via [Community Response Map Burundi.](http://burundi.communityresponsemap.org/node/20507)

Aujourd'hui, les opérateurs de la ligne verte continuent à travailler afin d'établir un lien entre Egide et d'autres victimes aux principaux services d'urgence. Assurant ainsi une bouée de sauvetage aux communautés vulnérables du Burundi et leur permettant de bénéficier d'une aide d'urgence et d'une protection contre la violence.

NAIROBI, 13 décembre 2017

Lutter contre le changement climatique n’a jamais été aussi urgent. Il existe pourtant un élément de solution dont l’efficacité a été prouvée. Dépêchons-nous de l’adopter. Le concept radical (mais pas nouveau) de l’agroforesterie — qu’il s’agisse de planter des arbres pour faire de l’ombre aux plants de café, d’en intégrer aux fermes d’élevage colombiennes ou de favoriser la multiplication des karités dans les champs de millet au Sahel — doit faire partie de nos priorités.

Il s’agissait globalement de  présenter le projet, d’informer les bénéficiaires, les partenaires d’exécution et les bailleurs de fonds sur la mise en œuvre du projet sur les sites retenus.

À l’ouverture de la séance, la coordonnatrice de l’ONG ACTED, Mme Hélène Camus, a rappelé les différentes étapes du projet, soulignant, par ailleurs, que « la réintégration communautaire sera axée sur le renforcement et le développement des capacités professionnelles techniques des démobilisés… »

Plus concrètement, les activités induites par ladite Réintégration consisteront en l’appui aux activités génératrices de revenus telles que la mécanique, la soudure, l’électricité, la menuiserie, la conduite automobile, l’agriculture, l’élevage, le commerce, la couture, la bureautique, etc., aux subventions de projets en matière de relèvement de la communauté (construction et réhabilitation des infrastructures de base) et aux activités de réconciliation.

Félicitant l’ONG ACTED « qui a accepté de jouer le rôle d’organisme d’exécution du projet», le coordonnateur de l’UEPNDDRR, le Colonel Noel Selesson, a fait savoir que « dans le domaine de la restauration de l’autorité de l’État, la problématique du désarmement constitue une priorité du Président de la République », car, a-t-il précisé, « les armes illégalement détenues par les groupes armés constituent une menace pour la stabilité et le développement».

Il est à noter que cette réintégration communautaire est rendue possible grâce à l’appui de la Banque mondiale

Rappelons que le DDRR a pour objectif de réduire le nombre d’armes en circulation ; de désarmer ceux qui les portent et par conséquent de diminuer les menaces que constituent les groupes armés. Grâce à sa division éponyme, la MINUSCA appuie ce processus par des financements, l’assistance technique et logistique, ainsi que la coordination de l’opération.",268,"French"
2388494,"Le MOC et la MINUSMA coordonnent leurs efforts pour sécuriser la population de Gao Des patrouilles coordonnées entre le MOC et la MINUSMA sont organisées de jour comme de nuit, pour renforcer la sécurité des personnes et de leurs biens dans la ville de Gao

Le mercredi 20 décembre 2017, les éléments du Mécanisme Opérationnel de Coordination (MOC) et les Casques bleus de la MINUSMA, se sont rassemblés au petit matin devant le Camp MOC pour commencer à coordonner une patrouille. Objectif : assurer la sécurité de la ville et rassurer ses habitants. « Nous allons coordonner nos efforts ensemble, avec le MOC, pour patrouiller dans trois quartiers de la ville, » a lancé l’adjudant Papa Malick Fall, du contingent sénégalais de la Mission onusienne après une brève consultation avec le lieutenant-colonel Oumar Abba Soumaré, chef du bureau régional du MOC-Gao.

Le MOC est une structure prévue par l’Accord pour la Paix et la Réconciliation au Mali, issu du processus d’Alger dans son annexe II, consacrée aux questions de Défense et de Sécurité. Il relève de la Commission Technique de Sécurité (CTS), présidée par le Commandant des Forces de la MINUSMA. Il a été créé le 1er octobre 2015, suite à l’approbation des termes de référence par la Commission Technique de Sécurité composée des représentants des groupes armés et du gouvernement malien. Dès l’adoption de ses termes de référence, le MOC a débuté ses activités c’était le 7 octobre 2015.

Une réponse adéquate à une situation complexe…

A Gao, la situation sécuritaire est volatile. S’adressant à la presse pour la première fois depuis sa nomination au poste de Gouverneur de la Région, le colonel-major Sidiki Samaké, a déclaré que le rétablissement de la sécurité est sa priorité. Ce type de patrouilles coordonnées entre le MOC et les Casques bleus de la MINUSMA rassurent les populations et, de par leur régularité apparaissent comme un élément hautement dissuasif sur le terrain. Les patrouilles sont louées en de nombreuses occasions par les populations, elles sont un « pas important pour mettre fin à l’insécurité dans la ville,» a déclaré M. Mohamed Ben Maouloud Bouya, premier adjoint au Maire de la commune urbaine de Gao.

Ainsi, selon M. Abderhamane Cissé, Directeur Régional de la Jeunesse et des Sports les habitants de la Cité des Askia ont souhaité « cette coordination pour qu’elles puissent dormir en paix et en sécurité ». « Le MOC c’est l’image de la paix, de la cohésion sociale et de l’unité, car il regroupe tous les mouvements signataires de l’Accord pour la Paix et la Réconciliation, issu du processus d’Alger.  Le succès de sa mission signifie la réussite de sa mise en œuvre, » selon M.

CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ   
8149E SÉANCE – APRÈS-MIDI  

Le Conseil de sécurité a, dans une déclaration présidentielle adoptée cet après-midi, souligné la nécessité d’accroître l’efficacité des opérations de maintien de la paix de l’ONU en vue de renforcer leur rôle dans l’instauration d’une paix durable. 

Le Conseil insiste ainsi sur le fait qu’une « direction efficace et dynamique » de ces opérations peut contribuer à la mise en œuvre d’une stratégie de pérennisation de la paix.  Il importe également de doter les opérations de « mandats clairs, réalisables, mis en œuvre progressivement ou par phases successives », insiste le Conseil.

Les membres du Conseil soulignent également que la mise en œuvre effective des mandats passe par le déploiement de soldats de la paix « compétents, qualifiés et expérimentés », qui répondent aux plus hautes normes et respectent la politique de tolérance zéro de l’ONU à l’égard des écarts de conduite et des cas d’exploitation et d’atteintes sexuelles. 

Dans cette déclaration, le Conseil appelle à un renforcement de la collaboration avec les pays fournisseurs des contingents et de personnel de police.  La planification des opérations doit être améliorée, notamment « en prenant de plus nombreux engagements en matière de capacités », d’éléments habilitants, d’unités médicales et d’unités du génie et de déploiement rapide.

Le Conseil exprime en outre son intention, lors de l’examen des mandats, d’envisager une évaluation desdits mandats dans toutes ses dimensions, « y compris la coopération de l’État hôte » et la définition claire de buts et objectifs.

Le Conseil envisage en outre de se pencher sur la « quantité et la qualité des résultats obtenus » dans l’exécution cohérente des mandats, sur une définition précise du rôle desdites opérations et sur une stratégie de sortie visant à jeter les bases d’une paix solide et durable. 

Enfin, le Conseil indique que la « préservation de la paix » doit se comprendre comme les activités permettant de prévenir le déclenchement, l’intensification, la poursuite ou la récurrence de conflits, de s’attaquer à leurs causes profondes, d’aider les parties à mettre fin aux hostilités, de veiller à la réconciliation nationale et de s’engager sur la voie du relèvement. 

OPÉRATIONS DE MAINTIEN DE LA PAIX DES NATIONS UNIES

Déclaration du Président du Conseil de sécurité

Le Conseil de sécurité rappelle ses résolutions 1645 (2005), 2086 (2013), 2282 (2016) et les déclarations de son président PRST/2009/24, PRST/2011/17, PRST/2012/29 et PRST/2015/22.

Le Conseil réaffirme qu’il tient de la Charte des Nations Unies la responsabilité principale du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales et qu’il est déterminé à ce que les buts et principes consacrés dans la Charte, y compris les principes de l’indépendance politique, de l’égalité souveraine et de l’intégrité territoriale de tous les États, qu’il respecte et auxquels il est attaché, soient observés dans toutes les activités de maintien et de consolidation de la paix, et que les États doivent s’acquitter des obligations que leur fait le droit international.

Le Conseil est conscient que la « pérennisation de la paix », au sens qui lui est donné dans le rapport du Groupe consultatif d’experts, devrait être comprise au sens large comme étant un objectif et un processus tendant à la définition d’une vision commune d’une société, en faisant en sorte que les besoins de tous les groupes de la population soient pris en compte, ce qui suppose des activités permettant de prévenir le déclenchement, l’intensification, la poursuite ou la récurrence de conflits, de s’attaquer à leurs causes profondes, d’aider les parties à mettre fin aux hostilités, de veiller à la réconciliation nationale et de s’engager sur la voie du relèvement, de la reconstruction et du développement, et souligne que la pérennisation de la paix constitue une tâche et une responsabilité partagées que doivent assumer le gouvernement et toutes les autres parties prenantes nationales, qu’elle devrait être reflétée dans chacun des trois piliers de la stratégie d’engagement des Nations Unies à tous les stades du conflit, et dans toutes ses dimensions, et qu’elle requiert l’attention et l’assistance constantes de la communauté internationale.

Le Conseil réaffirme l’engagement qu’il a pris d’améliorer l’efficacité de l’action que mène l’Organisation des Nations Unies à toutes les étapes des conflits, de la prévention au règlement puis à la consolidation de la paix et estime en outre qu’il importe de définir des mesures adaptées à chaque contexte, en ayant recours aux divers instruments dont dispose l’ONU pour maintenir la paix et la sécurité internationales.

Le Conseil réaffirme qu’il revient en premier lieu aux autorités et aux gouvernements nationaux de recenser, déterminer et cibler les priorités, les stratégies et les activités axées sur la pérennisation de la paix et, à cet égard, souligne que l’inclusivité, notamment la participation pleine et entière des femmes, est essentielle pour faire avancer les processus nationaux et servir les objectifs de consolidation de la paix des pays afin de faire en sorte que les besoins de tous les groupes de la société soient pris en compte.

Le Conseil réaffirme qu’il importe que les activités de consolidation de la paix soient prises en main et dirigées par le pays concerné, sachant que la responsabilité de la pérennisation de la paix incombe aussi bien au gouvernement qu’aux autres parties prenantes nationales.

Le Conseil souligne que la primauté du politique devrait être la clef de voûte de la stratégie de l’Organisation des Nations Unies en matière de règlement des conflits, qui doit être fondée notamment sur la médiation, le contrôle du respect des cessez-le-feu et la fourniture d’une aide pour l’application des accords de paix.

Le Conseil réaffirme également les principes fondamentaux du maintien de la paix, notamment le consentement des parties, l’impartialité et le non-recours à la force, sauf en cas de légitime défense ou de défense du mandat, considère que le mandat de chaque mission de maintien de la paix doit être adapté aux besoins et à la situation du pays concerné, et escompte l’exécution intégrale des mandats qu’il autorise.

Le Conseil se félicite du rôle que jouent les opérations de maintien de la paix dans la mise en œuvre d’une stratégie globale visant à instaurer durablement la paix et la sécurité, rappelle également leur rôle décisif pour ce qui est de maintenir la paix et la sécurité internationales, de prévenir et de maîtriser les conflits, de faire respecter les normes internationales, d’appliquer ses décisions et de consolider la paix après les conflits, et leur contribution à la protection des civils. Il rappelle en outre que c’est aux États qu’il incombe au premier chef de protéger les civils ainsi que de respecter et de garantir les droits de l’homme de toutes les personnes qui se trouvent sur leur territoire et relèvent de leur juridiction, comme le prescrit le droit international applicable.

Le Conseil de sécurité rappelle que le maintien de la paix va des missions traditionnelles, axées surtout sur la surveillance de cessez-le-feu, à des opérations multidimensionnelles complexes, chargées de mener des activités de consolidation de la paix et de remédier aux causes profondes des conflits.

Le Conseil insiste sur le fait qu’une direction efficace et dynamique des opérations des Nations Unies dans un pays peut contribuer à rassembler les organismes du système autour d’une stratégie commune de pérennisation de la paix et, à cet égard, souligne que pour accroître l’efficacité et l’efficience des activités de consolidation de la paix les plus cruciales, il faut renforcer la coordination, la cohérence et l’intégration des efforts déployés dans ce domaine, y compris par les missions et les équipes de pays des Nations Unies ainsi que par les acteurs nationaux, régionaux et internationaux du développement.

Le Conseil est conscient de la nécessité d’envisager toutes les réactions possibles lorsqu’il se penche sur une situation risquant de menacer la paix et la sécurité internationales, et de ne déployer de missions de maintien de la paix qu’en complément, et non en remplacement d’une stratégie politique tenant compte, entre autres, des causes profondes du conflit.

Le Conseil sait que pour être efficaces, les activités de consolidation de la paix doivent bénéficier du soutien de l’ensemble du système des Nations Unies et, à cet égard, souligne que la réalisation d’analyses conjointes et la planification de stratégies efficaces par tous les organismes du système sont importantes du point de vue de leur engagement à long terme dans les pays touchés par un conflit et, le cas échéant, de leur coopération avec les organisations régionales et sous-régionales et de la coordination de leur action avec celle de ces dernières.

Le Conseil se félicite du rôle que jouent les opérations de maintien de la paix dans la mise en œuvre d’une stratégie globale de pérennisation de la paix et prend note avec satisfaction de la contribution que les soldats de la paix et les missions de maintien de la paix apportent aux efforts de consolidation de la paix.

Le Conseil de sécurité souligne que les analyses intégrées des opportunités et des défis pour la pérennisation de la paix sont utiles afin de définir une vision claire des solutions adaptées aux pays sortant d’un conflit, vision qui devrait sous-tendre la planification intégrée des missions de maintien de la paix.

Le Conseil souligne qu’il importe d’appréhender les difficultés que présenteront la consolidation et la pérennisation de la paix dès la création des missions de maintien de la paix, grâce à des opérations d’évaluation et de planification stratégiques intégrées, de manière à conjuguer de manière cohérente maintien de la paix et consolidation de la paix, afin que l’action menée au sortir du conflit soit immédiatement efficace.

Le Conseil souligne qu’il importe d’envisager des mandats clairs, réalisables, mis en œuvre progressivement ou par phases successives, le cas échéant, s’appuyant sur une analyse et une planification renforcées, lorsqu’il s’agit d’évaluer les opérations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies en cours ou d’en créer de nouvelles. Il souligne en outre qu’il importe de compléter les efforts de consolidation et de pérennisation de la paix déployés par les autorités nationales et locales, ainsi que par l’ONU et d’autres partenaires, tout au long du cycle de vie d’une mission et en tant que composante importante de la planification en vue du retrait et de la sortie, afin de renforcer les capacités et les mécanismes nationaux.

Le Conseil souligne que la mise en œuvre effective des mandats passe par le déploiement de soldats de la paix et de personnel compétents, qualifiés et expérimentés, qui répondent aux plus hautes normes et respectent la politique de tolérance zéro de l’Organisation à l’égard des écarts de conduite et des cas d’exploitation et d’atteintes sexuelles, et rappelle à cet égard ses résolutions pertinentes et celles de l’Assemblée générale. Il salue le rôle précieux que jouent les pays fournisseurs de contingents ou de personnel de police et les engage, dans un esprit de partenariat, à continuer de fournir du personnel militaire et des policiers professionnels dotés des compétences et de l’expérience nécessaires pour exécuter des mandats de maintien de la paix, et notamment des compétences linguistiques voulues si leur rang l’exige.

Le Conseil constate que la collaboration et les consultations avec les pays qui fournissent des contingents et du personnel de police doit encore être renforcée, notamment au moyen d’échanges triangulaires entre lui-même, les fournisseurs de contingents et de personnel de police et le Secrétariat concernant les zones où les contingents militaires et les unités de police participent aux premiers efforts de consolidation de la paix, et engage toutes les parties prenantes à participer activement à des consultations ouvertes et plus fréquentes visant à améliorer l’exécution des tâches de consolidation de la paix sur le terrain.

Le Conseil souligne qu’il faut accroître l’efficacité générale des opérations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies, à toutes les étapes de l’exécution des mandats, en améliorant la planification des missions, en prenant de plus nombreux engagements en matière de capacités, notamment en ce qui concerne la fourniture de capacités spécialisées, y compris facilitatrices, d’unités médicales et d’unités du génie et de déploiement rapide, et en renforçant l’efficacité des opérations de maintien de la paix par le biais de la formation, et qu’il faut donner suite aux engagements pris par un certain nombre d’États Membres lors des diverses réunions multilatérales tenues en 2015, 2016 et 2017 pour les opérations de maintien de la paix.

Le Conseil considère qu’il importe que les composantes consolidation de la paix des opérations de maintien de la paix et des missions politiques spéciales des Nations Unies reçoivent les ressources dont elles ont besoin, y compris pendant les phases de transition et de réduction des effectifs, afin de garantir la continuité et la durabilité des activités de consolidation de la paix.

Le Conseil rappelle sa résolution 2320 (2016) et souligne qu’il importe de forger des partenariats et de coopérer avec les organisations et les accords régionaux et sous-régionaux, y compris l’Union africaine, visés au Chapitre VIII de la Charte des Nations Unies, afin qu’ils appuient les activités de maintien de la paix et de consolidation de la paix, et reconnaît à cet égard les efforts consentis par l’Union africaine, qui a déployé des opérations de paix autorisées par ce conseil et mis en œuvre sa politique de reconstruction et de développement après un conflit, ainsi que ses initiatives pertinentes, en particulier l’Initiative africaine de solidarité, et prend note de la décision AU/Dec.351 (XVI) prise par l’Assemblée de l’Union de créer un centre de l’Union africaine pour la reconstruction et le développement postconflit.

Le Conseil reconnaît qu’il importe d’établir une coordination, une cohérence et une coopération fortes avec la Commission de consolidation de la paix, conformément à ses résolutions 1645 (2005) et 2282 (2016) et, à cet égard, compte solliciter régulièrement les conseils spécialisés, stratégiques et ciblés de la Commission, les examiner et s’en inspirer, y compris pour ce qui est d’avoir une vision à long terme propice à la pérennisation de la paix lors de la création, de l’examen ou de la réduction du mandat d’une opération de maintien de la paix ou d’une mission politique spéciale.

Le Conseil insiste sur le fait qu’il importe de prendre conseil auprès de la Commission de consolidation de la paix lorsqu’un accord important relatif au mandat ou à la transition d’une mission des Nations Unies est en passe d’être conclu entre l’Organisation, un gouvernement ou des autorités nationales et toute autre partie concernée.

Le Conseil exprime son intention d’envisager, lors de l’examen des mandats et de la configuration des missions de maintien de la paix, quand et s’il y a lieu et au cas par cas, les éléments ci-après liés à la consolidation et à la pérennisation de la paix:

I.    Une évaluation de l’exécution du mandat dans toutes ses dimensions, y compris la coopération de l’État hôte, en vue d’assurer l’exécution intégrale des activités prescrites ainsi que, le cas échéant, l’ajustement des tâches, pour mieux contribuer à la consolidation et la pérennisation de la paix;

II.   L’appui à un processus de consultation, au sein de la mission, qui soutienne et renforce l’appropriation nationale des processus politiques; l’utilisation, au sein de la mission, de bons offices et des compétences techniques nécessaires pour appuyer les processus politiques nationaux;

III.  L’existence de buts et d’objectifs clairement définis, orientés selon des critères précis, convenus aux fins de la consolidation et de la pérennisation de la paix;

IV.   Une analyse stratégique et intégrée, menée périodiquement, des possibilités qui s’offrent aux autorités nationales et locales, ainsi que des risques et des difficultés qu’elles rencontrent, pour instaurer et pérenniser la paix, y compris les problèmes liés à l’édification et au renforcement de capacités nationales à cette fin;

V.    La quantité et la qualité des résultats obtenus dans l’exécution cohérente des aspects politiques et opérationnels du mandat de la mission, en coordination avec l’équipe de pays des Nations Unies et en collaboration avec d’autres partenaires régionaux et internationaux pertinents, y compris les institutions financières;

VI.   La répartition précise des rôles et des attributions qui reviennent aux opérations de maintien de la paix, aux équipes de pays des Nations Unies et aux autres intervenants, notamment les entités pertinentes qui concourent à la consolidation de la paix et les organismes, fonds et programmes des Nations Unies, dans le cadre de leurs mandats, en ce qui concerne l’apport au pays hôte d’un appui ciblé qui réponde aux besoins et priorités de consolidation de la paix de ce pays, tels qu’ils ont été définis par les autorités nationales, afin d’assurer une réelle intégration des efforts et d’appuyer le travail accompli pour lutter contre les causes profondes des conflits;

VII.  L’existence d’une stratégie de sortie qui vise à contribuer à jeter les bases d’une paix solide et durable, notamment par le renforcement des capacités nationales, avec le soutien, le cas échéant, d’acteurs bilatéraux, régionaux et internationaux, y compris les institutions financières internationales.

Le Conseil prend note de l’intention exprimée par le Secrétaire général de procéder à des examens des missions de maintien de la paix et prie celui-ci de rendre compte, selon qu’il conviendra, dans ses rapports sur la question, des résultats de l’analyse des progrès accomplis dans les éléments susmentionnés et des recommandations formulées à cet égard.

CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ

On trouvera ci-après le texte de la déclaration à la presse faite, aujourd’hui, par le Président du Conseil de sécurité pour le mois de décembre, M. Koro Bessho (Japon):

Les membres du Conseil de sécurité ont rappelé les résolutions [2100 (2013)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2100(2013)) du 25 avril 2013, [2113 (2013)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2113(2013)) du 30 juillet 2013, [2245 (2015)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2245(2015)) du 9 novembre 2015, [2348 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2348(2017)) du 31 mars 2017 et [2387 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2387(2017)) du 15 novembre 2017, dans lesquelles le Conseil a réitéré l’importance de tenir compte des effets que les opérations de maintien de la paix qu’il mandate ont sur l’environnement, et de les gérer.  Ils ont également rappelé la déclaration [S/PRST/2011/15](https://undocs.org/fr/S/PRST/2011/15) faite par leur président le 20 juillet 2011.

Les membres du Conseil ont à l’esprit les buts et principes énoncés dans la Charte des Nations Unies et le fait que celle-ci confie au Conseil la responsabilité principale du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales.

Les membres du Conseil ont réaffirmé les principes fondamentaux du maintien de la paix, notamment le consentement des parties, l’impartialité et le non-recours à la force, sauf en cas de légitime défense ou de défense du mandat, et considéré que le mandat de chaque mission de maintien de la paix doit être adapté aux besoins et à la situation du pays concerné, et que le Conseil escompte l’exécution intégrale des mandats qu’il autorise.

Les membres du Conseil savent que les opérations de maintien de la paix mandatées par le Conseil peuvent avoir un impact sur l’environnement.  Ils ont souligné qu’il importait qu’elles s’efforcent de réduire au minimum leur incidence sur la viabilité des écosystèmes des zones où elles sont déployées, sur la base d’un examen solide des risques, des avantages et des coûts.

Les membres du Conseil ont déclaré que les modalités d’interaction des opérations de maintien de la paix avec l’environnement des zones où elles sont déployées peuvent les aider à exécuter leur mandat avec efficacité et efficience.

Ayant à l’esprit les objectifs fixés par les accords internationaux sur l’environnement, notamment l’Accord de Paris, les membres du Conseil ont exprimé le souhait que les missions de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies, en pleine conformité avec les mandats établis, continuent de se préoccuper de réduire leur impact sur l’environnement, conformément aux résolutions pertinentes de l’Assemblée générale et aux règles et règlements applicables de l’Organisation.

Les membres du Conseil ont indiqué qu’il importait d’examiner à fond l’impact des opérations de maintien de la paix sur l’environnement, en étroite coordination avec les parties concernées, notamment les pays fournisseurs de contingents ou de personnel de police, dans le cadre des réunions du Groupe de travail du Conseil de sécurité sur les opérations de maintien de la paix et des organes compétents de l’Assemblée générale.

Les membres du Conseil ont déclaré que le souci de l’environnement nécessitait de tenir compte des effets des activités des opérations de maintien de la paix sur le patrimoine historique et culturel des zones de déploiement et de la possibilité que les couches de la population soient touchées différemment par la dégradation de l’environnement.

Les membres du Conseil ont noté avec satisfaction que le Secrétaire général avait renforcé son engagement dans ce domaine.

Les membres du Conseil ont encouragé les États Membres à incorporer, le cas échéant, des directives environnementales dans leurs programmes nationaux de formation des militaires et du personnel de police en prévision de leur déploiement dans des opérations de maintien de la paix de l’ONU.  Ils ont également prié le Secrétaire général de continuer à faire en sorte que le personnel civil déployé dans des opérations de maintien de la paix reçoive une formation similaire.

Les membres du Conseil ont invité le Secrétaire général ainsi que les pays fournisseurs de contingents et de personnel de police, selon qu’il conviendra et dans les limites des ressources existantes, à partager avec les États hôtes et les autorités locales des pratiques optimales de gestion de l’environnement.

Les membres du Conseil ont demandé aux États Membres, et plus particulièrement aux États accueillant des missions de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies, de faciliter les efforts des soldats de la paix visant à réduire l’impact environnemental des missions de maintien de la paix.

CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ   
8150E SÉANCE – APRÈS-MIDI

Juste après l’adoption d’une déclaration de son président soulignant la nécessité d’accroître l’efficacité des opérations de maintien de la paix de l’ONU en vue d’assurer une paix durable, le Conseil de sécurité a entendu, cet après-midi, un exposé de la Sous-Secrétaire générale du Département des opérations de maintien de la paix, Mme Bintou Keita, qui a proposé des mesures visant à combler les lacunes existantes en matière de constitution des forces et de capacités. 

La Sous-secrétaire générale et les membres du Conseil ont été invités, par le Président en exercice du Conseil, le Japon, à mettre l’accent sur la formation et le renforcement des capacités. 

« L’année 2018 doit être celle de la traduction en mesures concrètes des discussions tenues en 2017 sur les opérations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies », écrit le représentant japonais, M. Koro Bessho dans la note de cadrage associée à cette réunion.  « Elle coïncide également avec les discussions approfondies qui doivent avoir lieu sur les réformes du Secrétaire général », fait-il remarquer. 

Mme Keita a salué les actions menées dans ce sens par les membres du Conseil, rappelant qu’à la dernière réunion des ministres de la défense qui s’est tenue le mois dernier à Vancouver, au Canada, 49 annonces ont été faites, en plus de 20 annonces portant sur de nouvelles formations et sessions de renforcement des capacités. 

Elle a indiqué que le Département des opérations de maintien de la paix et le Département de l’appui aux missions entendaient continuer à fournir des conseils et un soutien technique pour assister les États Membres dans le choix des sites et des méthodes de formation. 

Pour s’adapter aux nouvelles réalités et menaces, a expliqué la Sous-Secrétaire générale, les modes d’opérations des missions doivent être continuellement évalués, tout en procédant à des ajustements conséquents des troupes et des plans d’opérations.  À cette fin, a-t-elle dit, les pays contributeurs de troupes doivent faire preuve de flexibilité. 

Mais les capacités des opérations de maintien de la paix ne doivent pas seulement se lire à l’aune du type d’équipements ou du nombre de personnels; elles doivent aussi tenir compte de la capacité à fonctionner avec efficacité.  En outre, a plaidé Mme Keita, les projets de « partenariats triangulaires » impliquant le Conseil, le Secrétariat et les pays contributeurs doivent être étendus à d’autres régions et aux pays francophones, ceci afin de renforcer davantage les capacités des missions.

Plusieurs pays se sont retrouvés dans ses analyses, notamment sur la question des lacunes à combler.  Ainsi, de l’avis de la France, il convient d’adopter une « une approche ambitieuse et innovante », comme le fait d’ailleurs le Département des opérations de maintien de la paix, avec la création « historique » du système de préparation des moyens de maintien de la paix.  À ces efforts devraient s’ajouter ceux du Conseil de sécurité lui-même. 

Dans cette optique, l’Ukraine préconise que le Conseil s’assure que chaque opération dispose des forces dont elle a besoin pour remplir le mandat qu’il lui a confié.  Pour sa part, l’Uruguay pense que la disponibilité de personnels militaires et civils suffisamment équipés et formés est un élément clef pour le succès des mandats.  À cette fin, le Kazakhstan s’est dit partisan d’un examen global annuel de la réforme des opérations de maintien de la paix, tel que préconisé par la résolution 2378 (2017), adoptée le 20 septembre dernier.

Les délégations ont également partagé les vues de Mme Keita quant à la nécessité d’une coopération tripartite.  Selon l’Égypte, ce mécanisme peut contribuer à la réalisation de l’objectif d’élaboration et de renouvellement des mandats.  Il peut aussi aider à la mise en place de mandats séquentiels et éviter des prorogations.  Il permet enfin au Conseil d’avoir une « vision globale des choses ».  Mais étant donné que la majorité des opérations de maintien de la paix se trouvent en Afrique, la Chine a estimé que cette coopération tripartite devait inclure les pays africains et tenir compte de leurs points de vue.

À cet égard, le Sénégal a regretté que « l’on peine toujours à atteindre le plafond des troupes de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA) ».  De façon générale, il a recommandé « une mutualisation des efforts nationaux à travers des coalitions ad hoc entre États et/ou acteurs régionaux ». 

« Sur le seul continent africain, la France participe à la formation de 29 000 militaires africains par an, répartis dans 11 pays et portant sur 57 thématiques différentes », a précisé la représentante de ce pays.  Vantant le rôle du Centre de Brindisi, l’Italie, à son tour, a jugé essentiel de former suffisamment le personnel pour mieux défendre la crédibilité et l’intégrité des opérations de maintien de la paix et des Nations Unies. 

La Fédération de Russie a été d’avis qu’un certain nombre de questions soulevées dans le rapport du Secrétaire général établi en application de la résolution 2378 (2017) doivent être discutées au sein du Comité spécial des opérations de maintien de la paix (Comité des 34).  Comme d’autres pays contributeurs de troupes, elle a été est favorable à une participation accrue des femmes à ces opérations.  À ce titre, 23% des forces de police russes sont présentes dans les 10 opérations de maintien de la paix auxquelles participe le pays. 

S’ils « comptent rester le plus grand contributeur », tant en termes de fourniture de personnels que d’efforts de renforcement des capacités, les États-Unis ont considéré que « cet investissement nécessite de véritables résultats ». 

OPÉRATIONS DE MAINTIEN DE LA PAIX DES NATIONS UNIES

Lettre datée du 18 décembre 2017, adressée au Secrétaire général par le Représentant permanent du Japon auprès de l’Organisation des Nations Unies (S/2017/1077)

Déclarations

Mme BINTOU KEITA, Sous-Secrétaire générale aux opérations de maintien de la paix, a souligné que les missions de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies doivent avoir les capacités appropriées, fournies en temps voulu afin de faire face aux défis de notre temps et ceux à venir.  Nous devons continuer de faire des efforts pour assurer une variété de contributeurs offrant les capacités requises, a-t-elle déclaré, précisant néanmoins que l’ONU restait dépendante des capacités que les États Membres voulaient bien lui offrir.  Les organisations régionales et sous-régionales, y compris l’Union africaine et l’Union européenne, peuvent aussi jouer un rôle pour combler les lacunes, notamment au moment de la mise sur pied des missions et quand celles-ci connaissent des pics de tensions. 

Mme Keita a relevé que le Conseil de sécurité a un rôle crucial à jouer dans la définition des capacités des missions et pour combler leurs lacunes actuelles et futures, y compris par le biais de l’assistance à la formation et au renforcement de capacités.  Elle a salué les actions des membres du Conseil dans cette optique, rappelant qu’à la dernière réunion des ministres de la défense de Vancouver le mois dernier, 49 annonces ont été faites, en plus de 20 annonces portant sur de nouvelles formations et sessions de renforcement de capacités.  Elle a promis que le Département des opérations de maintien de la paix et le Département de l’appui aux missions entendaient continuer de fournir des conseils et un soutien technique pour assister les États Membres dans le choix des sites et des méthodes de formation.  À cet égard, elle a encouragé les États Membres à s’assurer que leurs formations soient focalisées sur le moyen et long terme.

Pour s’adapter aux nouvelles réalités et menaces, a expliqué la Sous-Secrétaire générale, les modes d’opérations des missions vont être continuellement évalués, tandis qu’il sera procédé à des ajustements conséquents des troupes et des plans d’opérations.  Pour cela, les pays contributeurs de troupes doivent faire preuve de flexibilité.  Elle a précisé que les capacités des opérations de maintien de la paix ne doivent pas seulement se lire en matière de type d’équipements ou de nombre de personnels, mais elles doivent aussi tenir compte de la capacité à fonctionner avec efficacité, en fonction de l’agilité, la formation, les équipements, la technologie, la doctrine, le leadership, la discipline, l’interopérabilité, le bien-être et l’état d’esprit, tout comme l’équilibre entre les sexes et l’absence de réserves. 

Dans ce cadre de renforcement de capacités, les formations cruciales comme les programmes de formation électronique sur la prévention des atteintes et de l’exploitation sexuelles doivent désormais être offertes par les États Membres et être obligatoires avant le déploiement des troupes et du personnel civil.  De même, les équipements ne peuvent être utilisés sans un système approprié de maintenance, de réparation et d’acquisition de pièces de rechange.  C’est pourquoi, les États Membres doivent également investir dans des initiatives de formation durable, tout comme ils doivent parier sur des équipements meilleurs afin de préserver les standards onusiens. 

Mme Keita a expliqué que des partenariats ciblés entre États pourraient par exemple permettre de combler les lacunes des missions.  Les choses vont évoluer à partir des leçons apprises de la conférence de constitution des forces de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA).  En outre, les projets de partenariats triangulaires doivent être étendus à d’autres régions et aux pays francophones, ceci afin de renforcer davantage les capacités des missions.

De nombreux progrès ont été faits au cours des dernières années, mais il reste beaucoup à faire, a reconnu Mme Keita en évoquant la mise en place d’un mécanisme léger de coordination entre les entités du Secrétariat impliquées dans les formations, le renforcement de capacités et la mise sur pied des forces, et les États Membres, afin de permettre aux pays voulant donner des contributions de le faire.  Cette coordination vise à mieux diriger les ressources vers les pays contributeurs de contingents ou vers les missions. 

Un mécanisme plus flexible et efficace est aussi requis afin de soutenir une variété d’initiatives et donner des réponses à des besoins parfois imprévus au cours des formations.  Parmi ces nouveautés, l’intervenante a parlé d’une subvention spéciale regroupant plusieurs donateurs, dans le cadre du fonds d’affectation spéciale du Département des opérations de maintien de la paix, afin d’augmenter les ressources existantes, et de coordonner et fournir des formations additionnelles aux pays contributeurs de contingents.  Elle a enfin invité le Conseil de sécurité à s’assurer que les ressources arrêtées correspondent aux mandats des missions de maintien de la paix.

M. FODÉ SECK (Sénégal) a relevé le rôle important que joue le Groupe de travail sur les opérations de maintien de la paix, présidé par son pays ces deux dernières années.  S’agissant des efforts visant à réduire les lacunes des opérations de maintien de la paix, il s’est félicité des innovations réalisées avec la création de la cellule stratégique de génération de forces et de planification des capacités. 

En outre, le représentant a estimé que les travaux en cours dans le cadre du partenariat avec les organismes régionaux, particulièrement l’Union africaine, permettront de renforcer les capacités opérationnelles des unités africaines appelées à exécuter les missions dans le cadre de l’emploi de la force.  Il a cité la brigade intérimaire de la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo (MONUSCO), la force de protection régionale de la Mission des Nations Unies au Soudan du Sud (MINUSS) et la force de la Mission d’observation militaire de l’Union africaine en Somalie (AMISOM).

M. Seck a salué les engagements souscrits par plusieurs pays contributeurs de troupes et de police lors du Sommet des dirigeants de septembre 2015 et des rencontres ministérielles de Londres, Paris et Vancouver.  Toutefois, a-t-il constaté, beaucoup reste encore à faire.  Ainsi, a-t-il regretté, « l’on peine toujours à atteindre le plafond des troupes de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA) ».  De façon générale, le représentant a recommandé « une mutualisation des efforts nationaux à travers des coalitions ad hoc entre États et/ou acteurs régionaux ».  

Mme ANNE GUEGUEN (France) a déclaré partager le diagnostic du Secrétariat et ses efforts pour développer « une approche ambitieuse et innovante de la génération de forces », compte tenu des lacunes clairement identifiées ces dernières années, notamment en termes de capacités aériennes, de soutien médical, d’équipements, de formations prédéploiement.  Face aux contraintes existantes, l’innovation est le meilleur moyen de répondre à ces défis, a poursuivi la représentante, avant de se féliciter de la création « historique » du système de préparation des moyens de maintien de la paix au sein du Département des opérations de maintien de la paix.  Son renforcement doit se poursuivre, notamment en favorisant une meilleure utilisation de ses niveaux 2 et 3.  En parallèle, l’augmentation du nombre de pays accédant au niveau 1 doit faire l’objet d’un effort permanent, fruit de l’interaction avec les pays contributeurs de troupes, a-t-elle dit. 

Mme Gueguen s’est également réjouie du développement de nouveaux mécanismes de génération de forces, comme l’a montré l’étape majeure franchie avec la conférence de génération de forces de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA), tenue en mai dernier.  Selon elle, l’application de ce modèle à d’autres opérations de maintien de la paix et à d’autres capacités spécialisées doit se poursuivre pour « coller au mieux » les ressources aux besoins.  Elle a partagé le même sentiment en ce qui concerne le développement des engagements conjoints et des « promesses intelligentes », qui permettent de mettre à disposition des capacités critiques et d’élargir le spectre des formations nécessaires à l’acquisition de nouveaux savoir-faire liés à l’environnement asymétrique, comme la protection contre les engins explosifs improvisés.

La représentante a ensuite assuré que son pays, à travers sa coopération bilatérale et de sécurité de défense, contribue à la formation et à l’équipement de nombreux contingents appelés à être déployés.  « Sur le seul continent africain, la France participe à la formation de 29 000 militaires africains par an, répartis dans 11 pays et portant sur 57 thématiques différentes. »  Elle travaille aussi avec de nombreux pays contributeurs de troupes pour favoriser le développement des capacités de maintien de la paix.  Cependant, la France estime que la formation des contingents relève avant tout de l’État concerné, même si elle pense en même temps qu’il revient aux États Membres d’assurer le plus haut niveau de conduite et de discipline, afin d’assurer le respect des principes onusiens, notamment dans la lutte contre l’exploitation sexuelle, a conclu sa représentante.

Mme MICHELE J. SISON (États-Unis) a estimé que, comme beaucoup de questions liées au maintien de la paix, la constitution des forces est un enjeu nécessitant des résultats concrets.  Les États-Unis, a-t-elle souligné, ont investi 1,3 milliard de dollars dans le cadre de l’initiative de renforcement des capacités pour le maintien de la paix.  À cet égard, a poursuivi la déléguée, « si les États-Unis comptent rester le plus grand contributeur, tant en termes de fourniture de personnels que d’efforts de renforcement des capacités, ils considèrent que cet investissement nécessite de véritables résultats ».

Pour cela, nous avons besoin de partenariats étroits pour renforcer les capacités et nous acquitter efficacement de nos opérations, a-t-elle plaidé, déplorant que les lacunes en matière de formation et d’équipement hypothèquent trop souvent encore le succès des opérations.  Nous avons également besoin d’un processus de prise de décisions plus objectif, a insisté la représentante.  Selon elle, « il importe que l’ONU sache où les besoins sont les plus importants et où les lacunes sont les plus criantes ».

Saluant le travail accompli par l’Unité de constitution des forces et de renforcement des capacités, elle a assuré que ce processus de rationalisation ne visait pas à sanctionner les États qui fournissent des troupes mais à combiner les meilleures capacités pour renforcer le taux de réussite des opérations.  Elle a enfin affirmé que l’appui constituait un volet essentiel de l’amélioration des capacités, appelant à cette fin à l’intensification de la coopération entre le Conseil, le Secrétariat et les pays fournisseurs de contingents.

M. CHENG LIE (Chine) a déclaré que, pour accroître l’efficacité des opérations de maintien de la paix, la communauté internationale doit, non seulement prêter une attention aux pays africains, aux pays contributeurs de troupes, mais aussi assurer la disponibilité des ressources et des matériels.

Il est également nécessaire d’assurer une formation aux personnels et travailler en coopération avec l’Union africaine.  Ces mesures, en plus d’une bonne préparation, d’une formation et protection des personnels déployés sur le terrain, sont les garanties du succès des opérations de maintien de la paix, a assuré le représentant, ajoutant que cette mission revenait au Secrétariat.

Il a également affirmé qu’en tant que pays fournisseur de contingents, la Chine est engagée à assumer ses responsabilités à tous les plans.  La Chine a, par exemple, déjà assuré la formation de 800 Casques bleus en Afrique, en plus d’avoir investi 100 millions de dollars dans la coopération militaire avec l’Union africaine. 

Par ailleurs, les contingents chinois sont d’ores et déjà enregistrés au mécanisme de préparation des forces des Nations Unies.  Ils sont rapidement disponibles et déployables, a affirmé le représentant en conclusion.   

Mme IRINA SCHOULGIN NYONI (Suède) a salué les recommandations du Secrétaire général en vue de combler les lacunes capacitaires des opérations de l’ONU, notamment par une formation efficace des troupes.  Il est crucial que les pays contributeurs se montrent à la hauteur de leur responsabilité dans l’équipement et la formation de leurs troupes en vue d’une bonne exécution des mandats, a-t-elle poursuivi.  Elle a détaillé l’appui fourni par la Suède aux pays contributeurs, notamment à un bataillon d’infanterie de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA), avant de souhaiter une augmentation du nombre de pays contributeurs.

En vue d’une meilleure efficacité de ces opérations, la déléguée suédoise a souhaité que le Secrétariat fournisse des avis stratégiques « francs et honnêtes », articulés autour d’objectifs clairs et opérationnels.  Enfin, elle a souligné l’importance de combattre les atteintes et l’exploitation sexuelles et approuvé les initiatives du Secrétaire général visant à augmenter le nombre de femmes dans les rangs des opérations de paix.

Tout le monde sait que l’ONU ne dispose pas d’une armée propre et dépend des contributions des autres États pour fournir des troupes aux opérations de maintien de la paix, a rappelé M. DAWIT YIRGA WOLDEGERIMA (Éthiopie).  Or, a-t-il dit, la lente mobilisation des troupes par les États et les autres défis identifiés dans le rapport ont des conséquences sur l’efficacité des opérations de maintien de la paix.  À cet égard, il a espéré que les recommandations contenues dans le rapport du Secrétaire général permettront de faire des progrès.  Mais tout le monde sait aussi que ces recommandations ne suffiront pas, a-t-il poursuivi, ajoutant que seule une volonté politique est à même de faire faire des progrès. 

L’Éthiopie est en faveur d’une coopération triangulaire entre le Conseil de sécurité, le Secrétariat et les pays contributeurs de troupes, a déclaré M. Woldegerima.  Il a salué le mécanisme de coordination proposé par le Secrétaire général dans son rapport, qui devrait permettre d’établir une plateforme pour la coopération et la formation des troupes.  Mais ces efforts doivent aller de pair avec la réalisation des engagements pris, notamment lors de la Conférence de Vancouver, a aussi estimé le représentant, avant de plaider pour le renforcement des capacités des troupes de l’Union africaine, dont l’efficacité et la rapidité de déploiement ont été prouvées, selon lui.  

M. PEDRO LUIS INCHAUSTE JORDÁN (Bolivie) a jugé nécessaire d’opérer des changements structurels pour que les opérations de maintien de la paix s’adaptent aux nouvelles menaces asymétriques posées par les groupes terroristes et la criminalité transnationale organisée.  À cet égard, a-t-il dit, les mandats conçus par le Conseil de sécurité doivent reposer sur une analyse technique, logistique, mais avant tout politique, et ils doivent être plus réalistes et précis et mieux ciblés.  Il a vanté les Principes de Vancouver en ce qui concerne la protection des mineurs et la participation des femmes aux opérations de maintien de la paix. 

L’équipement et la formation des troupes relèvent autant de la responsabilité des pays contributeurs que de celle de l’ONU en général, a souligné le représentant.  Les attaques constantes dont sont victimes les membres des forces de paix montrent combien il est important de renforcer la connaissance du terrain, la capacité de réaction des unités et la protection des camps et des effectifs.  M. Inchauste Jordán a rappelé que le succès des opérations de maintien de la paix dépend aussi de l’appui du pays hôte, tandis que les mandats doivent respecter la souveraineté, l’indépendance et l’intégrité territoriale des États.

M. ELBIO OSCAR ROSSELLI FRIERI (Uruguay) a reconnu que 2017 avait été une année intense en termes de débats sur le futur des opérations de maintien de la paix tant au Conseil de sécurité, à l’Assemblée générale, à la Quatrième Commission, qu’au Comité spécial des opérations de maintien de la paix (Comité des 34).  Par ailleurs, une récente réunion des ministres de la défense, organisée avec l’Uruguay, s’est tenue à Vancouver sur ce sujet, avec « des résultats qui permettent d’être optimiste ».  À cela s’ajoute le débat de haut niveau organisé sous la présidence éthiopienne du Conseil de sécurité et qui a abouti à l’adoption, à l’unanimité, de la résolution 2378 (2017) qui souligne, entre autres, la nécessité de continuer de travailler ensemble, notamment pour combler les lacunes observées dans les opérations de maintien de la paix.

En effet, l’Uruguay considère le renforcement des forces stratégiques comme une composante essentielle de l’efficacité de ces opérations.  La disponibilité de personnels militaires et civils suffisamment équipés et formés est un élément clef pour la bonne et pleine mise en œuvre de leurs mandats.  Le représentant a estimé aussi que le Conseil de sécurité peut contribuer de façon significative à ces objectifs, notamment lors des étapes d’analyse, de création, de planification ou de reconfiguration d’une opération.  À ce titre, il a jugé « fondamentale » une coopération triangulaire entre le Conseil, le Secrétariat et les pays contributeurs de troupes et de police.

En tant que pays contributeur de troupes, l’Uruguay déplore le nombre croissant d’attaques contre les installations et les personnels des Nations Unies comme on l’a vu en République centrafricaine ou en République démocratique du Congo.  Tous ceux qui s’attaquent aux personnels des Nations Unies doivent être punis et traduits en justice, a fait valoir M. Rosselli Frieri, ajoutant que « ne pas regarder la vérité en face n’est pas le meilleur moyen de répondre aux défis actuels ».  

M. YURIY VITRENKO (Ukraine) a constaté qu’en dépit des efforts consentis par la communauté internationale en matière de maintien de la paix, le monde ne devient pas plus sûr.  Au contraire, les guerres et les agressions se multiplient.  Il a donc estimé essentiel de garantir à chaque opération de maintien de la paix la force dont elle a besoin pour remplir le mandat que lui a confié le Conseil.  Aux yeux de l’Ukraine, cette tâche fait partie intégrante de la réforme globale recommandée par le Groupe indépendant de haut niveau chargé d’étudier les opérations de paix.

Observant que, ces dernières années, le maintien de la paix s’est adapté en termes d’équipement et d’expertise à l’exécution des mandats, le délégué s’est félicité que l’on ait gagné en souplesse et en prévisibilité.  Il a cependant estimé que des progrès restent à réaliser en matière d’exécution, notamment au regard de situations changeant rapidement sur le terrain.  À cette fin, il faut continuer à améliorer le dialogue entre les pays fournisseurs de contingents, le Conseil de sécurité et le Secrétariat.  Il a aussi souhaité que les missions se voient confier des mandats clairs, cohérents et réalisables, avec pour objectif de soutenir une solution politique au conflit.  À cet égard, a-t-il relevé, l’impartialité doit être un principe directeur pour les missions et leur personnel.

Le représentant a également estimé que le Conseil, tout en décidant de la création ou du renouvellement de mandats, devrait soutenir davantage le Secrétariat pour que les opérations de maintien de la paix bénéficient des technologies modernes appropriées.  Il a appelé la communauté internationale à fournir aux personnels engagés dans ces opérations une formation et un équipement adaptés à l’exécution de leur mandat.  Sur ce point, a-t-il conclu, il importe que le Conseil suive attentivement la mise en œuvre de la résolution 2272 et soutienne les efforts du Secrétaire général en vue d’éliminer les violences sexuelles dans le cadre des opérations de maintien de la paix.   

M. DOVGANYUK (Kazakhstan) a observé que les opérations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies sont aujourd’hui confrontées aux incidences de menaces asymétriques et violentes qui nécessitent un plan systématique de réduction de ces risques consistant à adapter les approches existantes ou à créer de nouvelles stratégies.  Dans ce contexte, a-t-il dit, le Kazakhstan est favorable à un examen global annuel de la réforme des opérations de maintien de la paix, tel que préconisé par la résolution 2378.  Il souhaite également que soient renforcés les critères de sélection et de formation des personnels de maintien de la paix ainsi que leur entraînement sur le terrain, particulièrement dans les situations à fort risque d’attaques armées et terroristes.

Le représentant s’est d’autre part prononcé en faveur d’une amélioration des stratégies afin de réagir aux menaces de groupes et de milices ciblant délibérément les troupes de maintien de la paix, les civils et les acteurs humanitaires.  Il a aussi estimé que les Casques bleus devraient se centrer davantage sur la protection des civils, compte tenu des importants déplacements de populations.

Le représentant a en outre appelé à l’établissement d’un dialogue étroit et à la poursuite des consultations entre le Conseil de sécurité, le Secrétariat et les pays fournisseurs de contingents ou de personnels de police.  À ses yeux, accroître le nombre de pays contributeurs augmenterait la crédibilité des opérations de maintien de la paix dans les zones concernées. 

M. IHAB MOUSTAFA AWAD (Égypte) a noté que la réforme des opérations de maintien de la paix ainsi que les examens de ces dernières années se sont concentrés sur les aspects opérationnels et techniques des opérations.  Il s’est agi d’élargir la base des pays fournisseurs et d’améliorer les processus de constitution des forces, ces questions étant débattues lors de conférences internationales, dont la dernière s’est tenue à Vancouver.  Toutefois, a commenté le délégué, « il est temps que ces efforts se concrétisent sur le terrain ».  À cet égard, a-t-il précisé, l’Égypte considère que le renforcement des capacités et la constitution de forces vont de pair avec le processus tripartite de consultations entre le Conseil de sécurité, le Secrétariat et les pays fournisseurs de contingents.  Ce mécanisme, a-t-il dit, peut contribuer à la réalisation de l’objectif d’élaboration et de renouvellement des mandats.  Il peut aussi aider à la mise en place de mandats séquentiels et éviter des prorogations sans prévoir de date butoir ou de sortie.  Il permet enfin au Conseil d’avoir une vision globale des choses.

En deuxième lieu, l’Égypte considère que la réforme des opérations de maintien de la paix doit prévoir des efforts en matière de formation et une amélioration de la chaîne de commandement et de contrôle.  Il faut aussi permettre aux forces sur le terrain de prendre des décisions, a souligné le représentant, ajoutant que l’augmentation du nombre de pays contributeurs ne doit pas se faire aux dépens des bonnes performances et du respect des normes en vigueur, notamment en ce qui concerne les abus sexuels. 

Évoquant d’autre part l’augmentation, ce dernier mois, de la fréquence des attaques contre des unités en charge du maintien de la paix, M. Awad a estimé que ces incidents avaient mis en relief les lacunes des opérations, tant pour ce qui est de la formation que de la nature des équipements ou de l’évaluation des risques.  Nous avons besoin de les combler urgemment afin de renforcer la crédibilité de ces opérations et protéger la vie de nos personnels, a-t-il plaidé.  La performance des opérations, a conclu le représentant, doit être évaluée « à l’aune de leur capacité à contribuer à la recherche d’une solution politique ».

M. PETR V. ILIICHEV (Fédération de Russie) a déclaré que le processus de réforme dans lequel sont engagées les Nations Unies doit aboutir à une meilleure efficacité des opérations de maintien de la paix.  Mais bien que le rapport du Secrétaire général ait été publié avec retard et que les capitales ne s’en soient pas encore pleinement saisies, il a constaté avec satisfaction que l’on y évoque la question d’une coopération triangulaire entre le Conseil de sécurité, le Secrétariat et les pays contributeurs de troupes.  Il a noté aussi que le rapport traite de la formation linguistique des Casques bleus, dans le contexte où 48% d’entre eux travaillent dans le monde francophone.  Sans dire si cette question relève d’une priorité ou non, la délégation russe estime qu’il faut en discuter avec les fournisseurs de troupes.

M. Iliichev a également été d’avis qu’un certain nombre de questions soulevées dans le rapport doivent être discutées au sein du Comité spécial des opérations de maintien de la paix (Comité des 34).  En tant que contributeur de troupes, la Fédération de Russie est favorable à une participation accrue des femmes à ces opérations.  À ce titre, 23% des forces de police russes présentes dans les 10 opérations de maintien de la paix auxquelles participe le pays sont des femmes, a précisé le représentant. 

En ce qui concerne la formation, l’un des autres thèmes abordés dans le rapport, le représentant a indiqué que son pays dispose d’un centre de formation spécialisé pour les Casques bleus russes et non russes, y compris des formations linguistiques.  La Fédération de Russie est en outre disposée à mettre à disposition son académie de formation militaire, a assuré le représentant.   

M. JONATHAN GUY ALLEN (Royaume-Uni) a souligné le rôle essentiel que jouent les opérations de maintien de la paix pour endiguer et réduire les conflits, comme c’est aujourd’hui le cas au Mali et au Soudan du Sud.  Selon le représentant, les exemples sont nombreux de succès mais aussi de sacrifices de Casques bleus, les dernières pertes onusiennes remontant au mois dernier.  Au-delà des questions de renforcement des capacités et d’équipement des forces, il importe d’en faire davantage pour mieux protéger les civils pris au piège des conflits, a souligné le représentant, appelant à une progression des investissements dans le processus de constitution des forces.

Rappelant les précédentes propositions britanniques au Conseil de sécurité lors des débats sur cette question, notamment en matière d’innovation et de planification, le représentant a rappelé que son pays avait formé plus de 11 000 Casques bleus sur différentes missions.  Nous leur avons fourni une formation au leadership mais aussi à la prévention des abus sexuels, a-t-il précisé, évoquant à cet égard une initiative impliquant le Royaume-Uni, le Canada et le Bangladesh et destinée à informer les contingents sur les relations hommes-femmes.

M. Allen a encore indiqué que son pays avait déployé 700 membres de ses propres forces sur huit théâtres d’opérations.  C’est ainsi que, par le biais de son déploiement auprès de la Mission des Nations Unies au Soudan du Sud (MINUSS), le Royaume-Uni travaille avec le Viet Nam et l’Australie à la construction d’un hôpital de campagne pour les Casques bleus.  Il a enfin préconisé un meilleur ciblage pour l’utilisation des ressources limitées de l’ONU.  Pour cela, nous devons nouer plus de partenariats, notamment pour aider les pays qui ont besoin d’experts techniques, a-t-il avancé, souhaitant enfin que tout soit fait pour améliorer les dispositifs d’appui.  « Nous le devons à ces hommes et ces femmes qui effectuent des missions de maintien de la paix au péril de leur vie », a-t-il conclu.

M. INIGO LAMBERTINI (Italie) a déclaré que son pays, dans sa région, est l’un des plus importants contributeurs de troupes et d’observateurs internationaux, avec plus de 1 000 personnels déployés dans diverses opérations de maintien de la paix de l’ONU.  L’Italie est aussi d’avis que l’utilisation des nouvelles technologies dans ces opérations peut être un plus, comme le montre l’utilisation de drones par la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo (MONUSCO) pour la collecte d’informations. 

En matière de formation des personnels, le représentant a jugé « essentiel » de les former suffisamment pour mieux défendre la crédibilité et l’intégrité des opérations de maintien de la paix et des Nations Unies.  À cet égard, il a vanté le rôle du centre de Brindisi.

M. KORO BESSHO (Japon) a déclaré que la formation et le renforcement des capacités sont des outils importants pour combler les lacunes constatées dans les opérations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies, notamment en matière de constitution des forces et de capacités.  Dans ce contexte, il est essentiel de mettre en relation les pays fournisseurs de contingents ou de personnel de police et les pays donateurs.  Outre le Secrétariat, les missions de maintien de la paix ont un rôle à jouer pour lier la formation, le renforcement des capacités et les déploiements.

De même, a poursuivi le Président en exercice du Conseil, les efforts de réforme des Nations Unies doivent déboucher sur une meilleure relation de travail entre New York et les missions.  Les mesures visant à combler les lacunes existantes requièrent des efforts collectifs de la part des États Membres, dont les contributions et l’assistance sont vitales.  Pour sa part, a-t-il assuré, le Japon est disposé à renforcer son rôle dans la région de l’Asie et du Pacifique et en Afrique.

 Environ 17 330 personnes déplacés en octobre et novembre, à cause de l’insécurité à Pweto

 US$ 70 000 nécessaires pour prendre en charge les enfants non Accompagnés à Pweto 

**Aperçu de la situation**

Entre les mois d’octobre et novembre, environ 17 330 personnes se sont déplacées, fuyant les violences dans le Territoire de Pweto (Province du Haut-Katanga) et des milliers d’autres continuent à se réfugier en Zambie. Sur les 66 villages répartis sur les axes Mushima – Mwenge, Pweto – Kizabi et Pweto – Kipeto, la moitié est actuellement vide, à cause des attaques de la milice Twa, depuis mi-octobre et d’autres exactions commises par l’armée congolaise. 

Sur l’axe Kamakanga-Mutabi-Kampangwe (Chefferie de Kyona Nzini), les violences dues au conflit communautaire qui opposait, depuis février, les communautés Twa au Zela, a baissé d’un cran depuis le mois de septembre. Cette accalmie a favorisé le retour de plus de 12 000 personnes qui avaient fui, entre juillet et octobre 2017, dans leurs villages d’origine. Les interventions humanitaires du mécanisme de Réponse Rapide aux Mouvements de Populations (RRMP), dans les domaines de la santé, de l’eau, de l’éducation et des articles ménagers essentiels ont aussi contribué à ce processus de retour. 

Les humanitaires s’attendent à ce que le nombre des déplacés augmente, car plusieurs autres familles déplacées auraient trouvé refuge dans des endroits jusque-là inaccessibles à cause de l’insécurité et du mauvais état des routes. 

**Besoins et Réponses humanitaires** 

**Protection**

Le Fonds des Nations Unies pour l’Enfance (Unicef), finance, depuis deux mois, les activités de prise en charge d’une centaine d’enfants non accompagnés, dans la cité de Pweto. Il s’agit de la prise en charge médicale, du support dans les familles d’accueil et de la réunification familiale. En collaboration avec son partenaire l’ONG APEDE, UNICEF assure aussi les soins médicaux pour 30 enfants blessés suite aux violences à Pweto. Jusque-là, les acteurs de protection de l’enfance ont répertorié 347 enfants répartis dans les villages Kansabala, Kasama, Kipeto, Lukonzolwa, Mutabi et Mwenge. Des recherches continuent pour identifier d’autres enfants parmi les personnes déplacées internes qui ont été séparés de leurs familles et communautés, à cause des conflits et violences armés. Le projet prend fin d’ici la fin de décembre 2017, mais les experts pensent que ces chiffres risquent d’augmenter dans les prochains jours, car l’insécurité est loin de s’améliorer à Pweto et de nombreux enfants affectés par ces conflits sont sans assistance. 

70 000 dollars américains sont encore nécessaires pour continuer la prise en charge des enfants identifiés non accompagnés. Selon UNICEF, un « enfant non accompagné est enfant qui a été séparé de ses deux parents et d’autres membres proches de sa famille et n’est pas pris en charge par un adulte investi de cette responsabilité par la loi ou la coutume ».  

D’après ces experts, environ 19 500 autres enfants se trouvant dans le Territoire de Pweto ont été également affectés par ces violences et leurs conditions nécessiteraient un accompagnement psychosocial. Mais, les fonds manquent pour mettre en place les « Espaces Amis d’Enfants » pour des enfants entre 5 et 17 ans affectés par les conflits. Ces espaces accueilleront des enfants vulnérables affectés par le conflit et leur offriront un endroit où ils pourront jouer, apprendre, tout en recevant un support psycho social adapté à leurs besoins. Ces espaces pourront aussi ne servir de points de départ pour d’autres activités, comme le rattrapage scolaire, l’identification des besoins en nutrition, les vaccinations.",268,"French"
2387689,"Bulletin humanitaire Niger, octobre-novembre 2017 **FAITS SAILLANTS**

- Le nombre de personnes dans le besoin est passé de 1,9 million en 2017 à 2,3 millions en 2018.

- Près de 6 000 personnes dans la région de Diffa passent en phase de crise, selon les résultats du cadre harmonisé d’analyse de la vulnérabilité alimentaire.

- Une moyenne hebdomadaire de 6 000 migrants sortants enregistrée en 2016 contre une moyenne mensuelle de 5 500 migrants sortants en 2017.

- Près d’une trentaine d’écoles toujours fermées dans la région de Diffa où l’insécurité reste une menace

**2,3 millions de personnes auront besoin d’assistance en 2018** 

La situation humanitaire au Niger reste préoccupante du fait d’une crise marquée par la combinaison de vulnérabilités tant chroniques qu’aiguës. Les déplacements prolongés de populations dans la région de Diffa liés à la crise sécuritaire dans le bassin du Lac Tchad et l’insécurité grandissante aux frontières avec le Mali contribuent à la dégradation des conditions de vie des personnes vulnérables affectées par la pauvreté, la malnutrition, l’insécurité alimentaire et le faible accès aux services sociaux de base.  
L’analyse des besoins des clusters révèle qu’en 2018, près de 2,3 millions de personnes auront besoin d’assistance dans le pays. Ce chiffre est en augmentation de 400 000 personnes par rapport à janvier 2017 en raison notamment d’une hausse de la population dans le besoin dans tous les secteurs, à l’exception de celui des abris et des biens non alimentaires.

Le secteur de la nutrition enregistre une progression importante avec plus d’1,7 million de personnes dans le besoin, soit 250 000 personnes de plus qu’en 2017, pouvant s’expliquer par la prise en compte d’un facteur d’accroissement de la population dans les estimations. Par ailleurs, le nombre de personnes ayant des besoins dans le secteur de la protection a presque triplé, augmentation se justifiant par l’intégration des besoins en protection dans tout le pays à la différence de 2017 où seuls les besoins identifiés dans la région de Diffa étaient considérés.  

Des besoins humanitaires plus critiques dans les régions de Diffa et Maradi L’analyse de la sévérité des besoins révèle une situation humanitaire modérée à critique dans près de la moitié des départements du pays, soit 30 départements sur 64.  

Le plus grand nombre de personnes ayant besoin d’assistance humanitaire se trouve dans la région de Maradi où près de 452 230 personnes sont dans une situation critique (soit 10 pour cent de la population régionale). Cependant, c’est à Diffa que l’on trouve la proportion de la population la plus vulnérable avec environ 50 pour cent des habitants (soit plus de 419 405 personnes) dans une situation de vulnérabilité critique.  

En outre, la région de Diffa compte le plus grand nombre de personnes nécessitant une assistance dans les secteurs de la santé, de la sécurité alimentaire, de la protection, des abris et des biens non alimentaires (BNA) et de l’éducation. La région de Maradi enregistre quant à elle, la prévalence de la malnutrition aiguë la plus élevée tandis que le plus grand nombre de personnes ayant besoin d’assistance en eau, hygiène et assainissement se trouve dans la région de Tillabéry.

2387264,"Cameroun : l’aggravationde la crise anglophone requiert des mesures fortes - Crisis Group Briefing Afrique N°130 **I. Synthèse**

La crise qui dure depuis un an dans les régions du Nord-Ouest et Sud-Ouest du Cameroun a dégénéré le 1er octobre 2017, en marge de la proclamation symbolique d’indépendance de l’Etat d’Ambazonie par des militants sécessionnistes. Les violences ont fait au moins des dizaines de morts et plus de 100 blessés parmi les manifestants. Elles sont le signe d’une forte détérioration de la situation et requièrent une réaction urgente du président camerounais Paul Biya ainsi qu’une réponse ferme des partenaires internationaux.

Les évènements du 1er octobre (date commémorant la réunification en 1961 entre le Cameroun sous mandat français et le Cameroun britannique – Southern Cameroons) sont le point culminant d’une nouvelle phase de durcissement de la crise. Celle-ci est marquée par l’échec des missions officielles du gouvernement à l’étranger en août, qui a abouti à une augmentation du nombre d’incendies criminels et des violences sporadiques de groupuscules non identifiés, à la répression violente par les forces de sécurité des manifestations de militants anglophones le 22 septembre, à l’explosion de bombes artisanales dans le Nord-Ouest et à l’imposition d’un état d’urgence de fait du 29 septembre au 3 octobre.

Du fait de cette répression meurtrière, les rangs des sécessionnistes augmentent de jour en jour, et certains d’entre eux évoquent plus résolument l’idée d’une lutte armée ou l’« autodéfense ». S’il veut éviter la naissance d’une insurrection armée dans les régions anglophones, qui ne manquerait pas d’avoir des répercussions en zone francophone, le président camerounais doit aller au-delà des mesures cosmétiques et prendre ses responsabilités pour trouver des solutions politiques à la crise. Les recommandations détaillées dans le rapport d’août 2017 de Crisis Group demeurent d’actualité, mais la gravité de la situation oblige à agir plus vite. Ces réformes devraient être précédées d’un dialogue inclusif au plus haut niveau afin d’envisager des solutions durables. L’aggravation de la crise qui fait suite à cette répression sanglante requiert désormais l’intervention d’un médiateur crédible, tel que le Bureau régional des Nations unies pour l’Afrique centrale ou l’Union africaine.

Les partenaires internationaux, jusqu’ici passifs, voire complaisants vis-à-vis du régime, devraient condamner fermement la violence d’Etat et la répression meurtrière. Ils devraient également exiger une enquête indépendante et des sanctions à l’encontre des auteurs de ces violences, ainsi que l’ouverture d’un dialogue inclusif sur la décentralisation et le fédéralisme. Enfin, ils devraient clairement souligner que de nouvelles violences de masse des forces de sécurité entraineraient une réévaluation de la coopération militaire avec le Cameroun.",268,"French"
2387244,"Crise anglophone au Cameroun : le dialogue demeure l’unique solution viable *La récente flambée de la violence dans les régions anglophones du Cameroun semble indiquer la naissance d’une insurrection. Le gouvernement doit, pour éradiquer la violence en cette année électorale délicate, mettre en œuvre des mesures politiques qui réduiront le soutien croissant qu’obtiennent les insurgés. Avec l’aide de ses partenaires internationaux, il devrait entamer un dialogue avec les dirigeants anglophones pacifiques afin de discuter des questions de décentralisation et de gouvernance du pays.*

**Une insurrection en gestation**

En août 2017, Crisis Group a tiré la sonnette d’alarme sur le risque d’une insurrection au Cameroun anglophone si un dialogue sincère, accompagné de mesures fortes de décrispation, n’était pas entamé. Malheureusement, la crise en cours depuis un an a franchi un cap en novembre quand elle s’est accompagnée d’attaques armées contre les forces de défense. Depuis lors, au moins seize militaires et policiers ont été tués et une vingtaine blessés, suite à treize attaques menées par des séparatistes. C’est quatre fois le nombre de militaires tués par Boko Haram à l’Extrême-Nord au cours de la même période.

Suite à la répression par les forces de défense et de sécurité des manifestations du 22 septembre et du 1er octobre 2017, le camp séparatiste s’est endurci et gagne en popularité. Le département de la Manyu dans le Sud-Ouest est l’épicentre actuel de l’insurrection, du fait de sa proximité avec l’Etat nigérian de Cross River où résident certains cadres de la « République fédérale d’Ambazonie » (désignation par les séparatistes de leur Etat autoproclamé). La majorité de ces attaques sont de basse intensité, mais quelques-unes paraissent plus importantes. Selon le ministre de la Communication, celle contre la compagnie de gendarmerie de Mamfé le 8 décembre a été menée par 200 assaillants, même si ce nombre semble surévalué.

Le mouvement anglophone ne se réduit pas à son courant sécessionniste, loin de là. Mais au sein de la mouvance sécessionniste, les partisans de la lutte armée semblent désormais prévaloir. Des recrutements de combattants et la présence de camps d’entrainement dans les localités frontalières ont été signalés par les médias officiels camerounais et des sources diplomatiques contactées par Crisis Group. Les participants à la lutte armée sont répartis en deux catégories. La première serait constituée d’une dizaine de groupuscules violents ou groupes d’autodéfense, comptant en moyenne dix à 30 membres chacun : à l’instar des Tigers, Vipers ou Ambaland forces. Certains d’entre eux incendient les marchés, les commerces et les écoles. La seconde comprendrait trois milices rebelles dont le nombre cumulé de combattants est estimé à plus d’une centaine : les Ambazonia Defence Forces (ADF), dirigées par Ayaba Cho Lucas et Benedict Nwana Kuah, les Southern Cameroons Defence Forces (SOCADEF), dirigées par Ebenezer Derek Mbongo Akwanga et le groupe homonyme 
Southern Cameroons Defence Forces (SCDF), dirigé par Nso Foncha Nkem.

Sept bombes artisanales ont explosé depuis le début de la crise dans les régions anglophones, sans faire de victimes, et une autre a été désamorcée à Douala. Il y a lieu de penser qu’il ne s’agissait que de tests dans le but de montrer aux autorités camerounaises leur potentiel de nuisance, y compris en zone francophone, si l’insurrection venait à s’intensifier.

Le « gouvernement intérimaire » de l’Ambazonie rejette pour l’instant l’option de l’insurrection. Mais les partisans de la lutte armée ont multiplié les attaques dans le but de pousser l’Etat camerounais à déclarer la guerre et à mettre ce « gouvernement intérimaire » devant le fait accompli. Sous pression, le président de l’Ambazonie, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, hésite entre lutte armée et poursuite de la désobéissance civile et des initiatives diplomatiques. La pression de sa base pourrait l’amener à changer d’avis en 2018 et à passer de l’autodéfense à l’insurrection effective.

Les violences perpétrées depuis octobre engendrent une situation humanitaire préoccupante. Des milliers d’habitants ont fui vers le Nigéria voisin et des dizaines de milliers vers d’autres départements moins exposés ou dans les régions francophones. L’exode des populations a été aggravé par un communiqué maladroit du préfet de la Manyu qui a demandé, début décembre, aux populations d’une quinzaine de villages de quitter leurs localités, en leur donnant un délai très court, sous peine d’être considérés par les militaires comme des complices des « terroristes ». [Le Haut-commissariat aux réfugiés](https://reliefweb.int/node/2380974/) déclare avoir enregistré 7 204 réfugiés camerounais au Nigéria. Les autorités de l’Etat du Cross River évoquent la présence de plus de 28 000 réfugiés camerounais, la majorité n’étant pas prise en charge.

**Une réponse militaire qui risque de crisper la population**

Face au basculement d’une fraction des séparatistes dans la lutte armée, le président du Cameroun a déclaré la guerre aux sécessionnistes et les a assimilés aux terroristes : des mandats d’arrêt internationaux contre les dirigeants sécessionnistes ont été émis, une énième vague de renforts militaires a été déployée dans le Sud-Ouest et l’état d’urgence a été imposé de fait dans le département de la Manyu. Ces décisions s’accompagnent malheureusement d’un refus de dialoguer sincèrement avec les militants fédéralistes anglophones qui n’ont jamais prôné la violence, et dont certains ont été incarcérés en janvier 2017 pour des motifs politiques.

Il y a un an, le gouvernement camerounais estimait que le problème anglophone n’existait pas. Il y a dix mois, les radicaux du gouvernement estimaient qu’en arrêtant les chefs de file du courant fédéraliste la crise serait réglée ; elle s’est au contraire aggravée. Aujourd’hui ces mêmes radicaux font le pari de la guerre, malgré le cout en vies humaines – à ce jour, une soixantaine de civils, seize militaires et policiers, et un nombre indéterminé de combattants sécessionnistes ont été tués. Ce pari pourrait s’avérer contreproductif, car la riposte militaire ne fera qu’alimenter le cycle de violences, accroitre l’adhésion de la population aux idées séparatistes et renforcer la position des partisans de la lutte armée au sein de la mouvance sécessionniste. Des bavures militaires et des violations graves des droits humains commises par les militaires ont par ailleurs été signalées, notamment par les chefs traditionnels, dans le département de la Manyu.

Le président Biya ne parviendra que difficilement à stabiliser les régions anglophones par la seule riposte militaire, et ce serait au prix d’une guerre contre-insurrectionnelle laborieuse et couteuse. Toutefois, au sein du pouvoir, l’escalade violente des séparatistes fait le jeu d’une partie de l’élite gouvernementale et de la hiérarchie militaire, qui n’attendait que cela pour réduire la crise anglophone à une simple question d’insurrection justifiant une réponse exclusivement militaire. Cette frange radicale du pouvoir est convaincue qu’elle pourra rapidement réprimer l’insurrection avant la prochaine élection. Mais c’est un calcul dangereux, car il est difficile de venir à bout d’une insurrection, même artisanale, lorsqu’elle bénéficie du soutien d’une partie de la population.

**2018 : l’année de tous les dangers**

Pour l’heure, cette insurrection n’est véritablement présente que dans le département de la Manyu. Si elle se propage aux autres départements du Sud-Ouest, ou même au Nord-Ouest, où le sentiment séparatiste est fort, elle pourrait devenir ingérable. En réalité, il ne manque plus aux séparatistes violents que les ressources pour lever une armée. Une partie de la population radicalisée les soutient et la main-d’œuvre est disponible à la fois au Cameroun et parmi les réfugiés. Cela aurait des répercussions au Nigeria où le soutien aux militants anglophones existe sans doute au niveau local. Le Sud-Est du Nigéria est depuis longtemps le lieu d’une série de contestations irrédentistes ou sécessionnistes et présente de nombreuses affinités ethniques et politiques avec le Sud-Ouest du Cameroun.

En cas d’intensification de l’insurrection, le risque que les régions francophones soient touchées est élevé, d’autant que plusieurs des séparatistes menacent d’étendre la violence au pays tout entier. Un tel scénario déstabiliserait profondément et durablement le Cameroun, et le parti au pouvoir en payerait sans doute le prix lors des élections prévues en automne 2018. Le cout économique et humanitaire serait énorme. Le ministre des Finances a déjà annoncé que le taux de croissance du PIB du Cameroun de 6 pour cent anticipé au début l’année n’était en réalité que de 3,7 pour cent. Bien que la crise anglophone ne soit pas la seule cause de ce recul, elle y a certainement contribué.

Si un dialogue politique n’est pas rapidement amorcé, le Cameroun pourrait se retrouver en 2018, en pleine année électorale, dans une situation économique et sécuritaire encore plus délicate. La formation progressive d’une insurrection armée oblige certes à une réponse militaire, mais celle-ci doit être proportionnée et respectueuse des droits humains. La solution politique doit rester prioritaire. [Celle-ci passe nécessairement par un dialogue sur le fédéralisme et la décentralisation qui devrait être impulsé par le chef de l’Etat camerounais lui-même.](http://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/central-africa/cameroon/cameroons-anglophone-crisis-escalating-heres-how-it-could-be-resolved)

Le discours traditionnel de fin d’année offre au président camerounais une occasion idoine pour apaiser la situation, prendre des mesures de décrispation et annoncer ce dialogue. Les partenaires internationaux ont encore la possibilité d’encourager une initiative en ce sens afin d’éviter au Cameroun un enlisement dans un long conflit fratricide. Jusqu’à présent, ils se sont contentés du service minimum, estimant à tort qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une crise menaçant directement leurs intérêts économiques, politiques et sécuritaires. Or une déstabilisation du Cameroun aurait nécessairement des répercussions sous-régionales tant en Afrique centrale qu’au Nigéria et est susceptible d’affaiblir la lutte contre Boko Haram.

L’enjeu est de taille : une déstabilisation du Cameroun serait nuisible pour tous. C’est pourquoi toutes les parties doivent concentrer leurs efforts en direction d’une solution politique à la crise, y compris en proposant leurs services de médiation. Pour les Nations unies et l’Union africaine en particulier, c’est l’occasion de redorer le blason de leur mécanisme d’alerte précoce, d’éviter que cette crise ne se transforme progressivement en insurrection et de prévenir un embrasement dangereux.",268,"French"
2386984,"Le HCR se félicite du lancement de la réinstallation en France des réfugiés vivant Tchad La Représentation du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés, le HCR, au Tchad se félicite du départ pour la France cette semaine, dans le cadre de la réinstallation, des 30 réfugiés vivant au Tchad.  

Ils font partie des 206 réfugiés soudanais et centrafricains retenus à l’issue des missions de l’Office français pour la protection des réfugiés et des Apatrides (OFPRA) et du Ministère français de l’Intérieur en octobre et en novembre dernier, sur les 217 personnes interviewées.  

Le premier groupe de 19 personnes a quitté N’Djamena par avion, le dimanche 17 décembre 2017 et est arrivé en France le lendemain tandis que le deuxième groupe de 11 personnes a effectué son voyage dans la nuit de mardi 19 décembre 2017.  
D’autres départs seront organisés pendant les prochaines semaines.  

La première mission des chargées de protection d’OFPRA, dirigée par son Directeur,  
Pascal Brice, a fait suite à l’annonce en octobre dernier du président français Emmanuel Macron, selon laquelle la France accueillera 3.000 réfugiés vivant au Tchad et au Niger au cours des deux prochaines années.  

Le Représentant du HCR au Tchad, Mbili Michel Ambaoumba, a salué « ce geste de solidarité de la France en faveur des réfugiés vivant au Tchad », avant de souligner la réinstallation comme outil de protection et solution durable à la situation des réfugiés. Les autres solutions sont le rapatriement volontaire des réfugiés vers leurs pays d’origine et l’intégration locale dans le pays d’accueil, en l’occurrence le Tchad.

M. Ambaoumba a expliqué qu’avant l’initiative salutaire de la France d’accueillir des réfugiés vivant au Tchad et le départ cette semaine de ceux qui ont été retenus, seulement 139 personnes ont été réinstallées cette année, contre 648 l’année dernière. Ces deux dernières années, les réfugiés ont été acceptés par les EtatsUnis, le Canada, la Suède, le Danemark et en Finlande.  

Il a précisé que de 2007 à fin novembre 2017, au total 2.564 réfugiés ont bénéficié de cette solution durable et outil de protection qu’est la réinstallation.  

Le Tchad accueille sur son territoire plus de 410.000 réfugiés depuis plus d’une décennie pour la majorité. Ces réfugiés sont originaires de la région soudanaise du Darfour (plus de 323.000 personnes), de la République Centrafricaine (plus 76.000 personnes) et du Nigeria (9.300 personnes) et sont installés dans des camps dans l’est, le sud et l’ouest dans la région du Lac [Tchad], respectivement. 4.000 réfugiés vivent à N’Djamena, la capitale.

2386869,"Les filles peuvent mieux qu’aller puiser de l’eau ! ENFANT REPORTER – Voici l’histoire de Shukuru, une jeune fille de 13 ans et élève en 4e année primaire. Victime de discrimination, elle n’a pas pu commencer l’école à l’âge de 6 ans comme ses frères. Son histoire m’a beaucoup touché.

**Née d’une famille nombreuse, sœur unique de cinq frères**  
A Bunia, en Province de l’Ituri, réside une famille de six enfants dont Shukuru est la seule fille. Pour elle, être née fille est un sujet de discrimination et de sous-estimation.

« A 6 ans, je voulais débuter l’école comme mes frères. Mes parents ont dit que comme je suis leur unique fille, je devrais passer plus de temps auprès de ma mère parce que les filles sont faites pour le ménage. Mon petit frère, Trésor, a été inscrit à l’école maternelle à 4 ans ! Un jour, j’ai demandé à mon père pourquoi je ne pouvais pas étudier. Il ne m’a pas répondu, mais ma mère m’a dit : ‘’Tu es une fille et tu finiras par te marier un jour pour fonder ton foyer. Et pour cela, tu n’as pas besoin d’aller à l’école’’. Maman a poursuivi en soulignant qu’on devait donner la priorité à mes frères car ils devaient prendre la responsabilité de la famille. »

**Débuter l’école primaire à 10 ans !**   
Finalement, Shukuru a débuté sa première année primaire à l’âge de 10 ans. Aujourd’hui, elle a 13 ans et regrette de ne pas avoir commencé plus tôt.

« Si beaucoup d’enfants de mon âge sont en 1e année secondaire, moi je suis encore en 4e primaire à cause de mes parents. Mes camarades de classe me taquinent que je suis la vieille de la classe. Le temps perdu est irrécupérable ; mes parents m’ont rendu un mauvais service » dit-elle, avec un ton encombré des pleurs.

**La discrimination des filles jusqu’à l’école**   
La discrimination se poursuit à l’école aussi. Shukuru raconte : « Un mois après la rentrée scolaire, l’école a organisé les élections des doyens de classes. Je me suis portée candidate. Mais ce sont seulement les filles qui ont voté pour moi : les garçons ont dit qu’une fille ne peut pas les diriger ».

Par ailleurs, Shukuru est submergée par les travaux ménagers au détriment de ses études. Aller puiser de l’eau, préparer la nourriture, lessiver, entretenir la maison, aller au marché, etc. restent son pain quotidien.

**Oui pour l’égalité des droits entre filles et garçons**   
Il y a longtemps que nos sœurs subissent tous genre de souffrances liées au genre. Mais les filles ne sont pas faites que pour aller puiser de l’eau ! L’article 2 de la Convention relative aux Droits de l’Enfant souligne la non-discrimination entre les enfants. De plus, l’article 5 de la Loi portant Protection de l’Enfant stipule que « tout acte discriminatoire à l’égard des enfants est interdit ».

Nous, Enfants Reporters, dénonçons la discrimination dont sont victimes les filles dans notre pays, nos écoles et nos familles respectives. Les filles peuvent mieux qu’aller puiser de l’eau !",268,"French"

2386579,"Burundi : des légumes frais pour la santé des détenus malnutris **Des produits frais comme des choux, des amarantes, des poireaux et des carottes ont été cultivés dans quatre prisons du nord et du centre du Burundi.**

Depuis les premières récoltes, les détenus souffrant de malnutrition en consomment 100gr par jour afin que leur santé s'améliore.

Gervais Hajayandi, Directeur Général de la DGAP, explique: « Ces jardins permettent aux détenus, qui entrent souvent en détention avec un indice de masse corporelle (IMC) trop bas, de bénéficier quotidiennement de légumes frais qui font maintenant partie intégrante de la chaîne alimentaire ».

Bonaventure Ndayisenga, agronome au CICR, a suivi la mise en place de ces jardins et a introduit une pratique de culture échelonnée, ainsi que la conservation des choux par lacto-fermentation afin de faire face aux éventuelles ruptures de stock.

Les infrastructures pénitentiaires, comme les stocks, les abris bois et les cuisines, ont également été réhabilitées par le CICR pour faciliter la préparation de ces aliments. 87% de détenus malnutris ont retrouvé un poids normal entre février et août 2017.

C'est le cas de Milo* qui a retrouvé la santé en consommant ces produits frais pendant plusieurs mois. Aujourd'hui, il est en charge de la cuisine des malnutris à la prison de Gitega, et s'assure que ces détenus consomment des produits frais quotidiennement.

Diddy*, détenu agronome à la prison de Muramvya, affirme que ce travail a renforcé les liens sociaux entre les détenus maraîchers en charge des jardins. De plus, cette expérience, attestée par un certificat de reconnaissance de capacité, leur donne une meilleure perspective de réinsertion une fois leur peine purgée.

En novembre dernier, après plus d'une année de travail conjoint, le CICR a officiellement remis ces jardins à la DGAP, qui pérennisera le projet.

La DGAP étendra son programme de lutte contre la malnutrition dans quatre autres prisons du pays en 2018, avec le soutien du CICR.

2386569,"Haïti-Droits humains : La migration, une réalité à gérer ensemble au bénéfice de tous, souhaitent des institutions nationales et internationales **Protéger les migrants les plus vulnérables**

P-au-P, 19 déc. 2017 [AlterPresse] --- La migration constitue une réalité à gérer ensemble au bénéfice de toutes et de tous, soulignent des institutions nationales et internationales, à l’occasion de la journée internationale des migrants, le lundi 18 décembre 2017.

Ce point de vue a été exprimé dans un communiqué de presse conjoint du ministère des Haïtiens vivants à l’étranger (Mhave), de l’Office nationale de la migration (Onm) et l’Organisation internationale pour les migrations (Oim) et transmis à l’agence en ligne AlterPresse.

L’Oim réitère son soutien inconditionnel aux ministères, autorités et institutions haïtiennes en charge de la migration pour adresser les problèmes migratoires internes et externes auxquels l’état Haïtien doit faire face.

Elle réaffirme son engagement à protéger les migrants les plus vulnérables et supporter le gouvernement haïtien dans ses efforts pour assurer et promouvoir une migration régulière et informée au bénéfice de tous et de toutes.

Traite des êtres humains, exploitations, contrebande, propagation de maladies transmissibles, manque d’assistance à la réintégration pour les rapatriés et les déportés, traversées maritimes ou terrestres périlleuses, font partie d’un ensemble de problèmes dont des milliers de migrants haïtiens font face en se déplaçant vers les pays voisins.

Le nombre d’Haïtiens qui vivent à l’étranger est estimé à deux millions. A l’heure actuelle, les diasporas haïtiennes résident dans toute la région Caraïbe, aux États-Unis, au Canada, en France et, plus récemment, en Équateur, au Brésil et au Chili.

Les États-Unis abritent la plus grande population de migrants haïtiens, dont un nombre important vit également en République dominicaine (329 mille), au Canada (93 mille), en France (74 mille) et aux Bahamas (28 mille), précise le communiqué de presse.

Cette diaspora apporte également ses compétences, ses connaissances et ses capacités à ses pays d’accueil tout en restant désireuse de soutenir le développement de leur pays d’origine, font remarque ces institutions.

En 2017, la diaspora haïtienne à travers le monde a transféré, par le biais des transferts réguliers de fonds, un montant correspondant à 31.2 % du Produit intérieur brut (Pib) du pays.

Les transferts d’argents de la diaspora vers Haïti dépassent largement les montants additionnels de la valeur des exportations et de l’aide internationale au développement, fait savoir la titulaire du Mhave, Stéphanie Auguste.

8,312 migrantes et migrants haïtiens ont été rapatriés, durant le mois de juillet 2017, à 
la frontière haïtiano-dominicaine. 1,217 autres ont été rapatriés, au mois de juin 2017, au niveau de Belladère / Comendador (Elias Piña, l’une des 32 provinces de la République Dominicaine), Malpasse Malpaso (Jimani) et Ouanaminthe /Dajabon.

Jusqu’au mois de juillet 2017, les services chiliens d’immigration ont dénombré l’arrivée de 44,289 citoyennes et citoyens haïtiens, dans un pays, où, selon certaines données, il n’y avait pas plus de 20 ressortissants d’Haïti, en 1973. [la emb gp apr 19/12/2017 12 :30]",268,"French"

Parmi les droits des détenus, il y a aussi le droit à l’eau. Ce que venait de poser comme acte le partenaire MONUSCO, pour moi, je suis l’homme le plus heureux. je pousse un ouf de soulagement!». C’est à travers ces mots, que le Directeur de la prison centrale de Kananga a marqué sa satisfaction lors de la modeste cérémonie de la pose de la première pierre du forage que la MONUSCO va réaliser dans cet établissement pénitentiaire.

Cette cérémonie de lancement des travaux du forage financé par la MONUSCO à hauteur de 10.990,00 US$, a réuni les autorités de la MONUSCO et de la prison centrale en présence du Ministre provincial de la justice.  

Dans la prison centrale de Kananga l’accès à l’eau potable est très difficile. Le petit puits dont dispose la prison est suppléé par la MONUSCO qui fournit 10 litres par semaine pour chaque détenu.

Pour le Directeur de la prison, je le cite : «Quand l’ouvrage sera achevé , se sera un ouf de soulagement. On aura maintenant l’eau, et on saura désormais comment répondre par rapport au besoin des quelques 800 détenus dont 24 femmes que compte la prison. En effet, sans eau, c’est vraiment difficile que les détenus vivent en paix.»

Au niveau de la Prison centrale de Tshikapa où la situation n’est pas non plus reluisante avec environ 190 détenus dont 6 femmes; la pose de la première pierre du forage dans cet espace carcéral a été présidée par le Chef de Bureau de la MONUSCO Kananga assisté du Team Leader unité de correction de la MONUSCO en présence des autorités provinciales conduites par le Gouverneur Mr. Marc Manyanga.

Selon le Directeur de la prison de Tshikapa «cet acte de la MONUSCO sort la population carcérale de Tshikapa d’un rêve datant de l’époque coloniale.» Le Ministre provincial de l’intérieur et de la Justice du Kasaï dans son allocution a remercié le donateur tout en indiquant que «ceci témoigne du prix qu’attache la MONUSCO aux difficultés rencontrées dans la province du Kasaï en général et dans la prison centrale de Tshikapa en particulier.»

Le forage d’eau à la prison de Tshikapa est financé par la MONUSCO à environ 14.900,00 US$.

Cette  journée de campagne est initiée par le bureau régional de la coordination des associations et ONG  féminines du Mali (CAFO) et financé par le fonds de consolidation de la paix de la MINUSMA, alloué pour la promotion des initiatives ""Genre"", et géré par ONU FEMMES. Elle visait à sensibiliser les femmes de la région de Gao, sur la mise en œuvre du processus national de RSS-DDR et le rôle de vecteurs de cohésion qu’elles doivent y jouer.

Cette rencontre a été l’occasion pour les femmes des cercles de Gao, Ansongo et Bourem, de se retrouver pour échanger sur les défis rencontrés sur le terrain et les pistes de solutions pour une prise en compte de leurs préoccupations. Une fierté pour madame Lalla Maiga, Présidente de la coordination régionale de la CAFO. Celle-ci a mis l’accent sur la nécessité d’informer les femmes à tous les niveaux, sur le processus de paix, y compris la sensibilisation sur le processus de RSS et de DDR. « L’initiative de la CAFO est un exemple pour toutes les structures existantes et opérant dans la région de Gao. Elles se sont senties concernées et ont fait appel à la MINUSMA pour s’imprégner du processus afin de mieux percevoir le rôle qu’elles doivent jouer dans le processus de RSS-DDR et de la paix, » a déclaré M. Hamzata Moussa Diallo de la Commission Nationale du Désarmement, Démobilisation et Réinsertion (CNDDR), représentant le gouverneur de la région de Gao.  

Au cours de cette journée, les femmes ont échangé sur quatre thématiques que sont : Le rôle et la place de la femme dans le processus de RSS-DDR et de Cantonnement : difficultés et Solutions ; Comment restaurer la confiance entre les Forces de Défense et de Sécurité, les jeunes, les femmes et les politiques pour renforcer la sécurité dans la région de Gao ? ; Quelles sont les meilleures initiatives basées sur le genre ou actions à considérer pour faire avancer le processus de cantonnement de RSS-DDR ? ; Quelles stratégies mettre en place pour la représentativité des femmes dans le processus de paix ?

Elles se sont ainsi reparties en groupes pour se pencher sur chacune des thématiques, afin de trouver des solutions appropriées qui changeront les données, de façon positive pour une meilleure implication des femmes dans le processus de RSS-DDR. « Les femmes, de par leur  poids démographique et leurs places dans la famille, constituent un atout majeur qui peut contribuer à instaurer durablement la paix et la prospérité économique si elles sont bien formées, conscientisées et réellement impliquées dans le processus de paix et de cohésion sociale, » a rappelé Mme Ndeye Yandé Kane, Cheffe intérimaire du Bureau de la MINUSMA à Gao.

En plus de voir intensifiées les campagnes de sensibilisation à tous les niveaux, les participants ont recommandé, à l’issue de la rencontre, l’association massive des femmes et des jeunes à toutes les prises de décisions sur la RSS-DDR et le cantonnement ; la multiplication des opportunités d’échange entre la jeunesse et les forces de défense et de sécurité.",268,"French"

A cet effet, « 23 armes, 7 roquettes, 2 mortiers et 31 munitions ont été collectés », a-t-elle dit, rappelant qu’à Bangui, « 74 combattants dont 8 femmes ont été désarmés et démobilisés les 12 au 13 décembre 2017 ». 

De son côté, le porte-parole de la composante police de la MINUSCA, le Lieutenant-colonel Oana Andreea Popescu, est revenue sur la cérémonie d’ouverture officielle du Commissariat de Bambari en présence du ministre centrafricain de l’Intérieur et de la Sécurité publique. Selon elle, « 30 policiers sont affectés dans le service et recevront l’appui total de la Police de la MINUSCA déjà présente dans la ville depuis 2015 avec quelque 148 hommes ». La composante police de la MINUSCA a également organisé une formation aux techniques et tactiques d’intervention spécialisée au profit de 55 forces de sécurité intérieures dont quatre personnels féminins a été clôturée le 15 décembre 2017 après 6 semaines de formation intensive pratique à l’école nationale de police de Bangui. 

Pour sa part, le porte-parole de la Force, le Lieutenant-colonel Côme Ndayiragije, a présenté les mesures prises par la Force de la MINUSCA, conjointement avec l’UNPol et les Forces de sécurité intérieures pour sécuriser les fêtes de fin d’année dans le pays. « Outre la multiplication des patrouilles motorisées et pédestres, la Force a procédé au renforcement des mesures de sécurité au niveau des différents points de contrôles, rendant ainsi davantage dissuasive sa présence », a-t-il indiqué.",268,"French"
2386499,"Un peu de sourire pour des enfants de Kaga-Bandoro La joie et le bonheur étaient perceptibles sur le visage de chacun des plus de 800 enfants qui ont assisté à la fête organisée, dimanche 17 décembre 2017. C’est maintenant devenu une tradition bien établie dans la ville de Kaga-Bandoro, les enfants de toutes les communautés, musulmans comme chrétiens, sont invités pendant la période des fêtes pour célébrer avec le personnel de la Mission.

La fête a commencé avec des prières faites par un prêtre et un imam, qui ont mis l’accent sur la paix, la réconciliation, la cohésion sociale et le vivre-ensemble, invitant la population à œuvrer ensemble dans l’unité pour favoriser le retour d’une paix durable afin d’assurer la stabilité et le développement du pays au bénéfice de toutes les composantes sociales. 

Le préfet de la Nana-Gribizi, le colonel Augustin Tombou, qui a récemment pris fonction,  s’est félicité de la tenue de cet évènement et appelé la population à travailler ensemble avec les autorités et la MINUSCA pour faire régner la paix et la cohésion sociale. 

_« C’est un  moment de réjouissance qui réunit les enfants des deux communautés [musulmane et chrétienne] qui représentent l’avenir de Kaga-Bandoro. Je remercie vivement la MINUSCA pour ce rassemblement qui contribue à la promotion de la cohésion sociale et du vivre-ensemble »,_ a-t-il déclaré.

Pour sa part, le chef de bureau de la MINUSCA dans le secteur centre, Renner Onana, a souligné l’importance pour le personnel de la Mission de passer des moments de partage et de fraternité avec ces enfants qui sont les bâtisseurs de la Centrafrique de demain. 

_«Aujourd’hui, nous sommes ici en tant que pères, mères, frères, et sœurs, pour donner un peu d’espoir à ces enfants, qui sont les principales victimes de la crise actuelle. En les accueillant ici, nous leur ouvrons nos bras et nos cœurs pour leur montrer que, comme tous les enfants du monde, ils ont également le droit de célébrer les fêtes de Noel et de fin d’année dans la joie et l’allégresse, et surtout de voir l’avenir avec optimisme»,_ a indiqué M. Onana.

Les enfants ont pris part à diverses activités sportives et ludiques, entre autres, des compétitions de course au sac, de football, de chaise musicale, de dessin, etc. Des prix ont été décernés aux gagnants, mais pas seulement, car tous les enfants sont repartis avec des cadeaux. Un repas leur a été servi par le contingent pakistanais, tandis que les bangladais ont procuré de l’assistance médicale et des médicaments à ceux qui en avaient besoin. 

_« Je suis très heureux d’avoir pris part à cette fête et d’avoir partagé ce moment inoubliable avec tous les enfants de la ville. Au-delà de la nourriture et de la boisson qu’on nous a servies, j’ai surtout apprécié la rencontre avec d’autres enfants venus de différents quartiers pour vivre cet évènement dans  la fraternité et la convivialité »,_ s’est réjoui D.M. un jeune musulman de 9 ans qui a participé au concours de dessin.

La fête des enfants fut belle et restera gravée dans la mémoire des centaines d’enfants qui y ont pris part. Selon celle qui est au cœur de l’initiative de cette rencontre, Nyanga Jaward, surnommée Maman Kaga par la population locale, le succès de cet évènement a été rendu possible grâce à la contribution de tout le personnel, aussi bien en uniforme que civil.

Et comme elle le dit si bien, _« nous sommes ici pour servir l’humanité, sous le drapeau des Nations Unies, mais notre service à l’humanité ne se limite pas simplement à notre travail en tant que fonctionnaire de  l’ONU. En tant qu’individus, les gens qui souffrent s’attendent à ce que nous leur tendions le bras et que nous leur exprimions notre compassion et notre fraternité de toutes les façons possibles. Nous avons assisté ici à l’expression de notre solidarité pour assister les plus vulnérables. Tout le personnel s’est mobilisé afin de donner à ces enfants la possibilité d’envisager un avenir radieux avec de l’espoir, de l’amour, et le désir de travailler pour y arriver»_ .",268,"French"
2386494,"43 combattants volontairement désarmés à Bambari Lancée le 30 aout dernier à Bangui, l’opération pilote du projet Désarmement Démobilisation Réinsertion (DDR) s’est achevée ce 19 décembre 2017 par l’étape de Bambari. À cette occasion, 43 combattants issus de l’Unité pour la Paix en Centrafrique (UPC), de la tendance Mokom des Anti-Balakas et du Rassemblement Patriotique pour la Renaissance de la Centrafrique (RPRC) ont été volontairement désarmés et démobilisés. Conduite par une équipe mobile de l’Unité d’Exécution du Programme national de DDR (UEPNDDR), cette opération pilote a bénéficié du soutien technique de la MINUSCA.

Pour Samuel Touatena,  chef de la mission de l’UEPNDDR, la phase pilote de Bambari a dépassé les objectifs attendus : « si le bilan de cette opération pilote au niveau national est satisfaisant, les résultats de Bambari sont bien au-delà des attentes, vu la mobilisation des groupes armés à mettre à disposition leurs hommes pour déposer leurs armes ». En effet, durant trois jours, sur le site de la mairie de Bambari qui a abrité les opérations, les combattants des trois groupes armés ont scrupuleusement respecté les différentes étapes du processus au sein des cellules techniques mises en place dans le cadre de l’opération pilote. 

De la phase de sensibilisation au passage par la Cellule de Vérification et Criblage ou même lors de la visite chez le médecin et le psychologue, la quarantaine de combattants démobilisés ont suivi dans la discipline le processus. « Tous les combattants mis à disposition par l’UPC sont motivés parce qu’ils ont été sensibilisés sur cette seconde chance qui leur est offerte à travers le DDR. Auparavant, ils défendaient une portion du territoire avec une partie de la population centrafricaine et maintenant une partie d’entre eux a l’opportunité de défendre tout le territoire de la République sous la bannière de l’Etat et au service de tout le peuple centrafricain »,reconnait Souleymane Daouda, conseiller politique et porte-parole du groupe armé UPC. 

Du haut de ses 22 ans, Issa, qui a intégré l’UPC depuis 2013, estime que le moment est venu de quitter définitivement et sans contrainte les rangs de son groupe armé et d’entamer une nouvelle vie. « Mon souhait est d’intégrer les Forces armées centrafricaines pour contribuer à la sécurisation de mon pays, mais si cela ne se réalisait pas, je serais malgré tout heureux d’être accompagné par le programme DDR afin de réussir ma réinsertion socio-économique parce qu’on peut aussi devenir quelqu’un sans passer par les armes », avance-t-il.

A l’issue des deux opérations de DDR pilote conduites à Bambari en octobre et décembre 2017, 48 éléments des groupes armés ont été désarmés et démobilisés, près d’une trentaine d’armes collectées et plus d’une cinquantaine de munitions et autres engins explosifs ont été déposés.

L’opération pilote du DDR a consisté à désarmer et à démobiliser 560 combattants issus de 14 groupes armés en vue de leur intégration dans les forces de défense ou leur réintégration sociale. Chaque groupe armé a fourni 40 éléments : 20 parmi eux  seront intégrés dans l’armée nationale et les 20 autres  seront orientés vers la réintégration socio-économique et communautaire, via un appui pour des activités génératrices de revenus individuelles ou collectives, ainsi que des subventions de projets en matière de relèvement de la communauté. Ce projet pilote est censé servir de test au programme national DDR qui vise à désarmer, démobiliser et réintégrer 7.000 ex-combattants éligibles.",268,"French"
2386489,"La FAO et le PAM intensifient la lutte contre la faim dans le Grand Kasaï **La FAO et le PAM intensifient la lutte contre la faim dans le Grand Kasaï**

**20 décembre 2017, Kinshasa** – Dans un contexte de souffrance humaine intense, l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO) et le Programme alimentaire mondial (PAM) unissent leurs efforts pour atténuer certains des effets du conflit dans le Grand Kasaï, en République démocratique du Congo. Les deux agences des Nations Unies peuvent compter sur un financement de 10 millions de dollars du gouvernement belge pour améliorer l'accès à la nourriture de plus de 100 000 personnes. Quelque 18 000 ménages - déplacés, rapatriés ou familles d'accueil - en bénéficieront.

«Grâce à cette importante contribution, nous sommes en mesure de redoubler d'efforts et de travailler ensemble en étroite collaboration pour empêcher les populations, et notamment les enfants, de mourir de faim et de malnutrition», a déclaré M. Alexis Bonte, Représentant de la FAO par intérim.

«Ces interventions protégeront non seulement les personnes vulnérables, mais aideront aussi à relancer la production agricole et renforceront la cohésion sociale dans les communautés touchées par la crise», a souligné, de son côté, M. Claude Jibidar, Représentant du PAM en RDC.

Dans le cadre du projet, le PAM distribuera de la farine de maïs enrichie, des légumineuses, de l'huile végétale enrichie et du sel iodé, ainsi que de l'argent. Les enfants âgés de 6 à 59 mois, ainsi que les femmes enceintes et allaitantes, seront pris en charge pendant trois mois avec des suppléments nutritifs spéciaux. Pour sa part, la FAO fournira des kits pour cultiver des légumes - houe, râteau, pelle, arrosoir, semences de légumes et de fruits - qui permettront à chaque famille de manger à sa faim pendant deux mois et de vendre le surplus.

Le projet prévoit des formations en élevage de cochons d’Inde comme source de protéines et en traitement et commercialisation du bambou comme bois de chauffage, ustensiles de cuisine, paniers, canoës, matériel de pêche et clôtures. Les jardins potagers à proximité des centres de santé et des associations de femmes fourniront, quant à eux, des micronutriments, tels que le fer et le zinc, aux enfants souffrant de malnutrition et aux femmes enceintes et allaitantes.

L'initiative conjointe s’effectuera en partenariat avec le Ministère de l'agriculture de la RDC et des ONG locales. Mais, bien qu’elle arrive à point nommé, elle ne saurait répondre toute seule à l’immensité des besoins humanitaires.

Le conflit au Kasaï, anciennement une région productrice de maïs, a forcé un million de personnes à quitter leurs foyers et à abandonner leurs terres. Quelque 3,2 millions de personnes souffrent actuellement de faim aiguë et la malnutrition infantile est largement répandue.

La tragédie endurée par le peuple congolais exige une plus grande solidarité. La FAO et le PAM plaident en faveur d'un financement considérablement accru pour répondre aux besoins. Surtout, les deux agences appellent à une paix durable qui permette à tout un chacun de produire sa propre nourriture, de reconstruire ses moyens d’existence et d’espérer en un avenir meilleur et prospère.",268,"French"
2386479,"Migrations, prévention des conflits, ODD, réforme de l'ONU : les priorités de l'Assemblée générale pour 2018 20 décembre 2017 – Les questions des migrations, de la prévention des conflits, du développement durable et de la réforme de l'ONU seront les priorités de la 72e session de l'Assemblée générale en 2018, a indiqué mercredi son Président Miroslav Lajčák.

« Nous continuerons notre travail sur le Pacte mondial pour des migrations, sûres, ordonnées et régulières », a déclaré M. Lajčák lors d'une conférence de presse au siège de l'ONU, se félicitant des débats constructifs et de l'atmosphère positive durant les phases de consultations et préparatoires.

« Les prochaines étapes seront les négociations intergouvernementales qui commenceront en février avec l'objectif de les conclure avant juillet », a dit le Président de l'Assemblée générale qui organisera en parallèle des réunions avec plusieurs acteurs du monde universitaire, de la société civile, des ONG et du secteur privé. Des réunions prévues afin de prendre en compte les points de vue de l'ensemble de la société.

Les 24 et 25 avril, M. Lajčák organisera une réunion de haut-niveau consacrée à la consolidation de la paix. « Ce sera une bonne opportunité pour nous concentrer sur le travail des Nations Unies en matière de paix durable et de prévention des conflits », a-t-il dit.

En 2018, le Président de l'Assemblée générale entend également contribuer aux Objectifs de développement durable (ODD) à travers l'organisation de trois événements entre mars et juin.

M. Lajčák participera ainsi au lancement le 22 mars de la décennie internationale de l'eau pour le développement durable.

En mai, l'Assemblée générale organisera un événement sur la jeunesse axé l'éducation, l'emploi et la prévention du radicalisme. « Nous ne voulons faire de cet événement une réunion de routine. Nous voulons que ce programme soit conçu avec les jeunes », a dit M. Lajčák qui ne souhaite « pas seulement parler aux jeunes », mais également « écouter ce que les jeunes ont à dire sur le travail de l'ONU ».

En juin, le Président de l'Assemblée générale organisera une réunion consacrée au financement du développement. « Nous avons besoin de traiter les manques importants de financement lorsqu'il s'agit de mettre en place les ODD », a dit M. Lajčák. « La vérité est qu'avec le budget et le rythme actuels, nous ne pourrons pas atteindre les ODD avant 2030. Et donc nous avons besoin de renforcer le lien entre les ODD et les ressources financières qui sont disponibles avec le secteur privé ».

La réforme de l'ONU initiée par le Secrétaire général sera également au cœur des priorités de la 72e session de l'Assemblée générale en 2018. M. Lajčák a annoncé que l'Assemblée générale a adopté mercredi par consensus une résolution sur l'architecture de paix et de sécurité.

2386469,"RDC : Jean-Pierre Lacroix affirme qu'il y aura une enquête « très poussée» sur les Casques bleus tués au Beni Le Secrétaire général adjoint des Nations Unies pour les opérations de maintien de la Paix, Jean-Pierre Lacroix a séjourné mardi 19 décembre à Beni au Nord-Kivu.

Il a encouragé les Casques bleus tanzaniens de la MONUSCO à poursuivre leur mission de protection des civils dans la région, en dépit des pertes subies notamment lors de la dernière attaque attribuée aux présumés rebelles ougandais des ADF.

Dans cette interview exclusive accordée à Radio Okapi, il aborde aussi les questions politiques, principalement la situation des élections en République démocratique du Congo. Il appelle à la mise en place des mesures de décrispation pour «améliorer le climat». Interview.

**Monsieur Jean-Pierre Lacroix, vous arrivez en RDC après un séjour en Tanzanie pour un hommage aux Casques bleus tués. Le gouvernement tanzanien demande aux Nations unies de diligenter une enquête transparente, internationale et urgente. Avez-vous évoqué cette question avec la Tanzanie ?**

C'est un incident très grave. Toutes nos pensées sont toujours tournées vers les victimes et les familles des morts mais aussi les blessés auxquels on souhaite un prompt rétablissement. Il y aura une enquête très poussée qui sera faite. J'ai eu l'occasion de dire aux autorités tanzaniennes civiles et militaires, mais aussi aux responsables militaires des pays qui contribuent à la brigade d'intervention, que cette enquête se fera en étroite liaison avec eux.

**A quel niveau les Nations unies vont s'impliquer pour l'aboutissement de cette enquête ?**

L'enquête sera conduite avec les moyens qu'il faudra. Les conclusions et les recommandations qui en résulteront seront évidemment examinées, traitées au plus haut niveau et le plus rapidement possible. Il y a des groupes armés notamment des ADF et autres qui intensifient leurs activités, oppriment la population et pillent les ressources. Comme nous dérangeons par nos activités, ces groupes s'attaquent à nous. C'est peut-être aussi une manière de leur part de reconnaitre que nous avons un impact puisque nous les empêchons de faire ce qu'ils veulent. Il faut à tout prix travailler pour être plus effectif dans la réaction contre ces groupes et c'est sera l'objet de l'enquête. Bien attendu, ce travail devra aussi être fait avec les autorités de la République démocratique du Congo, parce que c'est leur responsabilité première d'assurer la sécurité sur le territoire de ce pays. Nous, nous sommes en appui. J'ai eu l'occasion de m'entretenir de ce sujet avec son excellence le président de la République et différents responsables du gouvernement congolais. Nous sommes d'accord pour déterminer que nous allons travailler ensemble.

Il est trop tôt pour dire quelles conclusions nous allons tirer. Nous avons quelques idées, quelques éléments déjà. Je me suis moi-même rendu sur le lieu de l'incident aujourd'hui [mardi 19 décembre] avec d'autres collègues de la MONUSCO mais il faut évier de tirer des conclusions trop rapides, et en même temps il faut agir très rapidement et regarder tous les éléments qui ont contribué à créer des conditions de cet incident.

**Il y a eu une période d'accalmie dans la zone de Beni. Et les trois derniers mois ont été sanglants. Les rebelles visent les services de sécurité, surtout les Casques bleus. Est-ce que ces faits ne mettent pas en doute les capacités de la MONUSCO à assurer son mandat de protection des civils ?**

Vous avez raison. Ce groupe avait été affaibli par le passé, par une action conjointe de la MONUSCO et des Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo. Ce qui prouve qu'il est possible d'affaiblir ce groupe. La MONUSCO a prouvé qu'elle pouvait affaiblir ce groupe, pas seulement les ADF, je pense aussi à la résistance efficace qui a permis d'empêcher la prise d'Uvira [Sud-Kivu] par un groupe de Maï-Maï Yakutumba. Il y en a d'autres aussi. Donc il faut regarder les actions de la MONUSCO dans une approche globale. Reconnaitre les échecs, les limites, travailler dessus et reconnaitre le succès qui existent aussi mais aussi développer la coopération avec les Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo.

**Jean-Pierre Lacroix, abordons maintenant l'actualité politique congolaise. Le calendrier électoral a été publié le mois dernier par la Commission électorale nationale indépendante. A quelques jours de la fin de 2017, vous confirmez l'appui des Nations unies ?**

Les Nations unies vont continuer à appuyer le processus électoral bien entendu. Comme je l'ai indiqué au président de la République et aux responsables gouvernementaux, avec qui je me suis entretenu, la MONUSCO est à disposition et continuera à apporter tout le soutien que nous pouvons apporter dans le cadre de nos moyens. Je crois qu'il faut dire deux choses : l'organisation des élections est une prérogative nationale. C'est la responsabilité première des autorités congolaises et du peuple congolais. La deuxième chose, nous allons soutenir mais pas seul. Nous avons des partenaires, des pays de la région, l'Union africaine, l'Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), la SADC. Tous, ensemble, nous allons travailler collectivement pour soutenir ce processus.

**A l'approche du 31 décembre, la tension ne fait que monter au pays. Des manifestations publiques sont réprimées ou interdites. L'opposition estime qu'il faut une transition sans le président Joseph Kabila. Qu'est-ce que vous pouvez dire à ce sujet ?**

Je crois qu'il est important pour que le processus électoral puisse se tenir et que le calendrier électoral soit tenu, que les conditions soient réunies pour la tenue des élections. Ça suppose d'une part les moyens, l'organisation, le planning, ce que nous allons soutenir. Ça suppose également qu'il y ait un climat qui soit de nature à permettre des élections libres et démocratiques. Dans ce contexte, il est évident que certaines mesures peuvent être prises, qu'on appelle des mesures de décrispation qui peuvent contribuer à améliorer le climat et à donner à tous le sentiment qu'ils pourront pleinement participer et être des partenaires et acteurs de ce processus électoral.

**L'année 2017 se termine. Quel message vous pouvez adresser aux Congolais et aux membres des missions de la paix au monde ?**

Aux Congolais, je leur dirai que la MONUSCO et les Nations unies sont à leur côté. Parfois il y a des revers et nous ne faisons pas tous ce que nous souhaiterions pouvoir faire. Mais nous faisons le maximum et nous travaillons tous les jours pour faire davantage encore aux côtés des Congolais. Aux membres des missions de la paix des Nations unies partout dans le monde et notamment ici dans ce pays, je voudrais d'abord leur dire toute mon admiration pour le travail qui est fait souvent dans des circonstances extrêmement difficiles. Je voudrais leur dire ma solidarité et mes pensées pour ceux qui ont perdu la vie au service des Nations unies, pour leurs familles. Surtout à l'approche de la nouvelle année. A tous, je voudrais leur dire que je leur souhaite tous les meilleurs pour l'année prochaine.

2386294,"Haiti : Rapport de la mission FAO/PAM d'evaluation des récoltes et de la sécurité alimentaire **Faits saillants**

- La campagne agricole de printemps de 2017 a été caractérisée par des précipitations mal réparties et en quantité insuffisante. Il s’agit donc de la quatrième campagne consécutive depuis 2014 qui s’écarte significativement de la tendance des précipitations à long terme.
   
- Les disponibilités alimentaires intérieures sont estimées à 550 000 tonnes en 2017, soit environ 3,5 pour cent de moins qu'en 2016 et près de 6 pour cent de moins que la moyenne. Le recul des disponibilités est essentiellement lié à des contractions de la production de maïs et de sorgho.
   
- Les besoins d'importations de céréales pour la campagne de commercialisation 2017/18, principalement du blé et du riz, devraient s’élever à 703 000 tonnes, soit environ 20 pour cent de plus qu’en 2016.
   
- Étant donné que selon les premières évaluations officielles l’ouragan Irma n’a pas fait de dégâts majeurs, les disponibilités alimentaires intérieures ne devraient reculer que d’environ 23 000 tonnes.
    
- En août, les prix des denrées alimentaires se sont établis à des niveaux relativement élevés, proches de ceux observés au cours la période critique 2014-2016, durant laquelle le pays a souffert d’une sécheresse prolongée, provoquée par El Niño. Le coût du panier alimentaire représentatif était toujours plus élevé entre mai et septembre 2017 qu'à la même période un an plus tôt.
   
- Selon l’Évaluation de la sécurité alimentaire dans les situations d’urgence (ESASU) publiée en mai 2017, à l'apogée de la période de soudure et avant les récoltes de la campagne agricole de printemps de 2017, environ 3 millions de personnes étaient considérées en situation d'insécurité alimentaire.
   
- La Mission estime que le nombre de personnes en situation d'insécurité alimentaire a légèrement diminué depuis janvier 2017, mais que le pays a toujours besoin d'une aide ciblée, en particulier dans les zones où les moyens de subsistance et les logements n'ont pas été pleinement rétablis après l'ouragan Matthew qui a dévasté le pays à la fin de 2016.

1. VUE D’ENSEMBLE 
 
Une mission conjointe FAO/PAM d'évaluation des récoltes et de la sécurité alimentaire (CFSAM) s'est rendue en Haïti du 2 au 26 août afin d’évaluer la production alimentaire de la campagne agricole de printemps de 2017, qui s'étend de mars à août, et d'apprécier la situation de la sécurité alimentaire. La campagne agricole de printemps représente quelque 60 pour cent de la production céréalière annuelle et s’avère très importante pour déterminer les disponibilités alimentaires et apprécier la sécurité alimentaire au cours de la prochaine année agricole 2017/18. La Mission était composée de fonctionnaires de la FAO, du PAM et du Ministère de l'agriculture, des ressources naturelles et du développement rural (MARNDR) d'Haïti, qui était représenté par la Coordination nationale pour la sécurité alimentaire (CNSA) d’Haïti et l’Unité de statistique agricole et informatique (USAI). Des membres du personnel du Réseau des systèmes d'alerte précoce contre la famine (FEWSNET) et du Centre commun de recherche (CCR) de la Commission européenne ont collaboré étroitement avec la Mission en tant qu'observateurs. 
 
Les membres de la Mission ont interrogé des agriculteurs au sujet de leurs perceptions à l’égard des récoltes de la campagne agricole de printemps. Pour ce faire, la Mission a organisé des entretiens de groupe dans 70 des 140 communes que compte le pays, dans l'ensemble des dix départements du pays (tableau 1). Après trois années consécutives de récoltes sévèrement réduites en raison de la sécheresse liée au phénomène El Niño, entre 2014 et 2016, et les dégâts provoqués par le passage de l'ouragan Matthew à la fin de 2016, il était essentiel d'évaluer la production de la campagne de printemps de 2017 et son incidence sur la situation de la sécurité alimentaire du pays. 
 
La campagne agricole de printemps de 2017, qui s’étend de mars à août, a été caractérisée pas des précipitations irrégulières. Les précipitations ont commencé plus tôt par rapport aux tendances historiques, et ont culminé à la fin du mois d'avril au lieu de la fin du mois de mai. Puis la période sèche, qui survient généralement avant les premières récoltes en juin s’est prolongée de plus de dix jours. Les pluies précoces et intenses tombées en avril ont nui aux rendements des légumineuses, qui ont souffert d’un excès de précipitations et d’humidité. L’épisode de sécheresse prolongée en juin, durant la période de floraison ou de remplissage des grains, a compromis les rendements du maïs. La production de la campagne de printemps de 2017 devrait être inférieure de 15 pour cent à celle de 2016 pour le maïs, de 18 pour cent pour le sorgho et de 6 pour cent pour les légumineuses. Toutefois, si les prochaines campagnes d'automne et d'hiver, à récolter à partir de respectivement décembre 2017 et mars 2018, restent inchangées par rapport à 2016, la production agricole de 2017 devrait croître de 7 pour cent par rapport à l'an dernier. Ces estimations supposent des pertes de culture négligeables liées au passage du cyclone Irma, qui a traversé les départements du nord",268,"French"

On trouvera ci-après le texte de la déclaration à la presse faite, le 8 décembre, par le Président du Conseil de sécurité pour le mois de décembre, M. Koro Bessho (Japon):

Les membres du Conseil de sécurité se sont félicités du retour au Liban du Premier Ministre Saad Hariri et de sa décision de poursuivre son mandat. Dans ce contexte, ils ont salué la tenue à Paris, le 8 décembre 2017, d’une réunion ministérielle du Groupe international d’appui au Liban, présidée par l’Organisation des Nations Unies et la France, à laquelle a participé le Premier Ministre libanais, et ont accueilli favorablement la Déclaration conjointe publiée à l’issue de la réunion. Ils ont également salué les efforts qui avaient contribué à la reprise du Conseil des ministres, le 5 décembre 2017.

Les membres du Conseil ont réaffirmé leur ferme appui à la stabilité, à la sécurité, à l’intégrité territoriale, à la souveraineté et à l’indépendance politique du Liban, conformément aux résolutions 1701 (2006), 1680 (2006) et 1559 (2004), ainsi qu’aux autres résolutions du Conseil et aux déclarations du Président du Conseil sur la situation au Liban.

Les membres du Conseil ont rappelé qu’il fallait protéger le Liban des crises qui déstabilisaient le Moyen-Orient. À cet égard, ils ont demandé à tous les États et organisations de la région d’œuvrer en faveur de la stabilité et de la sécurité politiques, sociales, économiques et financières du Liban dans le strict respect de la souveraineté et de l’intégrité du pays.

Les membres du Conseil ont demandé à toutes les parties libanaises de mettre en œuvre une politique concrète de dissociation des conflits externes, qui est une priorité importante énoncée dans de précédentes déclarations, notamment la Déclaration de Baabda de 2012.

Les membres du Conseil ont réaffirmé leur soutien à l’action menée par les autorités libanaises pour rétablir le fonctionnement normal des institutions et préparer la tenue d’élections législatives d’ici à mai 2018. Ils ont engagé le Gouvernement libanais à accélérer encore son programme de réformes pour que s’installe une stabilité politique et économique reposant sur un État fonctionnel, transparent et démocratique, avec la pleine participation des femmes et des hommes.

Les membres du Conseil ont réaffirmé la nécessité de mettre en œuvre dans leur intégralité toutes les résolutions pertinentes du Conseil de sécurité, dont les résolutions 1559 (2004), 1701 (2006) et 2373 (2017). Ils ont salué le rôle joué par la Force intérimaire des Nations Unies au Liban (FINUL), qui s’emploie à maintenir le calme le long de la Ligne bleue, et sa coopération avec l’Armée libanaise dans le but d’étendre le contrôle du Gouvernement libanais à l’ensemble du territoire libanais. Ils ont rappelé les mesures dynamiques que la FINUL avait prises pour appliquer la résolution 2373 (2017) et l’ont encouragée à poursuivre ces efforts.

Compte tenu des problèmes de sécurité que connaît le Liban, en particulier la menace terroriste, les membres du Conseil ont salué le rôle joué par l’Armée libanaise et par toutes les institutions chargées de la sécurité de l’État pour protéger le pays, ses frontières et sa population. Ils ont rappelé qu’il importait de respecter les engagements déjà pris, à savoir notamment que seul l’État libanais pouvait détenir des armes, et demandé à toutes les parties libanaises de reprendre les discussions en vue de parvenir à un consensus sur une stratégie de défense nationale. Ils ont rappelé que l’Armée libanaise constituait les seules forces armées légitimes du Liban, comme le prévoyaient la Constitution libanaise et l’Accord de Taëf.

Les membres du Conseil ont salué la générosité des efforts consentis par les autorités et le peuple libanais, qui n’avaient cessé d’accueillir des réfugiés syriens. Ils ont rappelé que le retour des réfugiés devrait se faire, lorsque les conditions le permettraient, dans le strict respect du droit international, notamment le droit international des réfugiés, et conformément aux principes humanitaires et au principe de non-refoulement.

Les membres du Conseil ont encouragé la communauté internationale à continuer d’apporter son appui à la stabilité politique, sociale et économique du Liban, et à le renforcer, notamment en fournissant une aide aux communautés libanaises qui accueillaient des réfugiés et aux réfugiés qui se trouvaient au Liban.

Ils ont pris note du programme énoncé dans la déclaration finale du Groupe international d’appui au Liban.

Les membres du Conseil ont prié instamment le Groupe international d’appui au Liban de continuer de s’attacher, en coordonnant son action avec celle du Bureau de la Coordonnatrice spéciale des Nations Unies pour le Liban, à chercher des moyens de concourir à trouver une solution aux problèmes qui menacent la sécurité et la stabilité du Liban.

2385934,"LRA Crisis Tracker Rapport Mensuel | novembre 2017 *Les niveaux de violence dans la région frontalière Mbomou-Uélé * ont continué de baisser en Novembre par rapport aux mois précédents, en partie parce que la LRA a commis le moins d’attaques (deux) et le moins d’enlèvements (zéro) par mois depuis le mois de Juin 2008. Cependant, les conflits intercommunautaires dans les préfectures du Haut Mbomou et du Mbomou en République Centrafricaine (RCA) se sont poursuivis en Novembre 2017, avec des hommes armés de la communauté Peuhl qui ont commis deux attaques dans lesquels au moins 20 civils ont été tués.*


Les mois de Novembre et début Décembre ont également mis en lumière le sort des rescapés de la LRA en RDC et en RCA. Au moins 11 rescapés de la LRA, dont trois enfants, sont bloqués dans la région frontalière de Mbomou-Uele, les processus de rapatriement et de regroupement familial étant bloqués dans de nombreuses régions.

**Niveau bas historique pour la violence de la LRA**

Les deux attaques de la LRA en Novembre représentent le nombre le plus bas d’attaques de la LRA depuis au moins Juin 2008, l’un des premiers mois pour lesquels le LRA Crisis Tracker dispose de données. Pour le contexte, de 2008 à 2016, la LRA a commis en moyenne 15 attaques et 40 enlèvements de civils au mois de Novembre.

Les deux attaques de la LRA en Novembre 2017 se sont produites près de Pambayamba, une petite communauté minière située dans la région reculée du nord-est de la préfecture de la Haute Kotto en RCA. Dans les deux attaques, les combattants de la LRA ont tendu une embuscade aux motocyclistes et les ont pillés, notamment de savon, de sucre et d’argent. Les attaques de la LRA près de Pambayamba ont prolongé une tendance à l’intensification de l’activité de la LRA dans le nord-est de la Haute Kotto depuis Juillet 2017, y compris deux attaques au nord de Pambayamba en Octobre 2017.

**La tension intercommunale dans les Mbomous persiste**

Les tensions entre la minorité Peuhl et d’autres groupes ethniques dans les préfectures du Mbomou et du Haut Mbomou continuent de couver. Depuis Avril 2017, 38% des incidents recensés par le LRA Crisis Tracker dans les deux préfectures concernaient des civils Peuhls armés ou des combattants de l’Union pour la Paix en Centrafrique (UPC), un groupe armé à majorité Peuhl actif dans l’est de la RCA. Certains de ces incidents concernaient des civils Peuhls ou des combattants de l’UPC qui affrontaient ou ciblaient des acteurs armés et des civils appartenant à d’autres groupes ethniques. En outre, 7% des incidents de violence perpétrés depuis le mois d’Avril concernaient des civils Peuhls ciblés par des groupes armés, notamment des anti-balaka et la LRA.

Au mois de Novembre, des Peuls armés ont commis deux attaques contre des civils, dont l’assassinat d’au moins 20 civils dans la communauté de Dembia dans le Mbomou le 20 Novembre. L’attaque contre Dembia fait suite aux efforts d’une milice armée locale à Zemio d’obliger les Peuls à quitter Zemio après des mois de tensions et d’affrontements persistants. Alors que les Peuls se déplaçaient vers l’ouest en direction de Dembia, le Système d’Alerte Précoce à haute fréquence (SAP) a été utilisé pour avertir les civils du risque que des hommes armés approchent de la communauté. Bien que les affrontements qui ont suivi aient tué 20 civils, l’alerte a permis à de nombreux femmes et enfants d’éviter la violence.

**Les rescapés de la LRA, y compris des femmes et des enfants, restent bloqués**

Au cours des 11 premiers mois de 2017, 46 personnes ont échappé à la captivité à long terme de la LRA, définie comme ayant passé six mois ou plus dans la LRA. Parmi ces 46 évadés, 17 étaient des enfants et 22 étaient des jeunes adultes (entre 18-24 ans), et 7 étaient des hommes de plus de 24.

Retrouver les familles des rescapés de longue date de la LRA et les ramener chez eux en toute sécurité est souvent un processus difficile. Beaucoup s’échappent dans un pays autre que celui où ils ont été enlevés, y compris 19 des 46 rescapés de longue date de la LRA en 2017. En outre, beaucoup s’échappent de la LRA dans des communautés éloignées auxquelles les acteurs humanitaires internationaux ont du mal à accéder. D’autres ont été enlevés dans des communautés qui connaissent actuellement un conflit, ce qui soulève des inquiétudes quant à leur capacité de rentrer chez eux en toute sécurité. Enfin, de nombreux acteurs internationaux, autrefois chargés d’aider à rapatrier les rescapés de la LRA, ont retiré ou réduit leur empreinte opérationnelle dans les zones touchées par la LRA.

En raison de ces difficultés, certains rescapés de la LRA sont obligés de subir une séparation prolongée de leur famille en attendant d’être transportés chez eux et sont privés de services médicaux et psychosociaux appropriés. Cette souffrance est aggravée par le traumatisme mental et physique qu’ils ont subi pendant leur captivité par la LRA. Les rapports du LRA Crisis Tracker montrent qu’il y a au moins 11 rescapés de longue date de la LRA, dont trois enfants, bloqués dans des communautés en RDC et en RCA, aucun progrès n’étant fait pour les réunir avec leurs familles. Au moins trois autres rescapés récents de longue date de la LRA risquent d’être bloqués si des mesures immédiates ne sont pas prises pour les réunir avec leurs familles.

Les 11 rescapés de longue date de la LRA actuellement bloqués sont:

+ Bangui (RCA): Un combattant Ougandais de la LRA  souffrant de graves problèmes de santé mentale est détenu dans une prison depuis mi-2016 dans des circonstances juridiques peu claires;

+ Haute Kotto (RCA): Trois mineurs dans une communauté éloignée sans accès à des services médicaux ou psychosociaux; l’un d’entre eux y est bloqué pendant plus de six mois

+ Haut Mbomou (RCA): Une femme Congolaise est bloquée dans le centre de transit pour les rescapés de la LRA

+ Mbomou (RCA): Deux Congolais et deux Sud Soudanais sont bloqués dans un site isolé;

+ Haut Uele (RDC): Deux jeunes hommes Centrafricains Two Central African sont sous la responsabilité de l’ONU depuis Juin 2017.

2385604,"Note de plaidoyer: Les femmes et les filles du NORD-KIVU à nouveau à risque de violence, Octobre 2017 **VIOLENCE ET DEPLACEMENT AU NORD KIVU**

Au moins 1,242,000 personnes vivent toujours en situation de déplacement au Nord Kivu, suite à l’instabilité et l’insécurité qui règne dans la province et qui aggrave une situation chronique. En effet, le Nord-Kivu reste en proie aux violences et conflits qui engendrent une situation humanitaire alarmante dans plusieurs territoires avec une récurrence des violences sexuelles. 

Les groupes et milices armés font la loi presque partout et les communautés sont souvent opposées les unes aux autres. Les opérations militaires déclenchées par l’armée nationale pour rétablir l’ordre et les efforts de sensibilisation et de médiation communautaires engagés par divers acteurs n’ont pas encore produit les effets escomptés. Les populations sont obligées de fuir leurs milieux de vie pour chercher refuge dans des localités plus ou moins stables où les conditions de vie demeurent précaires. 

Le Nord Kivu est une province connue pour l’incidence élevé des violences sexuelles liées au conflit depuis plusieurs années à l’instar de celles commises à Walikale en 2010 mais elle compte aussi une prévalence élevé des violences sexuelles. Elle n’est pas non plus épargnée d’autres formes des violences basées sur le genre (VBG) tels que les violences conjugales.  

Les territoires les plus affectés sont ceux où les groupes armés sont actifs et/ou ceux où les opérations militaires sont en cours. Ainsi, des VBG, y compris l’exploitation sexuelle des enfants, l’exposition aux viols lors de la collecte de bois, les abandons scolaires liés aux grossesses pré-coces, etc, ont été rapportés dans les territoires de Beni, Butembo et Lubero, Masisi, Nyiragongo, Rutshuru et Walikale. Les acteurs ont aussi noté que la part des violences basées sur le genre imputées à des civils ou se produisant sans lien directe avec les conflits est en hausse dans un contexte d’impunité généralisée. Un contexte où les crimes de violences sexuelles sont peu déclarés, à cause de la peur de la stigmatisation, des représailles, de la méfiance qui règne entre la population et les services de sécurité et de l’inefficacité des systèmes de protection.",268,"French"
2385354,"L'Union européenne augmente son soutien a la Convention sur l'interdiction des mines anti-personnelle, appelle sur ceux qui encore utilisent des mines terrestres à cesser leur utilisation Vienne, Bruxelles, Genève - L'Union européenne (UE) a annoncé un soutien supplémentaire pour aider les pays à s'acquitter de leurs obligations en vertu de la Convention sur l'interdiction des mines antipersonnel, traité interdisant l'utilisation, la production, le transfert et le stockage de ces armes. 

L'UE a réaffirmé son ferme soutien à la Convention lors de la seizième Assemblée des États parties à la Convention qui se tient à Vienne. Plus de 400 représentants d'organisations gouvernementales, internationales et non gouvernementales se réunissent à l'ONU à Vienne pour discuter la mise en œuvre du ce traité de désarmement et humanitaire signé il y a 20 ans. 

« L'UE condamne l'utilisation de mines antipersonnel par quiconque, qu'il s'agisse d'États ou d'acteurs non étatiques. Nous appelons également tous les États non parties à la Convention et les acteurs non étatiques à cesser de fabriquer, de transférer et d'utiliser ces armes », a déclaré Jacek Bylica, l’Envoyé Spécial de l'UE pour le désarmement et la non-prolifération. « L'utilisation de mines antipersonnel improvisées dans le contexte de la guerre urbaine est particulièrement préoccupante, car elle vise spécifiquement à terroriser les civils et à empêcher le retour des personnes déplacées et des réfugiés. C'est un facteur clé qui oblige les gens à quitter leur foyer et un facteur important derrière la crise actuelle des réfugiés », a ajouté Jacek Bylica. 

« L'utilisation de mines antipersonnel improvisées a créé une nouvelle contamination à grande échelle en Iraq, un État partie à la Convention, et en Libye et en Syrie, qui ne sont pas encore parties. L'utilisation de ces mines improvisées a entraîné une inversion de la tendance à la baisse du nombre de victimes de mines dans le monde pour la deuxième année consécutive depuis l'entrée en vigueur de la Convention. Les nouvelles menaces doivent être résolues avec détermination, sans détourner l'attention des vastes zones du monde qui restent inaccessibles en raison de la contamination par les mines », a déclaré l'envoyé de l'UE, des pays comme l'Angola, le Cambodge et le Zimbabwe planté il y a des décennies. 

« Leur impact continue d'affecter de manière disproportionnée les communautés rurales, généralement les plus pauvres, ainsi que les minorités et les groupes marginalisés. Ils ne devraient pas être oubliés. À la lumière de ces développements, il est nécessaire de réaffirmer notre engagement en matière de coopération et d'assistance internationales, car l'obligation de débarrasser le monde des mines antipersonnel est un effort collectif de tous les États parties. » 

**Aide financière de l'Union européenne à l'action contre les mines**

L'UE et ses États membres sont l'un des plus grands donateurs au monde pour l'action humanitaire contre les mines. L'aide de l'UE comprend le déminage, l'éducation aux risques, l'aide aux victimes, la destruction des stocks et profite à presque tous les pays fortement touchés: Tchad, Colombie, Croatie, Irak, République démocratique populaire lao, Liban, Libye, Myanmar, Syrie et Ukraine. 

Au cours de la période 2012-2016, l'UE, à travers ses institutions et ses États membres, a engagé plus de 600 millions d'euros pour lutter contre la menace des mines et des restes explosifs de guerre dans les pays touchés par des conflits. 

Cependant, certains États parties à la Convention ont besoin d'un soutien supplémentaire pour le renforcement des capacités afin d'identifier et de surmonter les défis restants s'ils veulent réaliser leur ambition d'un monde sans mines d'ici 2025. 

L'Union européenne, par une décision du Conseil, allouera 2,3 millions d'euros supplémentaires pour promouvoir l'adhésion universelle au traité, y compris par l'intermédiaire des Envoyés spéciaux de la Convention, le Prince Mired de Jordanie et la Princesse Astrid de Belgique. D'autres projets au titre de la Décision du Conseil aideront les États parties à mettre en œuvre leurs engagements en matière de déminage, de destruction des stocks et d'assistance aux victimes dans le cadre du Plan d'action de Maputo de 2014 de la Convention. 

« La décision facilitera les réunions nationales dans les pays touchés par les mines avec les autorités compétentes, les organisations internationales et non gouvernementales, les donateurs et les communautés affectées par les mines. Dans l'esprit de partenariat inscrit dans la Convention, la mise en œuvre de la présente décision inclura la participation du Colauréat du Prix Nobel de la Paix 1997, la Campagne internationale pour l'interdiction des mines terrestres, le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge et d'autres organisations internationales, » a dit Jacek Bylica 

**La Convention sur l'interdiction des mines antipersonnel**
 
La Convention a été adoptée à Oslo et signée à Ottawa en décembre 1997. À ce jour, il y a 163 États parties - la semaine dernière, Sri Lanka, fortement touchée par les mines, a adhéré au traité. Ensemble, les Parties ont détruit plus de 51 millions de mines antipersonnel et libéré des millions d'hectares de terres autrefois contaminées. À ce jour, 30 États ont déclaré de dépolluer ses états, tandis que 31 continuent d'exécuter leur obligation de déminage. 29 États parties ont déclaré la responsabilité d'un grand nombre de personnes - des centaines ou des milliers - de survivants de mines antipersonnel, dont certaines parmi les plus pauvres du monde.",268,"French"

- Villages déserts et incidents de protection : situation alarmante dans le Maniema

- Lancement des travaux de réhabilitation du pont Yuyu à Shabunda

**Aperçu de la situation**

La situation humanitaire reste très préoccupante dans la province du Maniema, en particulier dans les territoires de Kabambare et de Kasongo. Au moins 35 villages des secteurs de Nonda et de Kasenga (Territoire de Kasongo) ainsi que des secteurs de Wamaza, Lulindi et Baombo (Territoire de Kabambare) sont pratiquement déserts selon deux ONG. Les habitants de ces localités se seraient déplacés vers la forêt depuis le 12 décembre en raison de l’insécurité suite aux affrontements entre des groupes armés et l’armée congolaise. Ces populations n’en seraient pas à leur premier mouvement d’après les sources locales. Mais le nombre de déplacés ainsi que les périodes précises de leur mouvement restent à déterminer. En effet, le contexte sécuritaire précaire dans cette région limite l’accès des humanitaires. Les deux ONG dénoncent aussi plusieurs incidents de protection qui seraient commis par des acteurs en armes dans ces deux territoires, notamment le 12 décembre dans les villages de Tengetenge et de Libenga, à environ 30 kilomètres au sud de Kayembe.  

Au Sud-Kivu, le sud du Territoire de Shabunda a de nouveau été secoué cette semaine par des affrontements qui ont provoqué des mouvements de population. Environ 1 800 personnes du groupement Ikama-Kasanza se sont déplacées après des combats entre des groupes armés et l’armée congolaise les 15 et 16 décembre selon la société civile.  

Certains habitants se sont aussi dirigés vers les villages voisins situés en Territoire de Fizi. Depuis début octobre, cette partie du Territoire de Shabunda, proche de la province du Maniema, connaît d’importants déplacements de population dus aux violences armées.  

Les incidents de protection se poursuivent à l’est du Territoire de Shabunda, dans le groupement Bamuguba-Sud. Le pillage par des éléments de groupes armés du village de Kamungini, à environ 18 kilomètres de Kigulube, a été rapporté durant la semaine. Les incidents de protection sont en forte hausse dans cette zone, où entre le 12 et le 22 novembre, quelque 150 personnes ont déjà été dépouillées de leurs biens d’après les sources locales.",268,"French"

2384934,"Le HCR salue le démarrage du rapatriement volontaire des réfugiés tchadiens du Darfour Les autorités administratives et traditionnelles de la région de Sila dans la souspréfecture de Moudeina, dans l’est du Tchad, ont accueilli 301 rapatriés tchadiens en provenance du Soudan le mardi 19 décembre 2017 dans un centre de transit érigé dans le village dont des habitants sont également venus nombreux pour souhaiter la bienvenue à leurs compatriotes.  

Sur place, il y avait également une forte présence des humanitaires composée notamment du personnel du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les refugies ainsi que du partenaire ADES, une ONG tchadienne qui s’occupe de la prise en charge immédiate des rapatriés. La police tchadienne était présente pour assurer la sécurité ainsi que d’autres formalités d’usage.  

Il s’agit du premier groupe de plus de 4.000 réfugiés tchadiens vivant dans la région soudanaise du Darfour, qui ont fait le choix de rentrer chez eux après plus d’une décennie d’exile.  

Dans le cadre de l’accord tripartite signé en Mai dernier, le HCR et les gouvernements du Soudan et du Tchad ont commencé à faciliter leur rapatriement volontaire en les transportant et leur apportant une assistance en espèce, en articles ménagers et en matériaux de construction. Cet appui est destiné à faciliter la réintégration des rapatriés dans leurs villages d’origine au Tchad.  

En 2017, trois convois sont programmés pour rapatrier environ 1000 réfugiés. Ils seront accueillis au centre de transit de Moudeina, dans la région de Sila, dans l’est du Tchad. Certains s’installeront dans ce village tandis que les autres iront vers d’autres localités de la région qu’ils avaient fuient à cause de la situation sécuritaire qui y prévalait entre 2005 et 2007.  

Ce mouvement de rapatriement volontaire se poursuivra en 2018 vers d’autres destinations de la même région de Sila. « Les réfugiés pourraient choisir d’aller s’établir où ils souhaitent au Tchad », a expliqué Peggy Penshi-a-Maneng Chef de la Sous-délégation du HCR a Goz-beida.  

Pour le premier convoi les autorités traditionnelles et administratives de la région se sont mobilisées pour souhaiter la bienvenue à leurs compatriotes et leur expliquer les dispositions prises pour faciliter leur réintégration au Tchad.  

Le HCR appuie les gouvernements tchadien et soudanais à veiller à ce que les réfugiés soient bien préparés au processus de retour et de réintégration et à ce que leurs besoins de protection juridique et physique soient assurés.  

Le processus de rapatriement volontaire comprend un contrôle médical, des mesures de protections contre la violence sexuelle et sexiste et d'autres risques de protection pendant le transport et pendant la période de réintégration dans leurs villages.  

Le HCR travaillera également avec le gouvernement du Tchad et d'autres partenaires pour améliorer la fourniture de services de base dans les zones de retour.  

Le Représentant du HCR au Tchad, Mbili Michel Ambaoumba, s’est félicité « de l’arrivée de ce premier convoi et des deux autres qui sont annoncés avant la fin de l’année, ajoutant que c’est le fruit des efforts conjugues des autorités du Soudan et du Tchad, et du personnel du HCR ainsi que leurs partenaires dans les deux pays ».  

Pour M. Ambaoumba, ce retour volontaire au Tchad « dans la sécurité et la dignité, constitue la solution durable par excellence pour ces réfugiés qui ont passé plus d’une décennie en exile.».  

Pour sa part le Secrétaire General de la région de Sila représentant le Gouverneur a salué ce retour tout en assurant que « le gouvernement tchadien dans la mesure de ses possibilités soutiendra ces rapatriés pour s’intégrer dans leurs communautés pour recommencer une vie normale ». Il a par ailleurs lancé un appel aux organismes qui ont toujours accompagné le Tchad à poursuivre sans relâche leurs activités. « Je pense naturellement au HCR, qui fait déjà beaucoup pour prendre en charge les réfugiés soudanais » a-t-il ajouté.  

Au mois de mai dernier, un accord tripartite a été signé entre le gouvernement de la République du Tchad, le gouvernement de la République du Soudan et le HCR qui fournit le cadre légal pour le rapatriement volontaire des réfugiés tchadiens souhaitant retourner dans leur pays.  
Les réfugiés tchadiens qui opteront de rester au Darfour continueront à bénéficier de la protection internationale.  

Le Tchad est lui-même un important pays d'accueil de réfugiés avec plus de 410 000 personnes originaires principalement du Darfour, de la République centrafricaine et du Nigéria vivant principalement dans les camps de l'est, du sud et du lac, dans l'ouest du pays.

2384664,"Massacres au Kasaï : des crimes contre l’humanité au service d’un chaos organisé Paris - Kinshasa, le 20 décembre 2017. En juillet 2017, une mission d’enquête de la FIDH et de ses organisations membres en République démocratique du Congo (RDC) s’est rendue en Angola auprès de réfugié.es congolais.es ayant fui les massacres commis sur le territoire de Kamonia, dans la province du Kasaï. Les témoignages accablants publiés aujourd’hui rendent compte de l’ampleur et de la gravité des crimes commis contre les civil.es, par les forces de défense et de sécurité congolaises et leurs supplétifs de la milice appelée Bana Mura. Leur degré d’organisation et de planification révèle une stratégie de terreur et de destruction délibérée, ayant abouti à des crimes contre l’humanité. Ces violences sont intervenues en réponse au soulèvement d’une milice locale, les Kamuina Nsapu, elle-même responsable d’exactions graves. Alors que le calendrier électoral ne cesse d’être repoussé en RDC, les atrocités commises au Kasaï s’inscrivent dans une instrumentalisation récurrente des tensions et violences par le régime de Joseph Kabila, afin de conserver le pouvoir par le chaos et la diversion.

Villages détruits à l’arme lourde, attaques d’hôpitaux et de lieux de culte, exécutions, tortures et mutilations, violences sexuelles, pillages, arrestations et détentions en dehors de toute procédure légale. Les témoignages récoltés par l’équipe de la FIDH auprès de réfugié.es congolais.es en Angola illustrent le calvaire subi durant au moins cinq mois par les populations civiles de Kamonia.

Le rapport rend compte d’exactions perpétrées dans une dizaine de villages. Il revient en particulier sur le massacre commis le 24 avril 2017 dans le village de Cinq, situé à quelques kilomètres de la frontière angolaise, et qui comptait alors une dizaine de milliers d’habitant.es. Les milices Bana Mura y ont déferlé dans l’objectif d’y éliminer les civil.es, appartenant principalement à l’ethnie Luba, à l’initiative et avec le soutien de l’armée et de la police congolaises. L’attaque a fait des centaines de mort.es, dont de nombreux.ses femmes et enfants, exécuté.es principalement par balle, machette, ou brûlé.es vif.ves. Lors de l’attaque de l’hôpital de Cinq, plus d’une centaine de patient.es, dont des femmes enceintes, ainsi que du personnel soignant a été exécutée.

De nombreux.ses survivant.es se sont enfui.es à travers la brousse. Plusieurs centaines ont été recensé.es par l’agence des Nations unies pour les réfugié.es (HCR), arrivé.es en Angola au terme d’un voyage aux allures de supplice, puisque traqué.es par les milices jusqu’à la frontière. Parmi elles/eux, de nombreux.ses enfants blessé.es à coups de machette.

D’après les témoignages recueillis par l’équipe de la FIDH et les informations transmises par des sources locales, notamment des organisations congolaises de défense des droits humains, d’autres villages auraient été touchés par des actes de violence similaires entre mars et août 2017. Nos organisations ont compilé une liste d’une vingtaine de villages supplémentaires où de telles attaques auraient eu lieu. Les témoignages de survivant.es de certaines de ces attaques sont inclus dans le présent rapport.

La cruauté des exactions commises laisse peu de doute sur l’objectif poursuivi : terroriser, détruire et faire fuir les populations Luba, accusées d’être complices des crimes commis par la milice Kamuina Nsapu et de soutenir l’opposition au régime de Joseph Kabila.

Dans sa dernière partie, le rapport de la FIDH décrit comment les crimes perpétrés sur le territoire de Kamonia ont été planifiés, dirigés et également directement commis par des agents de l’État congolais ainsi que leurs supplétifs des milices Bana Mura, qu’ils ont contribué à structurer et armer. Une liste d’au moins 50 noms de présumé.es responsables des crimes commis sur ce territoire a notamment été établie par nos organisations.

Cette année, pour sa première participation au Concours National, l'Ecole de Matana a présenté les 62 élèves de sa première promotion. La constance de leurs efforts ainsi que la recherche de l'excellence ont permis aux « Aînés » de se hisser à la troisième place du classement national, avec une note moyenne de 74,9%  à l’examen. Au Burundi, ce concours permet de passer dans le cycle post fondamental, l’équivalent du lycée.

Située dans la province de Bururi, l’école a été construite, en 2014, sous l’initiative de l’association FVS-AMADE Burundi, grâce aux subventions du Gouvernement de la Principauté de Monaco et de l’AMADE Mondiale. Les élèves y bénéficient d’une éducation de qualité, leur permettant d’exploiter  au mieux leur potentiel et devenir, pourquoi pas, les futurs cadres de leur pays.

L’établissement abrite un internat. Celui-ci  constitue un cadre confortable et propice aux études pour des enfants dont l’extrême pauvreté pourrait les obliger  à abandonner l’école pour mendier dans les rues, travailler en tant que domestiques ou bien encore, pour les filles, être mariées. Pour ces orphelins et enfants vulnérables, l’école est un véritable levier leur permettant  d’améliorer leurs conditions de vie et celles de leurs familles.

Rappelons que le soutien aux enfants vulnérables et en situation de rue constitue l’un des programmes phares de la Coopération monégasque.",268,"French"
2384394,"Plan national d’adaptation (PNA) du Sénégal : atelier de validation du document de projet Ce 8 décembre 2017 à Dakar, un atelier de validation a réuni toutes les parties prenantes autour du projet du « Plan National d'Adaptation (PNA) du Sénégal ». L’objectif était de partager le document avec les parties prenantes qui mettent en œuvre ou peuvent influencer la mise en œuvre du projet PNA Sénégal afin de valider le document avant sa transmission au Fonds pour l'environnement mondial (FEM). Rappelons que pour l'élaboration du projet « Plan National d'Adaptation (PNA) du Sénégal », le Gouvernement du Sénégal avait sollicité l’appui du PNUD pour l’accès au financement du FEM, par l'intermédiaire du Fonds pour les pays les moins avancés (PMA).

Le projet, dont le budget total est de 2 913 750 USD pour le FEM et 300 000 USD du FEM, a pour objectif le renforcement des capacités des ministères sectoriels et des gouvernements locaux à mieux évaluer les conséquences du changement climatique et à ajuster les politiques et budgets existants pour l'intégration des risques sur le changement climatique à moyen et long terme ainsi que des mesures d'adaptation.

Cet objectif sera atteint grâce: (i) au développement des capacités techniques et fonctionnelles des structures de surveillance du climat et de l'hydrologie, des centres de recherche et des décideurs afin de mieux exploiter les informations disponibles sur le climat passé et futur, biophysique, social, environnemental et économique; stratégies d'adaptation à long terme; et ii) la hiérarchisation et l'intégration des budgets d'adaptation et des budgets connexes au sein des instruments nationaux et infranationaux de développement et de planification sectorielle.

La phase de préparation du projet a permis de rassembler les informations nécessaires à l’élaboration d’un bon document de projet qui pourrait recueillir l’approbation du FEM. Un consultant international et trois consultants nationaux, avec l’accompagnement de la partie gouvernementale et du PNUD ont procédé entre autres tâches à l’analyse détaillée de la situation de référence, l’évaluation des capacités des partenaires de mise en œuvre et des parties prenantes, la description des arrangements de gestion du projet, la définition d’indicateurs et d’objectifs détaillés, la mise en place de partenariats et d’engagements pour le co-financement. Le résultat principal de cette phase est la production d’un document de projet complet en ligne avec les politiques et procédures du PNUD et conforme aux exigences de la stratégie des fonds LDCF.

Les travaux de l’atelier permettront aux parties prenantes de discuter des constats, la stratégie proposée et les activités prévues du projet ; d’assurer l’engagement des parties prenantes ; d’exprimer les apports additionnels ; d’étudier les synergies possibles (cofinancement) ; de valider le contenu de la version finale du document qui sera envoyé au Secrétariat du FEM après l’atelier.

A l’issue de l’atelier :

- Les parties prenantes auront développé une compréhension commune des résultats du et des impacts attendus du projet PNA ;  
- Le Gouvernement du Sénégal et le PNUD partagera la vision de l’innovation apportée par le PNA et d’un agenda sur les prochaines étapes avant le lancement officiel du projet ;  
- Les partenaires financiers et techniques identifieront des synergies avec le PNA et marqueront leur engagement à travers des lettres de co-financement.",268,"French"
2384384,"Tombouctou : deux projets pour renforcer l’etat de droit et le bon fonctionnement de la justice **Le 12 décembre 2017, le Bureau régional de la MINUSMA à Tombouctou, à travers sa Section des Affaires Judiciaires et Pénitentiaires (SAJP) et la Police des Nations Unies (UNPOL), a procédé à la remise de deux projets pour l’amélioration du fonctionnement de la chaine pénale de la région de Tombouctou. Financés pour plus de 200.000.000 de FCFA par le Fonds Fiduciaire (Trust Fund) des Nations Unies en soutien à la paix et à la sécurité au Mali, ces projets concernent la sauvegarde et la restauration des archives du Tribunal de Grande Instance de Tombouctou et le renforcement des capacités opérationnelles des composantes de la chaine pénale.**

Le premier projet est relatif à la sauvegarde et la restauration des archives du Tribunal de Grande Instance de Tombouctou. Financé à hauteur de 26.220.813 FCFA, le but de ce projet est d’accroitre les capacités de gestion et de conservation physique des documents, au sein du Tribunal de Grande instance de Tombouctou.

D’une durée de trois mois, les travaux ont porté sur le dégagement des matériels et le désencombrement de la salle d’archives, le tri des archives utiles, la restauration des archives et leur reluire, l’installation de meubles, d’accessoires d’accueil, de documents d’archives et d’un dispositif de mesures de sécurité. La salle d’archives a également été dotée en matériels et fournitures de reluire et de réparation. Le projet a permis de  classer les archives par thématiques puis, de renforcer les capacités des archivistes du Tribunal de Grande Instances (TGI) en la matière. 

Le second projet concerne le renforcement des capacités opérationnelles des acteurs de la chaîne pénale. Ceux-ci ont été dotés des moyens nécessaires pour mieux assurer leurs fonctions et ce, pour près de 184 millions de Francs CFA (183.626.163 FCFA). Plus spécifiquement, ce projet visait à mettre à la disposition de la Police, de la Gendarmerie, de l’administration pénitentiaire et de la justice, un minibus d’extraction des détenus, deux véhicules pick-up et des motos. Outre l’amélioration des moyens de déplacement, les moyens de communication ont également été renforcés avec la fourniture de téléphones portables regroupés en flottes, des GPS et l’installation d’une connexion internet de haut débit. Des fournitures de bureau dont des ordinateurs portables et fixes, des imprimantes multifonctions, des climatiseurs et réfrigérateurs, des fontaines d’eau, des logiciels de traitement de texte et d’autres matériels nécessaire à l’administration ont également été alloués. Le projet prévoyait également de fournir des matériels de sécurité et de protection des enceintes comme des bâtons de sécurité, des détecteurs de métaux pour la fouille des visiteurs et des miroirs de sécurité, mais aussi des gilets par coups et par balles ou encore des protèges tibias et genoux ainsi que des mallettes de police judiciaires et de constatation. « Ces projets aideront à l’amélioration de la chaine pénale de la région, au renforcement de l’Etat de droit, au retour des autorités étatiques en application à l’Accord pour la Paix et la Réconciliation, pour le règlement durable du conflit, » a déclaré Baye Konaté, le Directeur de Cabinet du Gouverneur de Tombouctou.

Quant au Chargé d’Affaires et Chef de la Coopération de l’Ambassade des Pays-Bas au Mali, M. Paul Tholen, il a rassuré les acteurs de la justice du soutien indéfectible de son pays, à travers la MINUSMA, dans le cadre du renforcement de l’Etat de droit dans cette région, au bénéfice des populations. « Avec notre bonne collaboration avec la Mission onusienne au Mali, nous allons accroitre notre action dans le domaine judiciaire, »  a-t-il conclu.   

**Le retour de l’Etat de droit et l’émergence d’un système judiciaire plus efficace**

L’occupation des régions du nord du Mali par des groupes armés a brutalement freiné le progrès et la croissance économique de la région de Tombouctou. Cette crise a profondément affecté l’autorité de l’Etat et plus particulièrement les différents maillons de la justice et les institutions de sécurité qui ont été sérieusement ébranlées.

En effet, avec la libération de ces régions autrefois occupées, le déploiement de la MINUSMA, la signature de l’Accord pour la Paix et la Réconciliation issu du processus d’Alger et ses arrangements sécuritaires, l’Etat a enclenché un processus visant au retour de ses services publics au Nord du pays et à la restauration de son autorité dans cette partie du territoire nationale. Malgré les efforts fournis de part et d’autre, les structures animant la chaîne pénale notamment les tribunaux, les services de sécurité, les maisons d’arrêt, manquent pour la plupart de moyens de base pour assurer efficacement leurs tâches dans cette région. 

Cependant, la période post-crise se caractérise par un fort besoin de justice. Aujourd’hui l’émergence d’un système judiciaire efficace et qui inspire la confiance aux citoyens, est nécessaire pour assurer la sécurité et la stabilité politique. « Le ministère de la justice a fait du redressement de la justice le socle sur lequel se bâtira le nouvel Etat du Mali. Ce redressement du système judiciaire et pénitentiaire ne saura se faire sans la conjonction de plusieurs facteurs, dont le renforcement des capacités des acteurs de la justice en général et de la chaine pénale en particulier, » a souligné M. Ibrahim Abdoulaye MAIGA, Président des acteurs de la chaine pénale de la région de Tombouctou et non moins Procureur de la république près le TGI de Tombouctou.

Un des défis majeurs auquel les autorités font face, est celui de la lutte contre l’impunité sur la base du principe d’égalité de tous devant la loi. Elle constitue l’une des causes profondes de la répétition des crises  dans le Nord du Mali depuis l’indépendance. « Sans justice il n’y a pas de paix et sans paix il n’y aura pas de développement durable, c’est pourquoi la MINUSMA, conformément à son mandat, a noté comme priorité stratégique d’appuyer la mise en œuvre par le  gouvernement et toutes les parties prenantes pour la paix et la réconciliation de l’accord d’Alger, qui confère une place de choix à la consolidation du pouvoir judiciaire, de manière à assurer l’Etat de droit sur toute l’étendue du territoire malien, » a expliqué Mamane Sani Moussa, le Chef de Bureau par intérim de la MINUSMA à Tombouctou.

La cérémonie de réception a également vu la participation des bénéficiaires, des Chefs de services déconcentrés et techniques de l’Etat, des représentants de la société civile, ainsi des responsables des autres sections substantives de la MINUSMA.",268,"French"

- L’achèvement de la revue ouvre la voie au décaissement de 40,2 millions de dollars.

- Pour appuyer la cohésion sociale et la croissance économique il faut rétablir progressivement l’autorité de l’État et mettre rapidement en œuvre le Plan national de relèvement et de consolidation de la paix.

- Le maintien et l’accélération des efforts de mobilisation des recettes et le renforcement de la transparence budgétaire permettront de dégager la marge de manœuvre budgétaire pour financer les dépenses sociales et les dépenses de développement.

Le 15 décembre 2017, le Conseil d’administration du Fonds monétaire international (FMI) a achevé la troisième revue de l’accord conclu avec la République centrafricaine au titre de la facilité élargie de crédit (FEC) [1]. L’achèvement de la revue ouvre la voie au décaissement de 28,41 millions de DTS (environ 40,2 millions de dollars).

Le Conseil d’administration a également approuvé une demande de relèvement du niveau d’accès aux ressources prévu par l’accord FEC d’un montant de 38,99 millions de DTS (environ 55,1 millions de dollars). Cette augmentation couvrira les considérables besoins de balance des paiements dans le cadre de la stratégie nationale de relèvement et de consolidation de la paix et appuiera la cohésion sociale et la croissance économique.

L’accord conclu avec la République centrafricaine au titre de la FEC a été approuvé par le Conseil d’administration le 20 juillet 2016 (voir [communiqué de presse No. 16/352 ](http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/07/21/20/54/PR16352-Central-African-Republic-IMF-Executive-Board-Approves-Three-Year-Arrangement-Under-the-ECF)) pour un montant de 83,55 millions de DTS (environ 118,1 millions de dollars ou 75 % de la quote-part de la République centrafricaine au FMI). Suite au relèvement du niveau d’accès, le montant total de financement s’élève à 133,68 millions de DTS (environ 189,0 millions de dollars, ou 120 % de la quote-part du pays au FMI).

Les résultats enregistrés dans le cadre du programme jusqu’à la fin juin ont été satisfaisants. Tous les critères de réalisation quantitatifs et objectifs indicatifs ont été observés, à l’exception de l’objectif de recettes intérieures, à l’égard duquel les autorités ont entrepris d’adopter des mesures correctives et pour lequel une dérogation pour non observation a été accordée. Toutes les réformes structurelles ont été mises en œuvre, certes avec quelques retards.

À l’issue des délibérations du Conseil, M. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Directeur général adjoint et Président par intérim, a fait la déclaration suivante :

«Les résultats enregistrés dans le cadre du programme appuyé par la FEC ont été satisfaisants en dépit d’un climat sécuritaire délicat et des conditions humanitaires difficiles. Les autorités ont mis en œuvre leur programme de réformes en s’efforçant par ailleurs de rétablir progressivement la sécurité dans d’autres centres urbains afin de créer des espaces de stabilité, de reconstruction et de croissance.

«La politique budgétaire suit globalement les objectifs fixés. Le budget de 2018 reste ancré sur l’objectif de solde primaire tout en prévoyant une augmentation des dépenses sociales et des investissements. Afin de pouvoir contribuer à cette augmentation, il sera essentiel de redoubler d’efforts dans la mobilisation de recettes intérieures, qui restent faibles. Compte tenu du risque élevé de surendettement que connaît le pays, il est primordial de continuer à faire appel aux dons et de limiter les emprunts, même à des conditions fortement concessionnelles. L’assistance disponible doit être efficacement mise au service de projets prioritaires capables de doper la croissance économique, de créer des emplois et de réduire la pauvreté. La solide mise en œuvre du programme d’investissement et du Plan national de relèvement et de consolidation de la paix permettra d’élargir les perspectives économiques.

«Les réformes structurelles ont avancé, contribuant ainsi au renforcement du compte unique du Trésor, à la rationalisation de la parafiscalité, à l’amélioration de la transparence budgétaire et à la traçabilité des recettes intérieures. La publication trimestrielle des rapports d’exécution budgétaire permet d’assurer un meilleur suivi des dépenses publiques. Il convient d’envisager de réduire davantage les procédures de paiement exceptionnelles car elles peuvent compromettre les progrès récents.

«Le gouvernement a adopté une vaste stratégie d’apurement des arriérés intérieurs. Le remboursement des arriérés contribuera à la croissance, renforcera la crédibilité de l’État et insufflera une nouvelle vigueur au secteur bancaire. Le plan prévoit des mesures pour assurer l’intégrité du processus d’apurement des arriérés.

«Le programme de la République centrafricaine reçoit l’appui de la mise en œuvre de réformes et politiques d’accompagnement par les institutions régionales, y compris un durcissement de la politique monétaire, la suppression des avances statutaires, la solidité de la réglementation et de la supervision bancaires, et la rigueur des contrôles sur l’octroi de crédit aux banques».

2384339,"En RCA, les femmes et les enfants sont les premières victimes des violences (UNICEF) 19 décembre 2017 – Plus de la moitié des Centrafricains ayant besoin d'aide humanitaire sont des enfants, a annoncé mardi le Fonds des Nations Unies pour l'enfance (UNICEF).

Sur les 2,5 millions de Centrafricains dans le besoin, 1,3 million sont des enfants, a précisé l'agence onusienne.

« Les enfants et les femmes sont évidemment les premières victimes », a déclaré la représentante de l'UNICEF en République centrafricaine (RCA), Christine Muhigana, lors d'un point de presse à Genève. « 2017 a été une année très difficile pour les enfants et les femmes en RCA, et nous ne nous attendons malheureusement pas à une amélioration de la situation dans les mois à venir ».

La Centrafrique a connu une augmentation spectaculaire de la violence en 2017. Dans des régions auparavant instables, telles que le centre et le nord-ouest, la situation est restée très tendue. En outre, l'ensemble du sud-ouest, auparavant épargné par la crise, est aujourd'hui la région la plus touchée.

Dans ce contexte de regain de violence, l'accès humanitaire est constamment entravé par les activités des groupes criminels et armés. Cette année seulement, 14 travailleurs humanitaires ont perdu la vie dans le pays et les organisations humanitaires ont dû suspendre temporairement leurs activités dans plusieurs localités.

601.000 personnes sont déplacées à l'intérieur de la RCA (le même nombre qu'au début de l'année 2014) et 538.000 se sont réfugiées à l'étrangee. C'est donc plus d'un Centrafricain sur cinq qui a été chassé de chez lui.

Les violences en RCA ont des conséquences néfastes sur le bien-être des enfants. 20% des écoles du pays sont fermées en raison de l'insécurité. Dans la moitié des établissements scolaires encore ouverts, la moitié des enseignants ne sont pas officiellement certifiés et sont appuyés par leurs communauté.

En 2017, les cas recensés de violations des droits des enfants centrafricains ont augmenté de 50%. « Et nous savons que les chiffres vérifiés ne sont que la partie emergée de l'iceberg en raison des restrictions sur l'accès humanitaire », a dit Mme Muhigana.

Dans ces conditions difficiles, l'UNICEF espère pouvoir fournir des espaces temporaires d'apprentissages pour 85.000 enfants en 2018. Mais l'agence a besoin de fonds pour financer ses activités, notamment la réintégration d'enfants soldats démobilisés et la poursuite de l'acheminement d'aide humanitaire dans les zones reculées.

En 2017, à peine 47% du financement humanitaire nécessaire a été reçu par l'UNICEF. En 2018, les besoins seront plus importants.

« C'est un moment crucial pour le financement », a déclaré Mme Muhigana. « Nous aurons besoin de tout le soutien possible, si nous ne voulons pas que les enfants de RCA soient condamnés à un terrible sort ».",268,"French"
2384324,"Le HCR renforce son soutien aux Camerounais ayant fui au Nigéria **Ceci est un résumé des déclarations du porte-parole du HCR Andrej Mahecic – à qui toute citation peut être attribuée – lors de la conférence de presse du 19 décembre 2017 au Palais des Nations à Genève.**

Le HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés, renforce sa présence dans le sud-est du Nigéria, afin d’apporter un soutien vital à des milliers de personnes ayant fui les troubles dans des zones anglophones du Cameroun.

Depuis l’escalade des tensions entre les forces de sécurité et les manifestants indépendantistes dans la région anglophone du Cameroun en octobre, des équipes conjointes du HCR et du gouvernement ont enregistré 7 204 nouveaux arrivants dans des zones reculées de l’État de Cross River, au Nigéria. Selon leurs informations, des milliers d’autres attendent également d’être enregistrés.

Environ 70 % des demandeurs d’asile enregistrés, en majorité des femmes et des enfants, sont originaires de la région d’Akwaya, dans le sud-ouest du Cameroun. Ils sont accueillis par les communautés locales près de la frontière. Du fait de la poursuite des troubles au Cameroun et de l’arrivée de nombreux demandeurs d’asile, le HCR craint toutefois que les capacités de la population locale ne soient bientôt mises à rude épreuve.

La saison des pluies a aggravé l’état du réseau routier dans cette région reculée, entravant l’acheminement de l’aide. Le HCR et ses partenaires distribuent de la nourriture et des articles de première nécessité, et ils assurent des soins médicaux. Le HCR déploie également davantage de personnel dans la région et coordonne ses activités avec ses partenaires ainsi que les autorités nationales et locales, afin de veiller à satisfaire les besoins de toutes les personnes affectées.

Des ressources supplémentaires seront nécessaires pour venir en aide aux nouveaux arrivants ainsi que renforcer les efforts de coordination et d’aide du HCR. Le HCR au Nigéria et ses partenaires ont élaboré un plan d’urgence pour se préparer à assurer une aide aux nouveaux arrivants.

2383899,"« Les Haricots et La Casserole »: Notes d’Orientation des Cluster Sécurité Alimentaire (SECAL) et Articles Ménagers Essentiels (AME)/ ’NFI’ (Non-Food Items) et Abris en R.D.Congo pour la Coordination et la Mise en Œuvre des Programmes *Préparées Conjointement par le Cluster AME/’NFI’ et Abris et le Cluster Sécurité Alimentaire Décembre 2017*

**Pourquoi Les Notes d’Orientation pour les secteurs AME1 et SECAL2 ?**

Dans le domaine des réponses humanitaires, plusieurs liens techniques et conceptuels existent entre différents secteurs, tels que la Sécurité Alimentaire et la Nutrition ou la Santé et l’Eau, Hygiène, et Assainissement (EHA). D’ailleurs, certains domaines ont des associations importantes pas seulement conceptuelles mais aussi sur le plan opérationnel nécessitant une coordination étroite entre les deux secteurs. Tel est le cas pour la Sécurité Alimentaire (SECAL) et les Articles Ménagers Essentiels3 (AME) qui restent parmi les besoins prioritaires des ménages, surtout ceux affectés par des catastrophes soudaines4 , des mouvements des populations où ils connaissent souvent des pertes importantes de biens, ainsi que les crises chroniques ou prolongées. Lors des mouvements de population (qu’il s’agisse d’un déplacement ou d’un retour), les ménages ne parviennent pas souvent à transporter un grand volume des biens, vivres, articles productifs (outils aratoires, semences, animaux), ainsi que les articles ménagers et personnels. Ainsi dans un contexte de déplacement ou de retour, les ménages ont souvent prioritairement besoin de se nourrir et s’abreuver pour rester en vie, stocker de la nourriture et de l’eau, s’habiller, se laver, dormir et retrouver le plus vite une activité économique productive.  En plus de la capacité limitée de porter ces biens lors d’un mouvement de population, dans les situations de crise avec violence ainsi que les catastrophes naturelles, la perte/destruction/pillage des biens (articles ménagers, vivres, et bien productifs) sont aussi fréquents. Ceci pourra aussi aboutir à l’aggravation de la vulnérabilité des ménages et diminuer leurs capacités à faire face à leurs besoins immédiats ainsi qu‘aux chocs futurs.  

Un autre facteur qui encouragera une coordination et collaboration entre les deux secteurs est le fait que ces deux domaines ont une unité d’intervention commune : le « ménage » ou la « famille ». Par conséquent, il y a plusieurs aspects qui se ressemblent dans les pratiques de la mise en œuvre des programmes : l’analyse des besoins, les stratégies de ciblage, les aspects logistiques liés aux activités, l’accès humanitaire, la prise en compte des enjeux de la protection et du genre—innocuité, redevabilité envers les ménages bénéficiaires - l’utilisation des approches monétaires5 et coupons, ainsi que les stratégies de suivi et évaluation. 

D’ailleurs de plus en plus les acteurs humanitaires en RDC sortent des ‘silos’ sectoriels d’Assistance
Alimentaire/SECAL et AME en apportant un appui multisectoriel aux ménages vulnérables. Il est
important que nos deux secteurs soient en mesure d’encourager cette collaboration et par
conséquent de proposer un cadre pour cette coordination—pour assurer que le maximum des
ménages affectés et dans le besoin trouvent l’accès ET à la ‘casserole’ (AME/NFI) ET aux
‘haricots’ (SECAL). L’expérience montre que dans des urgences complexes, les réponses
conjointes et/ou simultanées en AME et SECAL sont susceptibles de contribuer à une amélioration
de la sécurité alimentaire et la qualité de vie des ménages.

En vue de la complémentarité entre les deux domaines, la présente note d’orientation a été élaborée
conjointement par les Clusters AME/’NFI’ et Abris et SECAL en RDC avec le but de déterminer les
sujets d'intérêt commun et les activités sur lesquels les acteurs s’engagent à collaborer
concrètement. Les Clusters espèrent également encourager une réflexion au niveau des Clusters
Globaux sur la collaboration intersectorielle et son impact sur l’assistance humanitaire.",268,"French"

La situation humanitaire continue de se dégrader dans le nord et le centre du pays suite à l’insécurité persistance, les affrontements entre groupes armés et forces de défense/sécurité, ainsi que les conflits et tensions intercommunautaires, entrainant des déplacements de populations à l’intérieur du pays. L'insécurité ambiante affecte aussi négativement les moyens de subsistance des ménages et limite leur accès aux services sociaux de base. Près de 4,1 millions de personnes présentent un besoin en aide alimentaire dont 795 000 personnes en phase sévère.",268,"French"
2383754,"Bilan 2017 des journalistes tués, détenus, otages et disparus dans le monde **Bilan de RSF : les chiffres restent alarmants**

Reporters sans frontières (RSF) publie son bilan annuel des exactions commises contre les journalistes dans le monde. En 2017, 65 journalistes ont été tués, 326 sont actuellement en détention et 54 sont retenus comme otages.

Le bilan RSF 2017 des exactions commises contre les journalistes établit que 65 d’entre eux ont  été tués, soit dans l’exercice de leurs fonctions*, victimes par exemple d’un bombardement, soit assassinés parce que leurs enquêtes dérangeaient. Les reporters assassinés représentent d’ailleurs la part la plus importante de ces statistiques, soit 60%.

Ces chiffres restent alarmants. L’année 2017 est néanmoins la moins meurtrière pour les journalistes professionnels (50) depuis 14 ans. Depuis 2012, la baisse est même constante. Certes, ces derniers fuient des pays devenus trop dangereux, comme la Syrie, le Yémen ou la Libye… Mais RSF observe une plus grande prise de conscience des enjeux de protection des journalistes. Depuis 2006, plusieurs résolutions sur ce thème ont été votées à l’ONU et des procédures de sécurité mises en place dans de nombreuses rédactions.

Cette baisse ne s’applique pas aux femmes journalistes tuées dont le nombre a doublé en un an : dix sont mortes, contre cinq en 2016. La plupart d’entre elles avaient en commun d’être des journalistes d’investigation chevronnées et pugnaces. Malgré les menaces, elles continuaient à enquêter, à révéler des cas de corruption, d’extrémisme violent ou de trafic de drogue comme le faisaient, Daphne Caruana Galizia à Malte, Gauri Lankesh en Inde ou Miroslava Breach Velducea au Mexique.

Autre tendance notable de l’année 2017, certains pays en paix deviennent presque aussi dangereux pour les journalistes que les zones de guerre : 46% des reporters tués l’ont été dans des pays où il n’y a pas de conflits déclarés, contre 30% en 2016. Le Mexique affiche désormais presque autant de morts (11) que la Syrie, pays le plus meurtrier pour les reporters (12 tués).

“Les journalistes d’investigation qui travaillent sur de grands sujets tels que la corruption ou les scandales environnementaux jouent un rôle fondamental de contre-pouvoir et sont en cela lâchement assassinés par ceux que ces enquêtes dérangent, déplore Christophe Deloire, secrétaire général de RSF. Mener des enquêtes dans certains pays en paix est en train de devenir aussi dangereux que de couvrir un conflit. Cette situation alarmante rappelle la nécessité de davantage protéger les journalistes.

Au 1er décembre 2017, 326 journalistes se trouvaient derrière les barreaux pour avoir exercé leur profession. Comme pour la catégorie des tués, le nombre de détenus est moins important cette année (-6%). Bien que la tendance générale soit à la baisse, certains pays se démarquent pourtant par un nombre inhabituel de journalistes prisonniers. C’est le cas par exemple de la Russie et du Maroc. Pour autant, près de la moitié des journalistes détenus à travers le monde continuent de l’être dans seulement cinq pays. La Chine et la Turquie sont toujours les plus grandes prisons de journalistes au monde, suivies par la Syrie, l'Iran et le Vietnam.

Enfin, 54 journalistes sont actuellement aux mains de groupes armés non étatiques, comme le groupe Etat islamique ou les Houthis au Yémen. Près de trois quarts des otages sont des journalistes locaux, qui travaillent souvent dans des conditions précaires et risquées. Les journalistes étrangers otages à ce jour ont tous été enlevés en Syrie, sans que l’on soit en mesure de déterminer où ils se trouvent actuellement.",268,"French"
2383709,"La « localisation de l’aide » dans la réponse à l’ouragan Mathieu en Haïti **Résumé exécutif**

La localisation de l’aide en tant que concept est encore peu utilisée en Haïti, et plutôt connue des acteurs internationaux. Pourtant, la question du rôle et de la place des acteurs haïtiens dans la réponse au cyclone Mathieu a suscité un très large intérêt dans un contexte caractérisé par : 1) une volonté forte et une légitimité incontestée de l’État dans le cadre d’une réponse à une catastrophe naturelle récurrente en Haïti, 2) les traumatismes et leçons apprises de la réponse au tremblement de terre de 2010 qui avait largement marginalisé les acteurs haïtiens, 3.) des élections qui ont provoqué une politisation de l’aide et un renouvellement important des responsables politiques aux niveaux national et local. La méfiance des autorités à l’égard des acteurs internationaux associée à ce calendrier électoral particulier explique, pour l’essentiel, le refus du gouvernement de déclarer l’état d’urgence.

En revanche, la localisation de l’aide en tant que processus consistant à renforcer le rôle des acteurs haïtiens et à les replacer au centre de la réponse est bel et bien à l’œuvre en Haïti. Elle vise avant tout les acteurs publics de la gestion des risques et des désastres (GRD) structurés autour d’un maillage institutionnel complexe. La Direction de la Protection Civile, « colonne vertébrale » du Système National de GRD, repose largement sur le soutien de différents partenaires internationaux. Les efforts collectifs et systémiques de préparation ont été fructueux et démontrent une volonté réelle et partagée de replacer l’État au centre de la réponse. En outre, on observe cette même dynamique dans le dispositif de coordination auquel les ministères prennent notamment part en tant que co-directeurs des groupes de travail sectoriels. Cependant, malgré un positionnement central de l’État et un rôle technique incontesté de la DPC, les capacités de ces institutions (à commencer par les moyens opérationnels dont elles disposent) restent limitées. Les difficultés d’articulations entre les différentes autorités publiques - centrales, déconcentrées et décentralisées – représentent également un frein majeur pour une plus grande localisation de l’aide auprès de l’État haïtien. Enfin, la logique concurrentielle et les mécanismes de mobilisation des financements maintiennent un système de forte dépendance des acteurs haïtiens (dont l’État) envers les acteurs internationaux et de faible redevabilité de ces derniers vis-à-vis des premiers. Si la place des institutions publiques est centrale, leur rôle effectif et leur pouvoir de décision dans la réponse restent encore limités. Par ailleurs, la localisation de l’aide est encore très « centralisée » malgré des efforts pour coordonner la réponse à l’échelle départementale.  
Les autorités locales, notamment les municipalités, sont souvent encore souvent à la marge des interventions et prennent peu part aux discussions et aux décisions stratégiques qui concernent leurs territoires.

La localisation est un processus collectif qui vise un changement systémique mais elle se construit également sur des partenariats spécifiques entre acteurs, et notamment entre acteurs internationaux et organisations de la société civile haïtienne. Trois principaux enseignements ressortent de l’analyse de ces partenariats. Premièrement, et contrairement à d’autres contextes de crises, les revendications des OSC haïtiennes portent relativement peu sur l’obtention de financements directs (encore trop souvent jugés hors de portée), mais plutôt sur la nature et la qualité des partenariats entre acteurs.  

Ainsi, parmi les nombreuses collaborations qui ont été rapportées et qui sont souvent associées au processus de localisation, beaucoup étaient ponctuelles et relativement courtes dans le cadre de la phase d’urgence et des distributions réalisées lors des premières semaines ou des projets spécifiques de réponse à l’urgence. Ces collaborations représentent une avancée dans la capacité à travailler ensemble des acteurs internationaux et des OSC haïtiennes. Elles illustrent de plus le fait que localiser la réponse peut représenter un gain important en termes d’efficacité, d’accès aux populations, de pertinence et même d’efficience, sans pour autant contribuer à renforcer le rôle ou la place de ces OSC de manière pérenne. En revanche, certains partenariats spécifiques et anciens entre des organisations internationales et des OSC haïtiennes s’appuyant sur une vision et des valeurs communes permettent d’aller plus loin dans ce processus de localisation et notamment de mettre en œuvre une réponse « localement dirigée ». Ces partenariats se caractérisent par un partage équilibré du pouvoir de décision entre acteurs et une démarche communautaire inclusive qui favorise et soutient l’action collective et les solidarités locales tout en responsabilisant les pouvoirs publics. Grâce aux fonds propres dont disposent généralement les partenaires internationaux, on observe également une grande flexibilité dans les modalités de mise en œuvre. Les réponses proposées sont souvent innovantes et porteuses d’améliorations durables. Enfin, l’importance et les modalités du renforcement des capacités du partenaire haïtien sont essentielles dans ces démarches tant pour le renforcement du rôle de cet acteur que pour la construction d’une véritable relation de confiance entre partenaires.

La vision largement partagée parmi les acteurs de la réponse à Mathieu, selon laquelle la localisation est un catalyseur de la résilience, s’appuie sur différents éléments plus ou moins consensuels. Par ailleurs, la localisation comme vecteur de préparation aux crises fait quasiment l’unanimité en ce qu’elle contribue au renforcement des capacités de préparation et de réponse des acteurs haïtiens qui sont et resteront les premiers à intervenir en cas de cyclones. L’analyse selon laquelle la localisation favoriserait le relèvement est elle aussi relativement répandue. Cependant, elle soulève des interrogations sur les évolutions opérationnelles et stratégiques que la localisation implique et les nuances de ce que l’on « entend par » et ce que l’on « attend de » la localisation dans les différentes phases d’une réponse. La recherche d’un impact positif à long terme est, quant à elle, à la fois généralisée et clairement divergente selon les acteurs.

Elle met ainsi en évidence l’enjeu de l’articulation entre humanitaire et développement mais aussi l’influence potentielle du processus de localisation sur cette articulation.  
La localisation de l’aide est un processus multiforme à l’œuvre en Haïti. Les initiatives locales mais aussi la manière dont les solidarités locale, nationale et internationale ont pu s’associer et se soutenir mutuellement sont porteuses d’espoir et d’opportunités pour l’avenir. Malheureusement les démarches les plus innovantes sont très peu documentées et rarement évaluées. Cette faible capitalisation semble être due : 1) au peu de structuration et de capacités de capitalisation de certains acteurs locaux, 2) au manque de temps et de disponibilité des différents acteurs de l’aide pour un tel exercice, mais aussi 3) aux réticences des acteurs à échanger sur les difficultés rencontrées ou simplement sur les approches moins conventionnelles mises en œuvre, y compris en interne, lorsque celles-ci ont suscité des débats. A cela vient s’ajouter la difficulté à évaluer l’impact réel de certains modes opératoires isolés mais plus ambitieux en termes de localisation, et donc la difficulté à les promouvoir pour les prochaines réponses. Au-delà des limites et des risques de chacune de ces approches, le manque de capitalisation dans cette réponse constitue un frein majeur pour la localisation des prochaines réponses et le renforcement de la résilience locale. Résilience et localisation sont en effet des processus qui s’inscrivent dans le temps long et doivent être mis en œuvre avant, pendant mais aussi après et entre des épisodes de crises",268,"French"

Au cours de la période du 11 au 16 décembre 2017, 81 ménages volontaires des blocs 4 et 5 ont été relocalisés par des acteurs humanitaires. Ces ménages ont reçu de ces acteurs des kits NFI et un appui financier. L’évolution positive du processus laisse espérer la reprise des vol UNHAS, suspendu depuis le mois de septembre passé suite au risque d’accident lié au regroupement des PDIs autour de la piste. Par rapport à l’appui au retour pour les ménages qui décident de regagner leurs résidences, un acteur humanitaire est à pied d’œuvre pour la reconstruction de 10 maisons dans certains quartiers de Kaga-Bandoro. Cet appui s’inscrit dans le cadre d’un projet financé par OFDA qui consiste à reconstruire 88 maisons et réhabiliter 262 autres dans les quartiers de la ville de Kaga-Bandoro. Sur l’axe Kaga-Bandoro-Ndometé, 300 maisons seront reconstruites ou réhabilitées sur financement du Fonds Humanitaire.  

**Sécurité alimentaire :** Le 15 décembre 2017, la FAO et trois de ses partenaires ont débuté la distribution des semences maraichères (tomates, choux, épinards, laitues) et des outils aratoires (arrosoirs, pelles, marchettes) à 3 000 ménages dans la Nana-Gribizi, dont 600 ménages à Mbrès. La récente recrudescence des actes de braquage dans la zone restreignent les mouvements des partenaires sur les axes, retardant ainsi la distribution des semences dans certains villages.

Des sensibilisations à l’hygiène ont été également organisées. Les travaux de réparation des 12 autres forages se poursuivent. Il est également prévu le démarrage des travaux de réhabilitation du système d’approvisionnement des sites à partir de janvier 2018.  
Depuis le retrait des acteurs humanitaires en septembre 2017, plusieurs points d’eau sont tombés en panne limitant l’accès à l’eau potable des retournés et des PDIs sur les sites.

2383129,"République Centrafricaine (RCA) Concept des Opérations, Décembre 2017 **Contexte humanitaire**

En décembre 2013, la République centrafricaine a connu une des crises les plus graves de son histoire avec un impact sévère sur la situation humanitaire et les capacités du pays. Trois ans plus tard, la tenue d’élections législatives et présidentielles et la mise en place d’institutions démocratiques nationales a suscité de grands espoirs, laissant entrevoir une sortie de crise et un retour de la paix dans le pays.

Cependant, la récente recrudescence de la violence dans plusieurs localités du pays (Est, Sud et Ouest) a rappelé la problématique pluridimensionnelle des défis auxquels la République centrafricaine doit faire face pour résoudre la crise qui la traverse.

Ce contexte particulièrement complexe a conduit à une réflexion profonde sur les priorités de la stratégie humanitaire sur le moyen et long terme. En effet, du fait de la faible présence de l’Etat dans certaines parties du territoire, l’accès aux services sociaux de base continue d’être assuré en grande partie par les acteurs humanitaires.

Ainsi, près de la moitié de la population centrafricaine dépend de l’aide humanitaire pour vivre : plus de 2,2 millions de personnes ont besoin d’assistance humanitaire en matière de sécurité alimentaire, d’accès à l’eau potable et aux structures d’hygiène ou encore pour l’éducation.

Dans ce contexte critique et ancré, la réponse humanitaire reste encore largement sous financée. Le Plan de Réponse Humanitaire présenté par les Nations Unies et les organisations partenaires pour l’année 2017 qui vise à apporter une assistance humanitaire d’urgence aux 1,6 million de personnes les plus vulnérables dans le pays, évalué à 399, 5 millions de dollars n’est, à ce jour, financé qu’à hauteur de 16%",268,"French"

La société civile redouterait le risque que l'armée ougandaise s'installe dans cette partie du pays, a affirmé le président de société civile  Gilbert Kambale.

Selon lui le plus important est de mettre fin à ce groupe armé qui endeuille régulièrement la population de Beni et qui serait responsable de la mort de 14 casques bleus dans une attaque menée le 7 décembre dernier.

«Nous tenons à saluer ce projet parce que nous estimons que cette guerre est en train de s'enliser. C'est une autre action entre deux armées. Notre souci, c'est d'abord obtenir un résultat qui sera concret et qui mettra fin à cette situation.

« Cette nouvelle loi devra être basée sur le respect de la dignité de la personne, en conformité avec les principaux instruments internationaux relatifs aux droits humains », recommande le Sjm/Sfw-Haïti, dans un communiqué transmis à l’agence en ligne AlterPresse.

Il souligne combien cette loi migratoire est urgente au vu du taux croissant d’émigration de la population haïtienne et de la diversification de ses flux migratoires.

Il appelle tous les secteurs de la société haïtienne ainsi que la communauté internationale « à s’engager pour exiger cette nouvelle loi migratoire pour le respect et la dignité des migrantes et migrants haïtiens ».

« Face aux nombreux défis liés au phénomène migratoire, la population a besoin d’être protégée. Les ressortissantes et ressortissants haïtiens ont le droit de pouvoir migrer en toute sécurité ».

Certains textes datant de l’époque du régime des Duvalier (1957-1986), toujours en vigueur aujourd’hui, ne correspondent plus au contexte actuel. Ils ne permettent pas de protéger les droits des migrantes et migrants haïtiens confrontés à une autre réalité et à de nouveaux défis, signale le Sjm/Sfw-Haïti.

Il critique le fait qu’en Haïti, le droit à la documentation n’est pas garanti pour l’ensemble de la population.

« Un important pourcentage de la population n’est pas doté de son acte de naissance. Sans ce document, il est impossible d’obtenir des documents d’identité et de voyage tels qu’un passeport qui permet à la population de voyager en plus de sécurité ».

L’organisme de défense des droits des migrants déplore également le manque d’accompagnement des autorités étatiques haïtiennes aux ressortissants haïtiens vivant à l’étranger, et en particulier en République Dominicaine, notamment dans l’obtention de leurs papiers d’identité.

Ce qui peut considérablement augmenter leur vulnérabilité sur le territoire étranger, met en garde le Service jésuite aux migrants/Solidarite fwontalye-Haïti, évoquant l’échec cuisant du Programme d’identification et de documentation des immigrants haïtiens (Pidih) mis en œuvre par l’Etat haïtien en République Dominicaine en juillet 2014.

De juin 2015 à fin novembre 2017, 102, 740 personnes dont de nombreux enfants expulsées du pays voisin ont été accueilli dans les bureaux respectifs du Sjm/Sfw-Haïti, en conséquence de cet échec.

« Ces chiffres ne prennent en compte ni les cas de refoulement ni les retours spontanés des personnes ayant fui des persécutions ou parties avant d’être expulsées », précise-t-il.

Il fustige l’absence de tout encadrement étatique pour faciliter la réinsertion dans la société haïtienne des migrantes et migrants, de retour sur le territoire haïtien, après avoir vécu à l’étranger.

Il exhorte les autorités à donner un accompagnement à ces personnes, spécialement, celles qui ont pu souffrir de violences physiques, psychologiques ou sexuelles après avoir été expulsées.

Il encourage les autorités haïtiennes à ratifier la convention internationale sur la protection des droits de tous les travailleurs migrants et des membres de leurs familles, signée par l’Etat haïtien le 5 décembre 2013.

Cette convention internationale a été adoptée par l’Organisation des Nations Unies (Onu), le 18 décembre 1990, date consacrée journée internationale des migrantes et migrants.

L’existence d’un instrument légal en Haïti protégeant les droits des migrantes et migrants est aujourd’hui encore plus que nécessaire, dans un contexte où ces derniers font l’objet de violations constantes, avance le le Sjm/Sfw-Haïti. [emb gp apr 18/12/2017 10 :55]",268,"French"

La ratification de la convention donnera un argument de plus aux organisations de droits humains, qui accompagnent les personnes migrantes, dans les actions de plaidoyer auprès des États qui reçoivent des migrantes et migrants haïtiens, notamment la République Dominicaine, estime Géralda Sainville, responsable de communication et de plaidoyer à la plateforme Garr.

Cet appel a été lancé lors d’une conférence de presse, le vendredi 15 décembre 2017, à laquelle a assisté l’agence en ligne AlterPresse.

Adoptée par l’Assemblée générale de l’Organisation des Nations unies (Onu) le 18 décembre 1990, dans sa résolution 45/158, cette convention internationale sur la protection des droits des migrantes et migrants, une fois ratifiée par le parlement haïtien, devrait permettre d’avoir un cadre juridique pour analyser et orienter la politique migratoire d’Haïti..

Cette ratification de la conventio ninternationale sur la protection des droits des migrantes et migrants, déjà signée, par Haïti, en décembre 2013, rendra effective la volonté d’avoir un cadre protecteur en faveur des migrantes et migrants, souligne la plateforme Garr, dans une lettre ouverte adressée au parlement.

« Aujourd’hui, Haïti est un pays d’émigrantes et d’émigrants. Mis à part les déplacements internes de population, en constante évolution pour de multiples raisons, l’émigration haïtienne prend une ampleur surprenante. Une bonne partie de la population vit à l’extérieur, les estimations se chiffrent à plus de trois millions d’Haïtiennes et d’Haïtiens ».

Elle déplore la situation de ressortissantes et ressortissants d’Haïti, qui se retrouvent dans des pays d’accueil, où le racisme et la xénophobie sont très marqués et se traduisent en des actes d’abus, de cruauté et de discrimination.

« Les femmes et les enfants sont encore plus exposés dans les mouvements migratoires, non seulement parce qu’ils sont des étrangers, mais aussi à cause de leur sexe ou de leur âge ».

Quoiqu’en nombre inférieur par rapport aux hommes, ces deux groupes ont vécu des expériences, qui affectent, à jamais, leur corps et leur esprit, condamne la plateforme Garr.

De début janvier au 13 décembre 2017, 31 cas emblématiques de violations, dont 7 cas d’assassinats et 24 autres liés à des sévices corporels ont été signalés à l’encontre des migrantes et migrants haïtiens, en République Dominicaine, au Brésil et au Chili.

« La Convention (internationale sur la protection des droits des migrantes et migrants) de 1990 fournit un cadre juridique international, qui permet d’analyser et d’orienter les politiques migratoires. Avec un tel instrument, l’Etat haïtien pourra entreprendre des pourparlers avec ses homologues étrangers pour d’éventuelles coopérations », fait valoir l’organisme de promotion et de défense des droits des migrantes et migrants.

Les autorités seront également en mesure d’établir, de manière proactive, des accords bilatéraux, en matière de migration de travail, et de prévenir d’autres phénomènes, tels que la migration irrégulière, le trafic et la traite de personnes.

La ratification de la convention internationale sur la protection des droits des migrantes et migrants facilitera aussi la garantie des mesures de protection, en faveur des immigrantes et immigrants qui sont sur le territoire national en Haïti.

2382394,"La solidarité avec les migrants est une question d'urgence, souligne l'ONU 18 décembre 2017 – A l'occasion de la Journée internationale des migrants (18 décembre), les Nations Unies exhortent les Etats à davantage de coopération internationale pour rendre les migrations plus sûres de sorte que les bénéfices qu'elles apportent soient plus largement répartis et que les droits fondamentaux de toutes les personnes concernées soient protégés.

« Les preuves ne manquent pas pour montrer que les migrants produisent des avantages économiques, sociaux et culturels pour toutes les sociétés », a déclaré le [Secrétaire général](http://www.un.org/sg/fr)de l'ONU, António Guterres dans un message publié lors de la Journée. « L'occasion pour nous de reconnaître les contributions qu'apportent les 258 millions de migrants de par le monde et d'en célébrer la vitalité », a-t-il ajouté.

« Et pourtant, l'hostilité envers les migrants ne fait, hélas, que croître à travers le monde », a déploré M. Guterres qui fut pendant 10 ans Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés. « Il est, plus que jamais, urgent de faire preuve de solidarité avec les migrants », a souligné le chef de l'ONU.

Pour l'Organisation internationale pour les migrations, deux réalités co-existantes et radicalement divergentes s'affrontent sur la même planète et rendent imprévisibles - voir même volatiles - les politiques jusqu'ici somnolentes de nombreux pays.

« Alors que nous vivons une époque dans laquelle une élite privilégiée considère la mobilité mondiale presque comme un droit de naissance, de nombreuses autres personnes prises au piège dans des situations économiques dramatiques ou des conflits se voient privées de ce droit. », a pour sa part déclaré William Lacy Swing, le Directeur général de l'[OIM](http://www.iom.int/fr).

« Des centaines de millions de personnes qui ne sont pas compétitives sur le marché du travail de plus en plus mondialisé doivent regarder de l'extérieur un monde dont elles ne peuvent que rêver », a rappelé M. Swing. « Elles font face à de grandes difficultés et inégalités de revenu et n'ont aucune chance d'obtenir un visa ou un permis de travail ».

Pour le Directeur général de l'OIM, il n'est pas donc étonnant de voir d'immenses vagues de « jeunes migrants pleins d'espoir » embarquer à bord de « bateaux qui prennent l'eau ».

« C'est là où les réseaux de passeurs, les trafiquants et les esclavagistes modernes entrent en jeu pour se livrer à leur commerce en toute impunité. Ces tromperies cruelles restent impunies alors que les géants des médias sociaux partent à la conquête de nouveaux marchés dans les pays du Sud », a dénoncé. M. Swing.

Le Secrétaire général de l'ONU a de nouveau rappelé une évidence : les migrations ont toujours existé et ne sont pas prêtes à disparaître du monde.

« Depuis les temps immémoriaux, les êtres humains se sont déplacés, en quête de nouveaux débouchés et d'une vie meilleure », a dit M. Guterres. « Les migrations continueront d'exister, à cause des changements climatiques, de l'évolution démographique, de l'instabilité, de l'aggravation des inégalités, des besoins des marchés du travail et de la recherche de meilleures conditions de vie.

En septembre 2016, les dirigeants mondiaux se sont engagés à conclure un Pacte mondial pour des migrations sûres, ordonnées et régulières à l'horizon 2018. Les Nations Unies appellent à œuvrer à la réalisation de cet « objectif pour tous ».",268,"French"
2382379,"Les casques bleus de la MINUSMA repoussent 4 attaques à Kidal *Bamako, le 16 décembre 2017*

Hier soir vers 19 heures, les Casques bleus de la MINUSMA ont repoussé 4 attaques à Kidal.

Une patrouille de la MINUSMA a d'abord été la cible de tirs nourris par des hommes armés non identifiés dans la ville de Kidal. Deux Casques bleus ont été blessés, dont un sérieusement, lors des échanges de tirs.

Peu de temps après, deux postes de la MINUSMA situés autour de la ville étaient la cible de tirs, auxquels les Casques bleus ont immédiatement et vigoureusement riposté. Simultanément la Force de la MINUSMA repoussait une attaque sur son camp avec succès, alors que les mesures appropriées étaient prises pour la protection du camp et du personnel.

Le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général et Chef de la MINUSMA, M. Annadif condamne fermement ces attaques contre les soldats de la paix qui mettent en péril la population de la ville, et met en garde les assaillants :

""Hier, la paix a une fois de plus été la cible d'assaillants lourdement armés à Kidal, je le condamne fermement. Ces actions expriment clairement une volonté délibérée de mettre les populations en danger. Je mets en garde ces semeurs de chaos qui se heurteront, comme aujourd'hui et toujours, à une réponse vigoureuse des Casques bleus, dont je salue la détermination. Il est totalement inadmissible que le personnel de la MINUSMA soit la victime de telles entreprises destructrices organisées par des individus misérables et désœuvrés qui mettent également en péril la population de Kidal. Trois civils ont malheureusement été légèrement blessés lors des échanges, et nous le déplorons. Les dispositions médicales ont été immédiatement prises par la MINUSMA. Je souhaite aux civils, et à nos Casques bleus, un rétablissement rapide et complet.""",268,"French"

Débuté il y a trois mois, l’ouvrage a été remis jeudi aux bénéficiaires et aux autorités.**

Le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR) en étroite collaboration avec la Direction nationale de l’hydraulique (DRH) et l’Office national des services d’eau en milieu rural (ONSER) a financé et conduit ces travaux.

«A travers ce projet, nous contribuons à améliorer l’accès à l’eau dans une région qui doit faire face à des besoins accrus en services publics en raison de la présence de réfugiés du conflit armé qui touche le Mali voisin», explique Rachel Bernhard, cheffe de la délégation du CICR en Mauritanie.

Le projet a consisté à rétablir trois unités de production (forages), à renforcer le réseau hydraulique existant, à réaliser une source d’énergie solaire de 34 panneaux pour un premier forage et à donner un groupe électrogène pour pallier les coupures d’électricité.  « Ces divers travaux ont permis de viabiliser le réseau d’approvisionnement d’eau et de stabiliser la production estimée à 176 0000 litres de volume d’eau additionnelle pour le premier forage et à 638 000 litres par jour pour deux autres forages»,  précise Doudou Fofana, qui a conduit les travaux pour le CICR.

Par ailleurs, en mars dernier, le CICR a terminé des travaux sur le réseau hydraulique de Bassikounou bénéficiant à environ 7 000 personnes. Ces travaux réalisés en partenariat avec la Société nationale des eaux (SNDE) ont consisté notamment en la réalisation d’un nouveau forage, la fourniture et l’installation d’un groupe électrogène et la réhabilitation d’un local technique. Ces travaux bénéficient à environ 7’000 personnes.

Dans la commune de Fassala, quelques 1 250 habitants des villages de Kervi, El koweïti, Daoudi, Sondage, Ishteye et Sérédouba dans Fassala ont été sensibilisés aux bonnes pratiques d'hygiène et à la gestion de l'eau par des volontaires du Croissant-Rouge mauritanien. Ces derniers avaient été formés par le CICR lors d’un cours de promotion de l’hygiène en milieu rural et semi-urbain.

En Mauritanie, le CICR s’emploie principalement à améliorer le sort des détenus et à venir en aide aux réfugiés du Mali et populations du sud-est affectées par le conflit au Mali. Le CICR promeut le droit international humanitaire et aide le Croissant-Rouge mauritanien à se préparer aux situations d’urgence.

2382364,"Dans une installation au Liban, un incendie brise la vie d’une famille de réfugiés syriens Par Scott Craig 

PLAINE DE LA BEKAA, Liban - Huit enfants syriens ont trouvé la mort la semaine dernière dans un incendie qui a ravagé le labyrinthe de tentes en bois et en plastique d’un campement informel de réfugiés, une tragédie qui vient encore rappeler la précarité de l’existence des réfugiés en exil.  
L’incendie a éclaté le 7 décembre à Ghazze, un village situé à une quarantaine de kilomètres à l’est de la capitale, Beyrouth. Attisé par les vents forts, il s’est propagé en quelques minutes à travers tout le campement. Toutes les victimes appartenaient à la même famille élargie. « L’incendie s’est propagé si vite que rien ne pouvait l’arrêter… J’ai essayé d’aider à l’éteindre, mais nous n’y sommes pas arrivés. On ne pouvait rien faire, » raconte Abdullah, qui a perdu son fils Yaccoub, quatre ans, et sa fille Hala, deux ans, dans ce désastre.  

Les deux fils de son frère Mahmoud, Mohamad, cinq ans, et Abdullah, trois ans, ont également perdu la vie. Sa femme Maysa faisait les courses au marché quand l’incendie s’est déclaré, mais le temps qu’elle arrive au campement, il était trop tard pour les sauver.  

Plus d’un million de Syriens ont trouvé refuge au Liban. Nombre d’entre eux vivent dans des campements informels comme l’installation de Ghazze, où les familles se servent de réchauds pour cuisiner et chauffer leurs tentes.

Près des trois quarts des réfugiés syriens au Liban vivent en-dessous du seuil de pauvreté. Outre les victimes, l’incendie a également privé de logement près de 40 familles aujourd’hui totalement démunies et dévasté une communauté très soudée.  

Le beau-frère de Mahmoud, Ibrahim, était allé rendre visite à un proche dans un hôpital local lorsque les nouvelles de l’incendie lui sont parvenues. Il s’est précipité chez lui et a trouvé ses voisins — tant Syriens que Libanais — qui tentaient désespérément de lutter contre les flammes. « Il ne restait plus rien après l’incendie, pas de vêtements, pas de jouets… Rien, » dit Ibrahim qui a perdu ses deux enfants, Fatima, quatre ans, et Khalil, deux ans. « Il ne nous reste plus que des souvenirs de nos enfant. » Après l’incendie, les voisins libanais de la communauté ont offert refuge et consolation à ceux qui avaient tout perdu. « Je ne peux plus considérer les gens comme des Syriens ou des Libanais, nous sommes voisins. Parfois les gens disent que les Syriens sont une charge, mais je ne pense pas, ce sont mes amis, et mes voisins, » dit Iman, une Libanaise qui vit dans un immeuble proche. 

Cet incendie est le plus dévastateur qu’ait connu la communauté de réfugiés syriens au Liban, mais ce n’est pas le premier. À Akkar, dans le nord du pays, trois personnes dont un enfant ont péri dans les flammes juste une semaine avant l’incendie de Ghazze. En juillet, le feu a emporté un enfant à Bar Elias, là encore dans la plaine de la Bekaa. Et deux autres personnes sont mortes dans un incendie qui s’est déclaré à Jiyeh en décembre dernier.  

Mohammed Al Majzoub, le maire de Ghazze, a ouvert le stade municipal pour accueillir les réfugiés. Bien que la cause de l’incendie n’ait pas été établie, il a démarré dans une tente vide et s’est rapidement propagé dans tout le campement avant que les résidents ne puissent réagir.  
Le HCR et son partenaire Medair travaillent avec la municipalité et les autorités. Les travaux de reconstruction démarreront bientôt, une fois qu’un plan visant à augmenter l’espace entre les tentes sera approuvé par la municipalité et le propriétaire du terrain dans l’espoir de limiter les risques de pareilles catastrophes à l’avenir.  

Le HCR travaille également en étroite collaboration avec les autorités de la protection civile du Liban pour lancer conjointement une campagne de sensibilisation sur les risques d’incendie et former des réfugiés, des résidents et des pompiers à la lutte contre l’incendie.",268,"French"

18 DÉCEMBRE 2017

La Cinquième Commission chargée des questions administratives et budgétaires était saisie, ce matin, d’une demande de 93,2 millions de dollars pour financer la nouvelle Mission des Nations Unies pour l’appui à la justice en Haïti (MINUJUSTH) en 2017-18.  Comme le Comité consultatif pour les questions administratives et budgétaires (CCQAB) recommande une réduction de 1,4 million, les États d’Amérique latine et des Caraïbes ont argué des besoins réels de la Mission sur le terrain et rejeté les « plafonds budgétaires artificiels ».

[Créée](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2350(2017)) en octobre dernier par le Conseil de sécurité, après la fermeture de la Mission des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en Haïti (MINUSTAH), la MINUJUSTH a pour mandat d’aider le Gouvernement haïtien à développer la police nationale, renforcer l’état de droit et promouvoir la défense des droits de l’homme.  Prévue pour une période initiale allant du 16 octobre 2017 au 16 avril 2018, la Mission a, dans un premier temps, bénéficié d’une autorisation de dépenses préliminaire de 25 millions de dollars jusqu’au 31 décembre 2017. 

Le Secrétaire général demande 68,2 millions pour la période allant du 1er janvier au 30 juin 2018, faisant monter le budget total à 93,2 millions de dollars.  Mais le CCQAB se prononce pour une enveloppe de 91,8 millions, justifiée par le relèvement du taux de vacance du personnel de 5 à 10%; la non-création des postes de spécialistes des systèmes informatiques, de la gestion des installations et d’assistant à la gestion des états de paie; la réduction de 23 000 dollars des ressources allouées aux consultants; et celle de 10% des dépenses liées aux voyages.

De telles « réductions arbitraires sans justificatif technique » ne sont pas acceptables, a estimé la Communauté des États d’Amérique latine et des Caraïbes (CELAC), appelant les États Membres à approuver l’intégralité du budget proposé par le Secrétaire général.  Pour la CELAC, les ressources allouées à la MINUJUSTH doivent tenir compte, avant tout, non pas de « plafonds budgétaires artificiels », mais des besoins réels sur le terrain. 

Les résultats sur le terrain doivent aussi déterminer la durée du mandat de la Mission, a précisé l’Argentine, mettant en garde contre le recours à une date de retrait « prédéfinie ».  Un retrait « prématuré » des effectifs risquerait de remettre en question les « succès engrangés au cours de ces dernières années ».  Pour que la Mission soit aussi un succès, il faudra insister sur le lien entre sécurité et développement, a, à son tour, estimé le Chili qui a appelé l’ONU à lancer des projets de développement pour compléter le travail de la MINUJUSTH.  La Communauté des Caraïbes (CARICOM) a donc salué la proposition du Secrétaire général de mettre en œuvre 30 projets en faveur des institutions de justice et de sécurité haïtiennes, ainsi qu’un programme de réduction de la violence communautaire en 2018 dans le cadre de la MINUJUSTH.

Les délégations étaient aussi saisies de plusieurs autres demandes de fonds pour 2018-2019: 72,2 millions pour la Mission d’appui des Nations Unies en Libye (MANUL) en 2018, soit une augmentation de 11 millions (18%) par rapport à 2017; 1,4 million pour le futur Bureau de l’Envoyé spécial pour le Myanmar; et 357 300 dollars pour poursuivre l’enquête sur les circonstances de la mort de l’ancien Secrétaire général Dag Hammarskjöld et des personnes qui l’accompagnaient.  Sur toutes ces enveloppes, le CCQAB a recommandé des réductions.

La prochaine réunion de la Cinquième Commission sera annoncée dans le _Journal des Nations Unies_.

**_FINANCEMENT DE LA MISSION DES NATIONS UNIES POUR L’APPUI À LA JUSTICE EN HAÏTI (MINUJUSTH)_**

**Rapport du Comité consultatif pour les questions administratives et budgétaires (CCQAB) sur le budget de la MINUJUSTH** **pour la période allant du 16 octobre 2017 au 30 juin 2018 (**[**A/72/642**](http://undocs.org/fr/A/72/642)**)**

Le CCQAB rappelle d’abord que le montant brut du budget proposé pour la MINUJUSTH pour la période allant du 16 octobre 2017 au 30 juin 2018 est de 93 182 100 dollars, soit les 25 000 000 dollars autorisés par le Comité consultatif pour la période allant du 16 octobre au 31 décembre 2017 et un montant additionnel de 68 182 100 dollars pour la période allant du 1er janvier au 30 juin 2018 ([A/72/560*](http://undocs.org/fr/A/72/560)).  Le montant total des dépenses se décompose comme suit: 34 279 800 dollars pour le personnel de police, 26 834 800 dollars pour le personnel civil et 32 067 500 dollars pour les dépenses opérationnelles; les recettes provenant des contributions du personnel étant estimées à 2 483 900 dollars.

Fort de ses chiffres, le CCQAB fait des recommandations qui aboutiraient à réduire de 1 370 900 dollars l’enveloppe proposée.  Il propose ainsi qu’un taux de vacance de 10% et non de 5% soit appliqué pour le personnel recruté sur le plan international, les administrateurs recrutés sur le plan national et les agents des services généraux recrutés sur le plan national.  Il s’oppose aussi à la création d’un poste de spécialiste des systèmes informatiques (P-3) et d’un poste de spécialiste de la gestion des installations (P-3).

Le CCQAB s’oppose également à la création d’un poste d’assistant (budget et finances) (agent des services généraux recruté sur le plan national) au Bureau d’appui commun de Koweït, qui était prévu à titre provisoire.  Il recommande par ailleurs de réduire de 22 900 dollars les crédits demandés au titre des consultants chargés de la formation.  Le CCQAB recommande en outre que le total des prévisions de dépenses au titre des voyages soit réduit de 10%.

Selon le CCQAB, l’Assemblée générale devrait donc ouvrir de 91 811 200 dollars pour la période de huit mois et demi allant du 16 octobre 2017 au 30 juin 2018, dont le montant de 25 000 000 dollars précédemment autorisé pour la période allant du 16 octobre au 31 décembre 2017.

**Déclarations**

Au nom de la Communauté des États d’Amérique latine et des Caraïbes (CELAC), M. CARLOS ALEJANDRO FUNES HENRÍQUEZ (El Salvador) a plaidé pour que la MINUJUSTH soit dotée des ressources nécessaires à l’exécution de son mandat, y compris aider le Gouvernement haïtien à renforcer l’état de droit, développer la police nationale et faire respecter les droits de l’homme.  Ces tâches, a-t-il souligné, justifient bien une « présence permanente des Nations Unies et de la communauté internationale ».  Le représentant s’est donc opposé à toute « réduction arbitraire sans justificatif technique » des ressources à allouer à la Mission.  L’allocation des ressources doit avant tout tenir compte des besoins réels sur le terrain et pas « de plafonds budgétaires artificiels ».

Au nom de la Communauté des Caraïbes (CARICOM), Mme DIEDRE NICHOLE MILLS (Jamaïque) a salué la proposition du Secrétaire général de mettre en œuvre 30 projets à impact rapide en faveur des institutions de justice et de sécurité, dont les commissariats de police et les tribunaux.  Elle a insisté pour que ces projets d’infrastructures soient conformes aux normes internationales.  La représentante a insisté sur l’importance du programme de réduction de la violence communautaire et a dit compter que le Secrétaire général prendra les mesures nécessaires pour mener à bien ces programmes en 2018.  À son tour, la représentante a souligné que les budgets des missions de maintien de la paix et des missions politiques spéciales devraient être basés sur la situation sur le terrain et sur le mandat approuvé par le Conseil de sécurité et non sur « des plafonds budgétaires artificiels ».   Elle s’est donc opposée à « toute réduction arbitraire sans justification technique ».

M. JUAN SANDOVAL MENDIOLEA (Mexique) a rappelé que la MINUJUSTH sera appelée à contribuer au renforcement des institutions publiques d’Haïti, à la protection des droits de l’homme et au développement des forces de police nationales.  Cette mission, a-t-il estimé, devrait démontrer la capacité des Nation Unies à promouvoir une paix durable, dans la perspective de la mise en œuvre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030.  Il a plaidé pour que la Mission soit dotée des ressources nécessaires et a renouvelé l’intention de son pays de participer activement au travail de la MINUJUSTH, notamment en y déployant des effectifs.

Mme MARÍA DEL CARMEN DOMÍNGUEZ (Chili) a déclaré que, dans ce nouveau cycle, le lien entre sécurité et développement continuera d’être « fondamental » pour parvenir à une paix durable.  Pour appuyer le mandat de la Mission, il faudra donc lancer des projets de développement, a poursuivi la représentante, en rappelant la Cinquième Commission à sa responsabilité de doter la Mission des ressources demandées par le Secrétaire général pour que cette dernière soit une continuité et non un recul.  La prise en compte de la situation sur le terrain est « essentielle », a insisté la représentante.

Mme NATALIA VIRGINIA BABIO (Argentine) a salué les progrès réalisés en Haïti depuis la fin de la Mission des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en Haïti (MINUSTAH) et la création de la MINUJUSTH.  S’agissant de la durée du mandat de la nouvelle Mission, la représentante a voulu que l’on « évite un retrait prématuré susceptible de remettre en question les succès engrangés au cours de ces dernières années ».  À ses yeux, le retrait de la MINUJUSTH devra être déterminé en fonction des « résultats sur le terrain » plutôt que d’une « date prédéfinie ».  Pour ce qui est du financement, la représentante s’est dite prête, durant les négociations, à faire en sorte que la MINUJUSTH dispose de « toutes les ressources nécessaires » pour s’acquitter de son mandat.  Elle a ainsi appelé les États Membres à approuver le montant des ressources demandées par le Secrétaire général.

M. OLIVIO FERMÍN (République dominicaine) a déclaré qu’après plus d’une décennie avec la MINUSTAH, Haïti bénéficiait d’une plus grande stabilité politique.  Le pays a prouvé qu’il est prêt à faire tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour renforcer cette stabilité, comme en témoignent les réformes menées par son Président dans son programme « Caravane pour le changement ».  Soulignant le soutien de la République dominicaine à Haïti, le représentant a appuyé le niveau de financement proposé par le Secrétaire général, y compris celui des projets à impact rapide.

PROJET DE BUDGET-PROGRAMME POUR L’EXERICE BIENNAL 2018-2018

Rapport du Comité consultatif pour les questions administratives et budgétaires sur les incidences sur le budget-programme du projet de résolution A/C.3/72/L.48) relatif à la situation des droits de l’homme au Myanmar (A/72/7/Add.33)

Le Comité consultatif rappelle qu’au paragraphe 10 du projet de résolution, l’Assemblée générale prierait le Secrétaire général de nommer un Envoyé spécial pour le Myanmar, ce qui renvoie au programme 2 (Affaires politiques) du plan-programme biennal et aux priorités arrêtées pour l’exercice 2018-2019.

Les ressources nécessaires pour le Bureau de l’Envoyé spécial pour 2018 s’élèvent à 1 541 100 dollars, couvrant la création de sept postes (1 poste de secrétaire général adjoint, 1 D-1, 2 P-5, 2 P-4, 1 poste d’agent local) et d’autres dépenses opérationnelles.

Le Comité consultatif recommande que les prévisions de dépenses pour le personnel de terrain et les dépenses opérationnelles correspondantes en 2018 soient recalculées sur la base des taux standard appliqués à Bangkok, du fait de sa proximité avec le Myanmar et de la forte présence locale de l’ONU, l’emplacement du Bureau restant à déterminer.

Le Comité consultatif réitère aussi sa recommandation tendant à ce que, à l’exception du poste de secrétaire général adjoint, des taux de vacance de 50% et 35% soient appliqués, respectivement, pour les administrateurs et fonctionnaires de rang supérieur et pour les agents des services généraux et les catégories apparentées.  Il recommande donc de ne pas approuver à ce stade la création d’un poste de spécialiste hors classe des questions politiques (P-5) et d’un poste de spécialiste des affaires politiques (P-4).  Le Comité doute par ailleurs de la nécessité de recourir aux services de deux consultants et recommande de réduire de 36 800 dollars le montant demandé au titre des services de consultants et de 5%, les ressources au titre des voyages.

Si elle adopte le projet de résolution, l’Assemblée générale devra prévoir des ressources d’un montant de 853 800 dollars (déduction faite des contributions du personnel) pour la période du 1er janvier au 31 décembre 2018 pour financer le Bureau de l’Envoyé spécial sur le Myanmar.  Ce montant serait imputé sur les crédits ouverts au titre des missions politiques spéciales, qui relèvent du chapitre 3 (Affaires politiques) du projet de budget-programme pour l’exercice biennal 2018-2019.

**Déclaration**

Mme DAW HMWAY HMWAY KHYNE (Myanmar) a souligné que son pays s’est toujours opposé à l’adoption des résolutions spécifiques, comme action contraire au principe de l’ONU qui est d’éviter les chevauchements des mandats.  La résolution dont il s’agit ici, a poursuivi la représentante, est « arbitraire, discriminatoire et motivée politiquement » et sous-tendue par « la mauvaise intention d’exercer une pression politique injustifiée » sur le Myanmar.  La représentante a ainsi rappelé qu’il existe déjà un Rapporteur spécial sur la situation des droits de l’homme au Myanmar, dont le mandat, établi en 1992 par la résolution 58 de la Commission des droits de l’homme, est renouvelé chaque année.  Le mandat vient d’ailleurs d’être élargi par le Conseil des droits de l’homme, l’année dernière.  La représentante a aussi rappelé la mission d’établissement des faits qui a été créée le 30 mai 2017 par le même Conseil. 

« Ma délégation doute donc qu’une mission politique établie sans le consentement ou la coopération du pays concerné soit à même de produire des résultats tangibles et productifs », a avoué la représentante qui a vu là un « nouveau gaspillage » des ressources limitées des Nations Unies.  L’Organisation, a-t-elle prôné, devrait plutôt se concentrer sur la lutte contre la pauvreté et sur le développement durable.

Rapport du Comité consultatif pour les questions administratives et budgétaires sur les incidences sur le budget-programme du projet de résolution A/72/L.19 relatif à l’enquête sur les conditions et les circonstances de la mort tragique de Dag Hammarskjöld et des personnes qui l’accompagnaient (A/72/7/Add.32)

Le Comité consultatif rappelle que parmi les demandes formulées dans le projet de résolution, l’Assemblée générale prierait le Secrétaire général de reconduire dans ses fonctions l’Éminente Personnalité afin qu’elle continue d’examiner d’éventuels éléments d’information nouveaux, notamment ceux émanant d’États Membres, et d’en évaluer la valeur probante, de déterminer la portée à donner à toute nouvelle enquête et, si possible, de tirer des conclusions des enquêtes déjà menées.  Les ressources nécessaires s’élèvent à 357 300 dollars pour l’exercice biennal 2018-2019.  Mais au vu des dépenses engagées en 2016-2017, et compte tenu des activités à mener, le Comité considère que le montant des crédits demandés pourrait être réduit de 10% (35 730 dollars).  Il recommande par conséquent à l’Assemblée générale d’approuver des crédits d’un montant de 321 600 dollars.

Rapport du Comité consultatif pour les questions administratives et budgétaires sur la Mission d’appui des Nations Unies en Libye (A/72/7/Add.18)

Pour l’établissement de son rapport, le Comité consultatif a examiné celui du Secrétaire général (A/72/371/Add.8) qui indique que, par sa résolution 2376 (2017), le Conseil de sécurité a prorogé le mandat de la MANUL jusqu’au 15 septembre 2018.  Le montant des ressources demandées s’élève à 72 179 100 dollars (montant net), soit une augmentation de 11 032 700 dollars, ou 18,0%, par rapport aux crédits approuvés pour 2017.  L’essentiel de cette augmentation a trait aux installations et infrastructures.

Passant en revue le tableau, le Comité consultatif doute de la nécessité de créer un poste de spécialiste hors classe des questions politiques (P-5) pour renforcer l’équipe responsable de la Libye au Département des affaires politiques.  Il recommande aussi la suppression des postes d’assistant spécialiste des questions politiques à la Division des affaires politiques (administrateur recruté sur le plan national), d’assistant protection rapprochée à la Section de la sécurité (agent local) et d’assistant (sécurité sur le terrain) à la Section de la sécurité (agent local), vacants depuis au moins deux ans.

Le Comité consultatif juge également inutile de demander des ressources supplémentaires au titre des consultants et recommande par ailleurs de revoir les dispositions contractuelles en se fondant sur les besoins de la MANUL avant l’expiration du contrat de location actuel.  Le Comité consultatif avoue aussi ne pas être convaincu de la nécessité d’acquérir du matériel informatique en sus de la dotation standard et des pièces détachées.  Il recommande une réduction d’un montant de 25 700 dollars.

**Déclaration**

M. MOHAMED A. M. NFATI (Lybie) a voulu que la Mission dispose des ressources adéquates pour s’acquitter de son mandat et a souhaité que les postes à pourvoir soient attribués en priorité aux candidats nationaux.  Le représentant a espéré le retour de la stabilité politique et sécuritaire pour que la Mission puisse retourner à Tripoli avec un effectif complet et que le Gouvernement d’entente nationale puisse avancer dans la transition politique.

Rapport du Comité consultatif pour les questions administratives et budgétaires sur le pouvoir discrétionnaire limité en matière de dépenses (A/72/7/Add.30)

Le Comité consultatif rappelle que, dans sa résolution 60/246, l’Assemblée générale s’est déclarée consciente qu’il faut que le Secrétaire général dispose d’une certaine marge de manœuvre dans l’exécution du budget.  Deux ans plus tard, l’Assemblée a décidé d’autoriser le Secrétaire général, à titre expérimental, à engager des dépenses jusqu’à concurrence de 20 millions de dollars, le montant total des dépenses pouvant être engagées par le Secrétaire général ne devrait pas dépasser 6 millions de dollars par exercice biennal; tout montant dépassant ce plafond nécessiterait l’assentiment préalable du Comité.  Ce dispositif perdure jusqu’ici et la proposition du Secrétaire général de le maintenir pour l’exercice biennal 2018-2019 reste subordonnée à la décision que l’Assemblée prendra au sujet des propositions de réforme.

Le Comité consultatif estime que le dispositif pourrait être davantage utilisé et recommande donc que l’Assemblée générale approuve son maintien.  Il note néanmoins que le fonctionnement du dispositif est entravé par un certain nombre de limitations, dont la nécessité de financer les besoins au moyen de reliquats résultant d’une sous-utilisation des crédits autorisés au titre d’autres chapitres du budget.  Le Comité recommande à l’Assemblée de supprimer la disposition faisant obligation de recenser des économies.  Si l’Assemblée décide d’approuver l’adoption d’un cycle budgétaire annuel à compter de 2020 et souscrit à sa recommandation de demander au Secrétaire général d’évaluer les pouvoirs discrétionnaires, le Comité compte voir figurer dans ladite évaluation des informations sur l’exercice biennal 2018‑2019.",268,"French"
2382129,"L'UE apportera son soutien au Niger avec une aide de 1 milliard d'euros d'ici 2020 *Commission européenne - Communiqué de presse*

Bruxelles, le 13 décembre 2017

Le montant total de l'aide au développement de l'UE en faveur du Niger s'élèvera à 1 milliard d'euros pour la période 2017-2020. C'est ce qu'a annoncé le commissaire européen en charge de la coopération internationale et du développement, Neven Mimica, lors de la table ronde des donateurs pour le Niger qui s'est tenue à Paris.

À cette occasion, le commissaire Mimica a souligné ce qui suit: «Le Niger est confronté à de nombreux défis et a déjà fait preuve à de nombreuses reprises d'une volonté politique forte et d'une autorité solide face à ces défis. L'Union européenne soutiendra financièrement le pays à hauteur d'environ 1 milliard d'euros pour la période 2017-2020. Nous nous attacherons surtout à garantir la fourniture de services sociaux de base tout en continuant de remédier aux problèmes urgents en matière de sécurité. Nous ne pouvons donner la priorité à une action au détriment de l'autre. »

Cette aide de l'UE a été déterminée conjointement avec le gouvernement nigérien et elle favorisera la mise en œuvre du plan de développement économique et social du Niger pour 2017-2021. L'aide de l'UE contribuera aussi au renforcement des capacités de l'État et à la fourniture de services sociaux. Elle permettra en outre de stimuler la création d'emplois et la croissance économique ainsi que de renforcer la sécurité alimentaire et la résilience et la lutte contre le changement climatique. Un accent particulier sera mis sur l'égalité hommes-femmes, l'émancipation et l'éducation des filles. L'aide de l'UE appuiera également les efforts de bonne gouvernance, la réforme du système national de justice et de sécurité ainsi que la lutte contre la migration irrégulière et la traite des êtres humains.

Dans le cadre de l'enveloppe financière de 1 milliard d'euros, le commissaire Mimica et le ministre nigérien des finances, M. Massoudou Hassoumi (à confirmer), ont signé une première convention de financement d'un montant de 40 millions d'euros en vue d'accroître le soutien de l'UE dans le secteur de la nutrition, la sécurité alimentaire et la résilience. Ils ont en outre signé un accord d'un montant de 64 millions d'euros pour la construction de centrales hybrides à Agadez et Gorou Banda. Le projet est cofinancé par l'Agence française de développement et bénéficie de subventions de l'UE pour un montant de 21 millions d'euros.

**Contexte**

Le Niger est confronté à des défis majeurs en matière de développement, la population ayant des besoins immenses en termes de services de base, de création d'emplois, de développement rural et d'accès à l'énergie. Le soutien de l'UE au Niger dans le cadre du programme indicatif national (11e fonds européen de développement) s'élève à 596 millions d'euros pour 2014-2020. Il porte sur quatre volets: 1) la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle, et la résilience; 2) le renforcement de la capacité de l'État pour la mise en œuvre des politiques sociales; 3) la sécurité, la gouvernance et la consolidation de la paix; 4) les routes d'accès aux zones affectées par l'insécurité et les risques de conflit.

Le Niger bénéficie de toute la palette des instruments européens pour l'appuyer dans son rôle de maintien de la stabilité dans la région, pour faire face aux défis économiques, budgétaires et humanitaires et pour l'accompagner dans la mise en œuvre de son plan national de développement, au profit de la population nigérienne. Le Niger est le premier bénéficiaire du fonds fiduciaire d'urgence pour l'Afrique, qui vise à lutter contre les causes profondes de l'instabilité, de la migration irrégulière et du phénomène des déplacements forcés.

L'Union européenne aide également le pays à faire face à l'instabilité et à l'insécurité, notamment la montée en puissance des groupes terroristes armés, l'augmentation des activités liées à la criminalité organisée transnationale, ainsi que le banditisme armé, la migration irrégulière et la traite des êtres humains. Pour l'aider à faire face à cette situation, l'UE joue un rôle de premier plan dans le soutien de la Force conjointe des pays du Sahel G5 (Mauritanie, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso et Tchad) afin d'améliorer les conditions de sécurité et la coopération transfrontalière dans la région.",268,"French"

**L’Opération d’enregistrement des réfugiés hors camp**

Depuis 2013, plusieurs milliers de réfugiés nigérians ont fui les exactions de Boko Haram et ont trouvé asile au Cameroun. Environ 32,459 d’entre eux ont préféré s’installer dans les communautés hôtes de la Région de l’Extrême-Nord. Ces individus répartis dans plus de 112 villages, vivent pour certains dans des familles d’accueil et pour d’autres sur des sites aménagés. Afin d’améliorer l’environnement de protection, le HCR et ses partenaires ont décidé de procéder à l’identification de ce groupe de personnes. Les départements du Logone-Et-Chari et du Mayo-Tsanaga abritant à eux seuls plus de 96% de la population totale concernée, c’est donc à juste titre que cette opération d’enregistrement des réfugiés nigérians vivant en dehors du camp de Minawao vise dans un premier temps, les deux départements sus cités.  

Ainsi, deux grandes équipes se sont déployées sur le terrain depuis le 15 juin 2017. Dans le Logone-et-Chari, 16,848 personnes ont été enregistrées par la première équipe. Du côté du Mayo-Tsanaga, après plus d’un mois de suspension des activités par les autorités administratives locales, l’exercice a finalement repris le 05 août dernier, grâce au plaidoyer du HCR.  

Dans le département du Mayo-Sava, la situation sécuritaire ne facilite pas la programmation de l’opération d’enregistrement des réfugiés vivant dans la zone. Toutefois, la Sous-Délégation du HCR à Maroua étudie les possibilités d’y étendre ce projet dans les prochains jours.",268,"French"

**Accord tripartite Cameroun/Nigéria/HCR: Vers un retour VOLONTAIRE des réfugiés**
 
L’Accord tripartite pour le rapatriement librement consenti des réfugiés nigérians vivant au Cameroun, a été signé 02 mars 2017 à Yaoundé, entre le Cameroun, le Nigéria et le HCR. Ce document est l’aboutissement d’un processus de négociation engagé en septembre 2016 entre les deux Etats. Il s’agit d’un cadre juridique qui définit les modalités du retour volontaire des réfugiés dans leur pays d’origine dans la sécurité et la dignité.  

Pour des besoins de contextualisation de l’Accord, la définition du terme « réfugié » a été quelque peu revue en son article premier et renvoie désormais à « tout ressortissant ou toute personne sans nationalité dont la résidence habituelle était au Nigéria, qui vit en tant que réfugié au Cameroun, conformément aux instruments juridiques nationaux, régionaux et internationaux pertinents en la matière. ».  

En ses articles 2 et 3, l’Accord énonce le caractère VOLONTAIRE du rapatriement, qui se basera sur des informations fiables et utiles sur les conditions qui prévalent dans le pays d’origine et les localités de retour. Ceci implique que ceux qui resteront continueront d’être régis par les normes et standards de protection internationale.  

La prochaine étape consiste en la mise en place des Organes de rapatriement et donc de la Commission Tripartite, tel qu’énoncé dans l’Accord en son article 22. La Commission Tripartite est l’Organe technique qui organise les opérations de rapatriement volontaire des réfugiés nigérians vivant au Cameroun. Elle est constituée de 06 membres, dont 02 membres du Cameroun et du Nigéria respectivement, avec leurs suppléants et 02 autres membres du HCR (l’un de la Représentation au Nigéria et l’autre de la Représentation au Cameroun). La Commission Tripartite pourra mettre en place un Groupe de Travail Technique pour l’assister dans l’exercice de ces fonctions. Ce Groupe de Travail interviendra de manière opérationnelle, en établissant notamment un chronogramme et en déterminant les points d’entrée, les sites pour centre de transit, etc.  

Plus de 85 000 réfugiés nigérians qui ont fui l’insurrection de Boko Haram dans le Nord-Est du Nigeria vivent actuellement dans la région de l’Extrême Nord du Cameroun.

Des jours au cours desquels priorité est mise sur la promotion au sein de la communauté, des actions en faveur de l’inclusion sociale et de la lutte contre les violences faites aux femmes et filles en vue de la réalisation des Objectifs du Développement Durable (ODD) au Cameroun et à travers le monde.  
Pour cette 26e édition, le thème retenu se veut interpellateur: « Ne laisser personne pour compte, mettre fin à la violence faite aux femmes et aux filles ». Il est un re et du principe essen el des ODD selon lequel les personnes les plus vulnérables doivent être prises en compte pour le développement durable. Le thème retenu ce e année interpelle à la mise en place d’une synergie d’actions perme ant de travailler en partenariat avec les communautés, les organismes des Natins Unies, les ONG, les gouvernements, la société civile et le secteur privé, afin de trouver des solutions idoines pour lutter contre cett  fléau. Il sollicite tous les acteurs et par es prenantes pour me re l’accent sur l’implémentation d’une solidarité agissant en faveur d’un monde exempt de violence pour toutes les femmes et les filles.  
Dans la région de l’Extrême-Nord, le HCR s’est joint aux agences sœurs du système des Nations Unies, pouvoirs publics, partenaires au développement, organisations de la société civile et autres parties prenantes pour promouvoir pendant ces 16 jours et au-delà, un monde sans violence fondée sur le genre. Pour ce e édition, l’accent a été mis sur la sensibilisation, l’éducation et la responsabilisation de tous les acteurs y compris les victimes, les auteurs, les familles et les communautés.  
La campagne internationale « 16 jours d’activisme » contre la violence faite aux femmes est menée tous les ans du 25 novembre, Journée interna onale pour l’élimination de la violence à l’égard des femmes, jusqu’au 10 décembre, Journée des droits de l’homme.

Dans son intervention, M. Ibrahim TOUBEYSSY, Sous-Préfet de Gossi a déclaré que cette action de la MINUSMA et ses multiples soutiens en faveur des populations en détresse, témoignent de sa volonté d’aider les autorités maliennes à stabiliser le pays. « Ce  joyau  qui fait la fierté des populations de Gossi, offrira désormais, un meilleur cadre de travail aux personnels chargés de leur sécurité, » s’est-il réjoui.

La réalisation de projets à impact rapide s’inscrit dans ce cadre. UNPOL appuie ses partenaires, que sont la Police Nationale, la Garde Nationale, la Gendarmerie et la Protection Civile, suivant quatre axes stratégiques à savoir : la protection des civils, du personnel des Nations Unies et leurs installations. L’accompagnement des Forces de Sécurité du Mali dans la mise en œuvre de l’accord de paix à travers la formation et l’équipement mais aussi, l’appui opérationnel aux Forces de la Sécurité du Mali, ainsi que le soutien au retour de l’autorité de l’Etat, notamment l’administration et du système judiciaire sont des tâches importantes confiées à la MINUSMA.",268,"French"
2380329,"La MINUSMA finance l’aménagement de 8 hectares au bénéfice des habitants de Forgho Une mission conjointe du bureau régional de la MINUSMA à Gao s’est rendue ce jeudi 14 décembre 2017 à Forgho dans la commune de Soni Aliber, cercle de Gao, pour évaluer les travaux d’aménagement de 8 hectares de périmètres maraichers entièrement financé par la MINUSMA.

Ces 8 hectares répartis entre cinq périmètres maraichers ont été financés par la MINUSMA à hauteur de plus de 56 millions de francs CFA pour contribuer à la réduction des violences communautaires à Forgho.  Ce projet qui a créé 1700 emplois dans cette localité, réduira considérablement l’immigration au sein de la jeunesse. « Nous sommes très contents et reconnaissants pour cette action que la MINUSMA est en train de réaliser chez nous. J’ai tenu à vous suivre dans chaque périmètre maraicher pour vous exprimer toute notre gratitude » a déclaré le vieux Amadou Moussa, conseillé du chef du village. 

Les travaux ont déjà commencé sur chacun des périmètres maraichers avec un engagement remarquable des communautés. Malgré quelques difficultés rencontrées dans leurs activités, les femmes et jeunes de Forgho sont parvenus à faire une première récolte qui va servir de semence. Ils ont produit une importante qualité de gombo. Actuellement, les pommes de terre, carottes, salade, tomates, arachides… sont semées et bien suivi malgré le problème d’eau qui persiste. « Nous ne pouvions pas imaginer avoir un jour trois jardins seulement pour les femmes et deux autres pour les jeunes. C’est une grande satisfaction pour nous de pouvoir rester au village et répondre aux besoins de nos familles à travers le maraichage. C’est pourquoi vous remarquez la présence des jeunes filles et jeunes garçons autour de nous en cette période de l’année. Nous nous sommes mises en regroupement  pour mieux gérer nos périmètres. Et malgré la difficulté d’eau que nous rencontrons souvent, nous avons mis en place un programme d’exploitation par petit groupe, pour que chacun puisse arroser son espace. Nous remercions la MINUSMA qui nous a réalisé ce rêve » a laissé entendre Khadijatou Ataher, Présidente de l’association des femmes de Forgho.

Sous la vigilance du contingent Bengladais de la MINUSMA, la délégation, après avoir parcouru les 25 km qui sépare la ville de Gao de Forgho, a visité chaque périmètre pour vérifier la qualité des travaux effectués par l’ONG GRAIP (Groupe de Recherche pour l’Amélioration des Initiatives des Populations). C’était en présence des notabilités, du maire, des organisations de femmes et de jeunes. « Nous étions venus pour la remise officielle de ces 5 jardins maraichers aux femmes et jeunes de Forgho. Après avoir visité chaque jardin, nous nous sommes rendu compte qu’il y a assez d’insuffisance qu’on ne pouvait pas laisser passer. C’est pourquoi nous allons surseoir à la remise et demander à l’ONG GRAIP de prendre en compte nos remarques sur la fourniture suffisante d’eau, une bonne organisation des femmes pour mieux faire fonctionner le comité de gestion, entre autres... Nous attendons que ces rectifications soient apportées avant de procéder à la remise officielle du projet. Nous voulons que ces communautés en proie à la violence, puissent bénéficier de ces projets impactant,  qui seront pérennisés » a précisé madame Aimée Thérèse Faye, représentante du chef du bureau et team leader de la section DDR/SSR à Gao.

Le report  de la remise officielle des périmètres maraichers a été salué par la municipalité, les femmes, jeunes  et notabilités de Forgho. « Nous saluons l’attention que vous avez porté à nos préoccupations. Nous restons engagés pour le suivi des améliorations qui seront faites par l’ONG partenaire » a soutenu M. Hamadou Issiaka adjoint au maire de la commune de Soni Ali Ber.

Depuis octobre 2016, les habitants des villages sur l’axe Botto ont subi des attaques récurrentes des
groupes armés entrainant des mouvements de population pendulaires (déplacement et retour). Ces
mouvements de populations sont amplifiés par les tensions préexistantes entre la population et les
éleveurs transhumants armés assimilés aux GMA, accusés de détruire les champs agricoles au
passage de leur bétail. Les habitants du village de Bamatara ont subi un nouveau choc la nuit du 17
au 18 Octobre 2017 : des hommes armés, assimilés aux GSA, se sont introduit dans le village
occasionnant le décès de deux personnes, un blessé grave, le vol de deux motos et d’une
conséquente somme d’argent.

Cette incursion a provoqué le déplacement massif et brusque des habitants de Bamatara, mais
également des habitants des villages voisions: Fah village et Fah pilote (situés entre 1-3 km de
Bamatara). La majeure partie de la population a trouvé refuge dans la brousse/champs situé dans un
rayon de 1 à 2 kilomètres de leur village d’origine ; une autre partie de la population s’est réfugiée
dans les villages environnant (Botokon 1 et 2).

Craignant de nouvelles incursions, une partie de la population déplacée a passé plusieurs nuits dans
la brousse. Des mouvements de retour se sont progressivement amorcés à partir du 25 Octobre
2017. Dans la brousse, la population vit dans des conditions humanitaires alarmantes : abris précaire,
accès limité à l’eau potable et à l’hygiène ayant un impact direct sur la santé. Dans ces conditions,
certains ménages retournent dans leur village d’origine malgré l’incertitude sécuritaire qui prévaut.
Cependant, à leur retour dans leurs villages d’origine, les populations retournées ont enregistrées
des vols de leurs biens, qu’ils avaient dû laisser derrière eux. La régularité des chocs dans la zone a
affaibli les capacités de résilience et de survie des habitants. Ils sont quasiment dépourvus de biens
de première nécessité et leur mode de vie est basé sur la subsistance.

L’évaluation multisectorielle (MSA), réalisée du 31 Octobre au 1er Novembre 2017, avait soulevé des
besoins en assistance multisectorielle : besoins prioritaires en Articles Ménagers Essentiels (AME), en
vivres, en EHA, en santé, en éducation et en protection. La MSA a été partagé le 7 novembre 2017
aux partenaires du RRM. Une intervention en EHA a été validée par le Comité de Pilotage RRM le 8
Novembre et l’intervention en AME le 15 Novembre 2017. Cette réponse multisectorielle et
complémentaire en AME et en EHA a permis (i) de couvrir les besoins complémentaires en AME et

2379854,"Migrants en transit : peu de migrants économiques et des violences policières persistantes Depuis octobre, Médecins du Monde a mené 746 consultations médicales, sociales ou psychologiques de migrants en transit à Bruxelles. Depuis leur lancement, les consultations – menée au hub humanitaire de la rue Frontispice - ont plus que doublé, passant de 40 à 100 par semaine. Les déclarations des personnes reçues indiquent que les violences policières restent un problème.

Des migrants majoritairement économiques à Bruxelles ? Médecins du Monde dément cette affirmation en cette Journée Internationale des Migrants. Deux tiers des personnes rencontrées en consultations venaient du Soudan (entre 40 et 55%) et d’Erythrée (entre 15 et 25%). Suivent la Libye, la Syrie et l’Irak.

« La plupart de ces personnes viennent de pays pour lesquels le taux de reconnaissance du statut de réfugié est très élevé, » explique Pierre Verbeeren, directeur de Médecins du Monde. « Si elles introduisaient une demande, elles auraient de fortes chances qu’elle soit acceptée. Mais elles ne le font pas parce qu’elles pensent que la Belgique n’acceptera pas de l’examiner, à cause du règlement ‘Dublin’. Celui-ci stipule en effet que c’est le pays par lequel est rentré le migrant qui doit étudier la demande. Or, les gens que nous rencontrons ont dû donner leurs empreintes digitales dans un autre pays européen avant d’entrer en Belgique. »

**Une violence policière persistante**

Les personnes migrantes rencontrées continuent de pointer les actions policières comme problématiques. « Les rafles ont heureusement cessé, » précise Nel Vandevannet, directrice des projets belges de Médecins du Monde. « Mais nous recevons de nombreux témoignages de gens donc les biens ont été confisqués. Ils sont particulièrement ciblés par des contrôles dans les transports en commun et sont régulièrement confrontés à des violences émanant des policiers. » Et de citer l’histoire de ce jeune homme qui a dû être hospitalisé pour une vilaine fracture à la jambe suite à une intervention de la police. Une enquête sur ce cas serait d’ailleurs ouverte au Comité P.

La violence et les conditions de vie précaires justifient l’essentiel des plaintes médicales. « Infection des voies respiratoires (24%), blessures ouvertes, ecchymoses et douleurs articulaires (17%), gale (4%) et troubles de la santé mentale (4%) sont les diagnostics caractéristiques d’une vie à la rue dans l’anxiété constante et de mauvaises conditions d’hygiène, » détaille encore Nel Vandevannet. « S’il n’y avait l’hospitalité des citoyens belges, la situation serait encore bien pire. »

**Des femmes et des mineurs en situation préoccupante**

Médecins du Monde est particulièrement préoccupée par la situation des femmes et des enfants. Tous les indicateurs européens montrent que les mineurs (11% des consultations) et les femmes (8%) sont particulièrement vulnérables aux violences sexuelles et à la traite des êtres humains. Malgré l’engagement important des citoyens et des organisations humanitaires, cette vulnérabilité persiste lorsque les personnes sont obligées de vivre dans la clandestinité. Child Focus rapportait récemment avoir vu tripler le nombre de mineurs étrangers non accompagnés disparus. Pour Médecins du Monde, des efforts plus importants doivent être faits par les autorités pour protéger ces groupes vulnérables.

 Las combats de novembre dernier entre les groupes armés sur les axes autour de Bria, notamment Bria – Ippy, Bria – Yalinga, Bria – Ouadda, et Bria – Aigbando, ont conduit à la fuite de la quasi-totalité de la population qui y vivait. La plupart de cette population se trouve désormais sur le site de PK03 dans la ville de Bria. Cette situation affecte considérablement le ravitaillement de la ville de Bria en divers produits de consommation courante. Seul l’axe Bria – Yalinga, reste ouvert jusqu’à 35 Km pour l’instant. Cependant, une équipe humanitaire en mission médicale (clinique mobile) a été refoulée au courant de la semaine par les éléments d’un groupe armé sur ce même axe, lui exigeant un ordre de mission délivré par la hiérarchie de ces derniers au niveau de Bria.

***- Mobilisation d’hommes armés dans une zone de retour potentiel, S/P Kouango***

Selon des sources concordantes, un renforcement en hommes ainsi qu’une multiplication des check-points par des éléments présumés d’autodéfense ont été rapportés le 08 et 09 décembre dans les villages Bolo-Ndoro, 41 et 46 Km respectivement au nord de Kouango (axe Kouango-Lihoto). Une mobilisation similaire rapportée dans la zone de Pendé, 45 Km au nord-ouest de Kouango. Les usagers de ces axes/zones, y compris des humanitaires, sont soumis au paiement des certaines taxes par ces hommes. Ce développement serait consécutif à l’incursion d’un groupe adverse sur l’axe Ngadza-Ndoro-Bolo le 04 décembre au cours de laquelle une personne avait été blessée par balle, et une autre faite prisonnière, entrainant ainsi un important mouvement de populations vers la brousse et les villages voisins.

2379604,"Info-Niño/Niña - Décembre 2017 **Situation actuelle et perspectives**

**Les températures de surface de la mer dans l'est du Pacifique tropical accusent depuis peu une tendance à la baisse, affichant désormais des valeurs caractéristiques d’une anomalie La Niña de faible intensité. La plupart des indicateurs atmosphériques vont dans le même sens, dans la mesure où ils traduisent les prémices d'un épisode La Niña. Selon les modèles de climat considérés, la situation actuelle devrait persister jusqu'au premier trimestre de 2018. Un retour à des conditions neutres d'ici à la fin de l'année est moins probable, tandis que le développement d'un épisode El Niño avant le deuxième trimestre de 2018 semble exclu.**

Les Services météorologiques et hydrologiques nationaux (SMHN) continueront de suivre de près l'évolution de la situation au cours des prochains mois.  

Depuis le mois d'octobre, dans une grande partie du Pacifique tropical, les températures de surface de la mer, qui attestaient de conditions neutres, ont franchi le seuil de manifestation d’un épisode La Niña de faible intensité, affichant une anomalie négative comprise entre 0,5 et 1,0 degré Celsius dans la partie centre-est du bassin. Les indicateurs atmosphériques trahissent eux aussi la présence d'une anomalie La Niña, avec des précipitations accrues sur l'extrême ouest du Pacifique et une zone de précipitations réduites à proximité de la ligne de changement de date.  

On observe par ailleurs un renforcement des alizés dans l'ouest du Pacifique tropical, tandis que la pression au niveau de la mer affiche des valeurs supérieures à la normale dans le Pacifique Est et inférieures à la normale dans l'ouest, ce qui est caractéristique d'un épisode La Niña.  
Dans le centre-est du Pacifique, les couches profondes de l'océan sont demeurées légèrement plus froides que la normale depuis octobre, jusqu'à plusieurs centaines de mètres en-dessous de la surface. Ces eaux profondes étant souvent annonciatrices des changements à venir en surface, aucune hausse des températures de surface de la mer, qui accusent actuellement une anomalie négative, ne semble être à l'ordre du jour jusqu'à courant janvier.  

Au cours des deux prochains mois, selon la plupart des modèles considérés, les températures de surface de la mer dans le centre-est du Pacifique tropical pourraient continuer de baisser tout en restant dans la fourchette des valeurs caractéristiques d'un épisode La Niña de faible intensité (de 0,5 à 1,0 degré Celsius en-dessous de la normale). Un petit nombre de modèles annonce même une anomalie négative supérieure à 1,0 degré Celsius. En se basant sur ces prévisions et sur l'avis des experts, on peut affirmer que la probabilité que l'anomalie La Niña persiste durant le premier trimestre de 2018 est de 70 à 80 %. Enfin, il est quasiment exclu qu'un épisode El Niño se manifeste avant le deuxième trimestre de 2018.  

Il convient de souligner que les phénomènes El Niño et La Niña ne sont pas les seuls facteurs qui déterminent les régimes climatiques à l’échelle du globe. En outre, il n’y a pas nécessairement de corrélation directe entre l’intensité d’un épisode ENSO et l'ampleur de ses incidences. Au plan régional, les prévisions saisonnières doivent tenir compte des effets respectifs du phénomène El Niño/Oscillation australe et d'autres phénomènes influant sur le climat à l'échelle locale. On sait, par exemple, que la température de surface de l’océan Indien, du Pacifique Sud-Est et de l'Atlantique tropical a une incidence sur le climat des zones continentales adjacentes. Des informations exploitables à l'échelle régionale et locale peuvent être tirées des prévisions climatiques saisonnières de portée régionale ou nationale, comme celles qui émanent des centres climatologiques régionaux de l’OMM (CCR), des forums régionaux sur l’évolution probable du climat et des SMHN.",268,"French"

Zone évaluée: le site de Madjakani est situé sur l’axe kiskra-Diamerom dans la souspréfecture de Liwa, préfecture de Foulli. Il se sépare du canton de kiskra à une distance d’environ 32km et à 38 Km de la ville de Bagasola.  
Le site se localise sur la carte géographique de la Région du Lac à travers les coordonnées GPS suivantes : 13°58’39.47’’ de longitude et 13°53’36.64” de Latitude.

Population : la population du site est estimée à 313 ménages soit 1566 habitants. Ces données sont obtenues grâce au comptage physique de la population par une stratégie de regroupement des ménages par village de provenance. Cette stratégie de recensement sert d’estimer la population en attendant d’obtenir les données de recensement exhaustif qui est en cours avec l’OIM.  
La population serait arrivée sur le site depuis trois (3) mois, à la date du 28/06/2017.  
Principalement des boudoumas, la population du site est venue du village de KeroKadoua situé à quelques dizaines de kilomètres de Kaïgua-kindjiria dans la zone frontalière TchadNiger.

Selon les leaders du site (Boulama, l’Imam,…), le choix de cette destination a été fait par lien ancestral et sans avis préalable des autorités locales.

Chocs : Depuis l’attaque du camp militaire de Kaïgua Kindjiria en mai 2017 par les éléments de la secte islamiste Boko Haram qui a causé la mort d’une quarantaine de personnes, des mouvements de population se sont multipliés de la zone frontalière avec le Niger, Nigeria vers Bagasola. Tous ces mouvements selon les populations, tiennent leur cause à des attaques directes (village) ou indirectes (village voisin) ou par crainte d’être attaqué par Boko Haram.  
Comme la plupart des cas, la population déplacée de Madjakani évoque comme cause de leur mouvement, l’attaque de Boko haram. La communauté serait victime d’enlèvement de 7 personnes parmi lesquels, il y avait 3 femmes et 4 enfants, ce qui a crée un sentiment de peur au sein de la population causant ainsi le choix de quitter les lieux.  
Depuis son arrivée sur ce site, à part une mission de prospection d’Action contre la Faim dépêchée sur le lieu, aucune autre ONG n’a fait cas de présence.

Méthodologie utilisée: L’évaluation RRM s’est basée sur la méthodologie standard d’évaluation RRM adaptée au Tchad sur base du questionnaire MIRA. Elle a été organisée autour de la collecte de données qualitatives, à travers des groupes de discussions et des entretiens avec de personnes ressources : autorités locales, groupes des femmes et des hommes,

Administratrice Associée Chargée de la protection communautaire UNHCR Iriba Iriba (HCR) –   

Dans la nuit du jeudi 14 décembre 2017, les réfugiés du camp d’Iridimi, à 17 km de la ville d’Iriba, dans l’Est du Tchad, ont organisé un évènement particulier dans le cadre de l’accès à l’énergie renouvelable.
  
Les habitants de ce camp de réfugiés soudanais, qui avaient à leurs côtés pour l’occasion des travailleurs humanitaires, ont tenu une nuit lumineuse pour marquer leur reconnaissance quant à la distribution de lampes solaires et l’installation de lampadaires solaires dont ils ont été les heureux bénéficiaires à l’instar des autres camps d’Iriba. L’initiateur de ce geste est la Fondation IKEA en partenariat avec le HCR.

Cette fête de la lumière a été célébrée sous le thème de « la gestion efficiente de l’énergie.  

Pour précisions, la Fondation IKEA qui s’est fixée pour objectif d’améliorer la vie de milliers de populations vulnérables a choisi de fournir des lampes solaires aux familles réfugiées et équiper les camps de lampadaires solaires pour l’éclairage public.

Le Tchad fait partie des pays choisis par ladite Fondation pour ce projet d’accès à l’énergie renouvelable à travers la Sous-Délégation du HCR à Iriba pour une période de 2 ans (2016-2017) avec à la clé un don d’environ 21.000 lampes solaires et 286 lampadaires solaires. 

La mise en œuvre de ce projet d’éclairage solaire a débuté en avril 2016 avec des rencontres d’information et de sensibilisation de la communauté humanitaire et des bénéficiaires. La distribution des lampes solaires a été effectuée d’août à septembre 2017 par le partenaire ADES en collaboration avec le HCR et la CNARR. Chaque ménage dans les camps d’Iridimi, Touloum et Amnabak et dans une dizaine de villages alentours de chaque camp a bénéficié d’une lampe solaire. 

Ce sont au total, 16.205 ménages réfugiés et 2.600 ménages autochtones qui ont été servis. Les 286 lampadaires ont été répartis entre les trois camps et installés sur des sites choisis de commun accord avec les communautés de réfugiés. 

Pour garantir la pérennité des équipements, 13 jeunes des camps d’Iridimi (8) et Touloum (5) constitués de 3 filles et 10 garçons ont bénéficié d’une formation en électricité et énergie renouvelable sur une période de 9 mois au Centre de Formation Professionnelle de Farchana supervisé par le partenaire FLM. 

Les jeunes formés ont regagné leurs camps de provenance au courant du mois de décembre 2017 avec en mains, un diplôme en électricité et un kit de sortie pour chacun.

Les festivités relatives à la nuit lumineuse ont été marquées par des allocutions, des démonstrations et conseils sur l’utilisation des lampes solaires, des conseils sur la protection des lampadaires et une visite guidée pour contempler les lampadaires. 

Les différents intervenants se sont attelés à rappeler aux bénéficiaires, la nécessité de veiller sur le matériel d’éclairage qui permettra d’alléger leurs peines par rapport à l’énergie domestique, de favoriser les révisions nocturnes pour les élèves, de réduire l’insécurité dans les camps et d’améliorer l’économie des ménages à travers des activités commerciales continues en soirée. En gros, ce projet participe à la protection et au bien-être des réfugiés qui feront des économies grâce à l’accès à l’énergie et éclairage durables. 

Le HCR représenté par l’Administratrice Associée Chargée de la Protection Communautaire n’a pas manqué d’insister auprès des réfugiés de faire un usage rationnel du bien reçu, de le protéger contre les éventuels cas de vol et/ou destruction. Elle a en outre, émis le vœu de voir les réparations des équipements défectueux être assurées par les jeunes diplômés en électricité du centre de formation professionnelle de Farchana. Elle a dit espérer que le bon exemple des réfugiés d’Iridimi, favorisera davantage d’appui dans ce cadre. Ces propos ont été soutenus par le chef de bureau ADES et le cheikh des cheikhs du camp. 

Ce dernier a partagé, au nom de tous les réfugiés, le sentiment de satisfaction générale quant à la réception de ces matériels d’éclairage au regard de leur grande utilité pour la communauté. Il en a remercié le HCR et ses partenaires. Les jeunes diplômés ont, quant à eux, rassuré avoir toutes les connaissances requises pour répondre favorablement au besoin de réparation des lampadaires en cas de panne.

Une présentation de la composante du kit de sortie a été faite par une jeune fille diplômée pour démontrer de leur savoir en la matière. Des prises de photos ont mis un terme à cette belle soirée lumineuse.",268,"French"
2378844,"Optimiser le traitement de la malnutrition Depuis 2012, dans plusieurs régions d'Afrique, ALIMA et ses partenaires apprennent aux mères et autres parents à utiliser un simple ruban tricolore, connu sous le nom de MUAC, afin de dépister les premiers signes de malnutrition chez leurs enfants.

Trop souvent, les enfants qui arrivent au centre de santé se trouvent déjà à un stade avancé de malnutrition ; il est donc important que les mères puissent mesurer régulièrement le périmètre brachial de leurs enfants à la maison, plutôt que d'attendre chaque mois qu'un agent de santé communautaire vienne dépister leurs enfants. Lorsque le périmètre brachial de l'enfant indique la partie rouge ou la partie jaune du ruban - représentant respectivement la malnutrition aiguë sévère (MAS) et la malnutrition aiguë modérée (MAM) – la famille devra alors consulter un médecin. A l’image du thermomètre, il s’agit d’un outil facile à utiliser qui permet aux mères de veiller sur la santé nutritionnelle de leurs enfants.

Cependant la procédure pour admettre les enfants dans programmes de traitement de la malnutrition reste trop compliquée. La différence entre la partie jaune et la partie rouge du ruban MUAC représente seulement 1 mm, mais les programmes de traitement correspondants sont gérés par différents acteurs, suivent des protocoles différents et utilisent différents aliments thérapeutiques. Dans de nombreuses régions, les programmes de traitement de la malnutrition aiguë modérée ne bénéficient plus de financement, et cela a pour conséquence que, lorsqu’un enfant est suffisamment malade pour accéder au programme de traitement de la malnutrition aiguë sévère, il est déjà sur le point de devoir être hospitalisé et aura besoin d’un plus grand nombre de rations de nourriture thérapeutique.

C’est pourquoi ALIMA essaie d'aller encore plus loin en éliminant les barrières qui existent entre le traitement des enfants modérément malnutris et celui des enfants sévèrement malnutris. Dans le cadre d'une étude connue sous le nom MUAC-Only (OptiMA) au Burkina Faso, le consortium ALIMA/SOS Médecins/Keoogo continue à former les mères à l’utilisation du ruban MUAC, tout en élargissant les critères d'admission pour inclure tous les enfants dans le même programme, qu’ils souffrent de malnutrition modérée ou sévère. Cela a pour effet de diminuer le risque de complications et d'hospitalisation. De plus, en réduisant progressivement les rations alimentaires thérapeutiques à mesure que les enfants regagnent la santé et que leur périmètre brachial augmente, on peut traiter plus d'enfants pour un coût similaire.

Le Gouvernement du Burundi apprécie les efforts fournis par les pays de la sous Région afin de trouver des solutions aux problèmes burundais. C’est dans ce cadre qu’il voudrait d’abord remercier et réitérer sa confiance au Médiateur dans le dialogue inter - Burundais Son Excellence YOWERI KAGUTA MUSEVENI et au facilitateur Son Excellence William Benjamin MKAPA pour les efforts déployés afin de trouver un terrain d’entente entre la classe politique burundaise.

2.  Le Gouvernement du Burundi a suivi avec une attention particulière le déroulement des travaux de la 4ème Session de Dialogue inter-Burundais tenue à Arusha, à NGURDOTO en Tanzanie du 27 novembre au 8 décembre 2017 et à laquelle il a répondu présent, qui réunissait les représentants des partis politiques, les acteurs politiques ainsi que la société civile.

3.  Le Gouvernement remercie le facilitateur Son Excellence Benjamin William MKAPA pour avoir écouté toutes les parties et surtout pour avoir compris la préoccupation du peuple burundais envers la souveraineté nationale et l’Etat de droit en invitant à la table du dialogue et d’une façon inclusif les acteurs politiques non poursuivis par la justice ni frappé du Mandat d’Arrêt International.

4.  Le Gouvernement du Burundi salue l’esprit constructif qui a caractérisé les participants à cette Session et se réjouit des conclusions qui en sont sorties, puisque le Facilitateur a pu dégager des points de convergences de loin plus nombreux que ceux de divergences sur les questions qui figuraient à l’agenda de la Session.

5.  Le Gouvernement du Burundi note avec satisfaction que les points de convergence entre la classe politique burundaise porte principalement sur que les questions fondamentales de la vie politique, sociale et économique d’un pays, notamment la reconnaissance de la souveraineté de la République du Burundi, les droits politiques, économiques et sociaux de tous les Burundais, ainsi que l’engagement de la classe politique à mettre fin à l’impunité et à rejeter toutes les formes de violence y compris les discours de haine comme moyens de résoudre les différends. Le Gouvernement remercie à cet effet les différents participants tant des Partis Politiques que de la Société Civile qui ont montré leur esprit patriotique en mettant en avant les intérêts supérieurs de leur pays, en défendant sa souveraineté et les principes démocratiques.

6.  Le Gouvernement rappelle que le Dialogue a, de tout temps, caractérisé les Burundais et qu’il est par principe permanent. Ainsi avec les résultats de la 4ème session qui est la dernière tenue à l’étranger, ce Dialogue va se poursuivre et compléter celui qui a rassemblé les Burundais de l’intérieur. Le Gouvernement voudrait une fois de plus, lancer un appel aux politiciens non poursuivis par la Justice en particulier, encore à l’étranger et aux autres réfugiés en général, à rentrer dans leur pays et contribuer aux préparatifs des échéances électorales de 2020. Le Gouvernement s’engage à prendre toutes les mesures utiles pour leur sécurité, ce qui rentre par ailleurs dans ses missions de tous les jours.

7.  Le Gouvernement du Burundi rappelle que le Burundi n’est pas dans une crise, encore moins dans une impasse politique, car les Institutions en place élues par le peuple en 2015 sont fonctionnelles. Il réaffirme sa détermination à défendre la souveraineté et l’Indépendance politique et économique du pays.

8.  Aussi, très prochainement le Gouvernement va être lancer la campagne de vulgarisation et d’explication des dispositions proposées pour une Constitution nouvelle amendée dans l’esprit de renforcer cette souveraineté fondée sur les valeurs de justice, de démocratie, de pluralisme, de respect des libertés et des droits fondamentaux de l’individu, de l’unité et de solidarité nationale comme recommandé par la population lors du Dialogue Intérieur. Le projet de la nouvelle Constitution sera soumis au référendum populaire pour son adoption conformément aux dispositions pertinentes de la Constitution en vigueur.

9.  Le Gouvernement du Burundi appelle tous les burundais en général, et les hommes politiques en particulier, à s’inscrire dans la logique de la paix et du patriotisme en participant à ce processus qui constitue une étape importante des préparatifs des élections de 2020 dont il garantit le caractère inclusif et dans un climat apaisé.

Le Territoire de Fizi est depuis fin juin 2017 affecté par des affrontements récurrents entre les Mayi Mayi de la CNPSC (Coalition Nationale du Peuple pour la Souveraineté du Congo) dirigée par Yakutumba et les FARDC. Ces violences qui se cristallisent dans la région frontalière entre le Sud-Kivu, Tanganyika et le Maniema, sont également liées aux conflits entre les Batwa d’un côté, les bergers Banyamulenge et les Bafuliru de l’autre, dans la Province du Tanganyika. L’insécurité née des combats entre les belligérants pousse de façon effrénée, des milliers de populations dans l’errance. Dans le territoire de Fizi où s’est déroulé la mission du 29 novembre au 02 Décembre, les axes ci-dessous ont été évalués :  Axe Fizi-Lumanya (Fizi centre, Kananda, Mukera et Kitshula),  Axe Malinde-Simbi (localités de Simbi, et Malinde)  Axe Baraka-Sebele (localités Sebele, Mulongwe, Malinde, Katanga et Baraka)  

Le contexte sécuritaire est toujours volatil à l’intérieur de ces trois axes. Près de 7 631 ménages, soit 38 157 personnes déplacées au total, y ont été accueillies dans plusieurs localités, au cours des nouvelles violences qui ont opposé les FARDC aux Mayi Mayi entre octobre et novembre 2017 à Kikonde, Kananda, Simbi, Mukera, Kichula et Lumanya (à l’intérieur du Territoire de Fizi). Ces nouveaux déplacements traduisent déjà la diversité de besoins auxquels non seulement ces derniers sont confrontés mais aussi les familles hôtes. L’analyse des besoins a été développée par secteur et a dégagé les tendances qui justifient la nécessité de l’aide humanitaire pour les déplacés et les familles qui les ont accueillis. La récolte et l’analyse des besoins ont été effectuées par les clusters à travers les méthodes d’observation directe, organisation des « Focus groups » et entretiens semis structurés.  

Au regard des résultats sectoriels obtenus, pour la sécurité alimentaire, les travaux journaliers agricoles sont les moyens pratiqués par la majorité de déplacés comme source de revenu et de nourriture. Dans plusieurs localités d’accueil, la tâche par individu pour le travail de champs par exemple un champ de 25 m2 contribue en moyenne à 80% aux sources de revenue pour les ménages déplacés qui sont soit payés en argent et ou en nature (manioc). Ce mécanisme de survie n’arrive malheureusement pas à combler tous les besoins auxquels font face les déplacés. Il s’agit d’un moyen juste pour se procurer n’est fut ce qu’un repas journalier. Les déplacés vivent aussi de la générosité des familles d’accueil (dons, partage des repas).  

L’agriculture est la principale activité et source de revenu et de nourriture pour plus ou moins 90% de la population de la zone évaluée. Le vol, les maladies des cultures (manioc, bananier), et l’insécurité dans certaines zones de production sont parmi les facteurs majeurs de l’insécurité alimentaire. Pour certains déplacés, le système de métayage est aussi pratiqué pour avoir accès à la terre. Cependant, ces derniers ayant tout perdu n’arrivent pas à se procurer les intrants agricoles et de l’argent pour louer les terres arables. En raison de cette pauvreté des parents, 76% parmi les enfants déplacés en âges scolaires sont déscolarisés ou non scolarisés. Par contre, les enfants autochtones le sont à 27%. Sur le plan nutritionnel, une enquête nutritionnelle smart ou un screening rapide est requise afin d’évaluer précisément l’état nutritionnel des tous les ménages déplacés et autochtones. Toutefois, les quelques données brutes présentées à la mission par les structures sanitaires visitées, concernant les admissions aux CNS et UNTA laissent présager une prévalence élevée de malnutrition dans la zone.  

Dans plusieurs localités d’accueil, les déplacés ont accès difficile aux soins de santé, à l’exception de l’aire de santé de Kananda appuyée par AAP (Projet de la Banque de Mondiale). Celle de Simbi, n’offre pas aux déplacés la gratuité de soins alors qu’elle est également appuyée par la même organisation. A Sebele par contre, la gratuité des soins de santé est assurée aux enfants de moins de 15 ans et aux femmes enceintes grâce à l’appui de partenaires humanitaires. Dans les trois axes d’accueil des déplacés, les pathologies ci-dessous, classées par ordre d’importance prédominent (I) le paludisme, (II) les maladies diarrhéiques et (III) les infections respiratoire aigues (IRA). Les maladies diarrhéiques, résultent généralement des problèmes d’accès à l’eau potable et d’insuffisances des mesures d’hygiène et d’assainissement observées en grande partie à Simbi, Kananda, Sebele. Les problèmes de protection des civils (arrestations arbitraires, extorsions, viols …) de la part des FARDC sur fond de présomption d’appartenance au groupe Mayi Mayi ont été relevés.  

Pour près de la dizaine des cas de viol rapportée à l’intervalle de 3 derniers mois dans l’aire de santé de Simbi, nombreuses d’entre elles préfèrent garder silence en raison notamment des menaces de la part de leurs bourreaux et des pesanteurs culturelles.  

En éducation, l’accès reste très limité pour les enfants déplacés en particulier. Les disparités entre le nombre des filles qui vont à l’école par rapport aux garçons est très considérables. Nombreuses n’ont pas la chance de terminer leurs études primaires. Elles courent le risque énorme de viols et mariage précoce.  

Décidément, au regard des difficultés et/ou des problèmes humanitaires révélés lors de l’évaluation, les membres de la mission ont, selon leurs secteurs respectifs, suggéré quelques pistes de solutions sous forme des recommandations, suivant les tendances dégagées après analyse de résultats. Il faut cependant noter que le contexte étant très volatile, certains déplacés font des mouvements pendulaires.",268,"French"

Kinshasa le 15 décembre 2017 - La MONUSCO se félicite de la décision rendue dans le procès de Kavumu, le 13 décembre 2017, par la Cour militaire du Sud-Kivu dans l’affaire des enlèvements et viols de 38 enfants, qui a condamné le député provincial du Sud-Kivu Frédéric Batumike et  11 autres personnes à perpétuité pour crimes contre l’humanité par viol et par meurtre. La Cour a par ailleurs accordé des réparations aux victimes.

Maman Sidikou, le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies en RDC et Chef de la MONUSCO a salué la tenue d’un procès sans précédent ainsi que la décision prise, qui constitue une avancée majeure dans la lutte contre l’impunité des violences sexuelles en RDC.

Par cette décision, la Cour militaire et, à travers elle, la justice congolaise rappelle que personne n’est au-dessus de la loi, quel que soit son statut. Bien qu’elle soit susceptible d’appel, cette décision est un signe encourageant pour les nombreuses victimes de violences sexuelles et autres violations graves des droits de l’homme, dont les auteurs restent souvent impunis.

« J’exhorte les autorités congolaises à poursuivre leurs efforts afin que tous les auteurs de violations des droits de l’homme, du droit international humanitaire et d’autres crimes graves soient traduits devant les juridictions compétentes, indépendamment de leur statut », a déclaré Maman Sidikou.

Avec les partenaires de la justice congolaise dont l’équipe d’experts des Nations Unies sur l’Etat de droit et les violences sexuelles en période de conflit, la MONUSCO, avec ses partenaires de la justice au plan national  et  international s’est engagée, depuis 2014, pour l’ouverture d’enquêtes, la protection des victimes et des témoins ainsi que l’appui logistique et sécuritaire ayant permis aux autorités judiciaires congolaises de mener les investigations et organiser un procès équitable dans la cité de Kavumu.

Enfin, la MONUSCO se réjouit que la tenue de cette audience, suivie tant au plan national qu’international, soit le résultat de l’effort collectif et persistant de la Représentante personnelle du chef de l’Etat congolais en charge de la lutte contre les violences sexuelles et le recrutement des enfants, des défenseurs des droits de l’homme,  et de différents acteurs engagés dans la lutte contre l’impunité.",268,"French"
2378739,"Les maires de Bangui et environs et la MINUSCA passent en revue les questions sécuritaires C’est entouré du Commandant de la Force, le Lieutenant-général Balla Keita, et du Commissaire adjoint de la Police, Jean-Michel Turquois, que Le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général et chef de la MINUSCA, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, a reçu, ce vendredi 15 décembre 2017, les maires  des huit arrondissements de Bangui pour un moment d’échanges sur des préoccupations du moment.

Au menu, des préoccupations sécuritaires au niveau de Bangui et l’explication du nouveau mandat assigné à la MINUSCA par le Conseil de sécurité à travers la résolution 2387 en date du 15 novembre 2017. Un nouveau mandat qui réitère la nécessaire la protection des civils, en appui aux autorités centrafricaines dont c’est la responsabilité principale, mais aussi le besoin d’appuyer les processus de dialogue pour réduire la menace des groupes armés, sans oublier l’aide à la « mise en place de conditions de sûreté favorables à l’acheminement immédiat, complet, en toute sécurité et sans entrave de l’aide humanitaire ».

« Le relèvement du pays et de la ville de Bangui se poursuit mais les défis sont immenses. Les choses seraient plus simples si nous travaillons ensemble », a indiqué le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général, dans son introduction à la rencontre fortement motivée par une « réelle volonté de travailler ensemble ». D’ailleurs, le Maire de Bangui, Emile Raymond Nakombo, a réitéré sa volonté et celui de ses pairs de s’inscrire dans l’appui à la MINUSCA pour ramener la sécurité dans la ville de Bangui. « Nous sommes déterminés à prendre notre responsabilité pour que nos concitoyens vivent en sécurité et vous ne serez qu’en appui. Ceci pour vous montrer que la sécurité est un souci préoccupant pour nous », a-t-il dit.

Occasion pour les maires de Bangui et environs de suivre différentes présentations relatives au dispositif sécuritaire de Bangui et au programme de la réduction de la violence communautaire. 

S’en est suivi un moment d’échanges durant lesquels des maires ont  exprimé les ressentis de leurs concitoyens de plus en plus nombreux quant aux questions sécuritaires. « Cette situation oblige, d’abord et avant tout, à réfléchir et agir différemment à l’échelle de nos responsabilités. Sachons travailler différemment et ensemble pour le bien de la population », a souligné Brigitte Andarra maire du 4eme arrondissement de Bangui. 

« Vous êtes des partenaires indispensables et tout l’appui vous sera donné pour de meilleurs résultats », a souligné en retour le Commandant de la Force le général Balla Keita. 

Les maires ont exprimé le désir que ce type de dialogue puisse se poursuivre pour qu’ils soient effectivement le relais entre la MINUSCA et les populations comme l’a souligné Balla Dodo, maire du 3eme arrondissement. « C’est un moment qui nous a permis de nous parler avec franchise et aussi de réaffirmer notre volonté de travailler ensemble pour le que la sécurité puisse être effective à Bangui mais aussi sur l’ensemble du territoire »",268,"French"
2378734,"Le pouvoir des femmes Le jardinage est une activité complémentaire courante pour les femmes du Mali, qui tirent leur revenus de la vente de légumes. Mais la raréfaction de l’eau due aux changements climatiques a rendu la vie difficile.

“Nous manquons d’eau. Le jardinage est devenu presque impossible », explique Fatoumata Diarra, membre d’une coopérative de femmes du village de Massantola.

Les hommes sont généralement responsables des cultures de rente telles que le coton, le millet ou le riz. Mais avec des averses moins fréquentes et une saison des pluies plus courte, ces exploitations sont de plus en plus fragiles, mettant plus de pression sur les femmes. Elles doivent non seulement travailler, mais aussi obtenir suffisamment d’eau et de nourriture pour soutenir leur famille.

Avec l‘intensification des sécheresses, il faut plus de temps pour récolter l’eau potable et le bois de chauffe.

Tanganyika est le forum chargé de la coordination des actions concernant la protection de l’enfant dans les situations d’urgence, sous la direction de l’UNICEF et la co-direction du Gouvernement et de l’ONG nationale Réponse aux Catastrophes et aux Initiatives de Développement (RCID) dans la province du Tanganyika. Constituant un « domaine de responsabilité» du Cluster Protection, il réunit le Ministère des Affaires Sociales, Action Humanitaire et Solidarité Nationale et des organisations nongouvernementales impliquées dans des projets de protection de l'enfance en situation d'urgence avec l’objectif de garantir des interventions plus prévisibles, responsables et efficaces. Pour ce faire, le GTPE suit et promeut les « Standards Minimums pour la protection de l’enfance dans l’intervention humanitaire », lancés en 2010 comme outil global guidant les activités de protection de l’enfance. Avec l’appui du GTPE national basé à Kinshasa depuis 2009, il coordonne les stratégies de prévention et de réponse visant à réduire les situations d’abus, de négligence, d’exploitation et de violence, dont sont victimes les enfants dans des contextes d'urgence et de transition, y compris les enfants associés aux groupes armés.

**2. CONTEXTE ET JUSTIFICATION** 

La Province du Tanganyika est restée depuis novembre 2011 le théâtre d’affrontements entre les groupes armés et les forces loyalistes.  

D’une part, des poches d’activisme des groupes armés Mai Mai Yakutumba et Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR) subsistent dans les Hauts Plateaux de Fizi/sud Kivu, zone voisine du Tanganyika où il est sporadiquement jusqu’à ce jour signalé des attaques et actes de violence sur la population civile attribués aux éléments susmentionnés. Cette situation est à la base des mouvements des populations du Sud Kivu vers le territoire de Kalemie, précisément sur les axes Kalemie-Bendera et Kalemie-Kabimba.  

D’autre part, depuis 2014, les conflits intercommunautaires latents entre les Luba et les Twa ont refait surface d’abord dans le territoire de Manono, puis se sont étendus dans le territoire de Nyunzu, puis récemment en 2016 aux territoires de Kabalo ; Kalemie et une partie du territoire de Moba. Ces conflits ont entrainé des mouvements massifs et continus de populations accompagnés de pertes importantes en vies humaines, de graves violations des droits des personnes ainsi que la destruction de nombreuses infrastructures de base.  

Depuis le 12 juillet 2016, le territoire de Nyunzu, ainsi que la plupart des territoires du Tanganyika excepté celui de Kongolo, connaissent une résurgence des affrontements opposant les deux ethnies antagonistes. On assiste à la montée en puissance des conflits accompagnés de violations graves à l’encontre des enfants, notamment l’utilisation des enfants par les milices et les violences sexuelles.  
Ces conflits sont accompagnés de scènes de pillage, d’incendies de maisons et d’écoles et de destructions des réserves agricoles, entraînant des mouvements massifs de populations vers des centres et cités quelque peu sécurisés.

**3. IMPACT DU CONFLIT SUR LA PROTECTION DE L’ENFANT** 

Les enfants du Tanganyika se trouvent ainsi exposés à des risques accrus de violence dans un contexte où la prévalence de la pauvreté se traduit déjà par de nombreux défis de protection tels que, par exemple, la déscolarisation d’un grand nombre d’enfants (64,800 enfants en rupture scolaire pour un total de 367,598 enfants soit 17,6%) ou leur exploitation économique dans les sites miniers. Les analyses découlant des évaluations, monitorings et visites effectuées sur le terrain par des acteurs humanitaires dans les zones affectées par les conflits confirment que la vie, la sécurité et la dignité des enfants dans la province du Tanganyika sont fortement menacées.  

Plusieurs cas de graves violations ont été rapportés et signalés par les partenaires locaux résidant dans les différentes zones affectées par ces conflits. Au 28 février 2017, les acteurs de protection de l’enfant du GTPE ont notamment identifié quelques 2,000 cas d’utilisation d’enfants dans les milices, 397 cas d’enfants non accompagnés ou séparés en besoin de protection, 167 cas d’enfants blessés et plus de 150 cas de violences sexuelles (voir tableau en Annexe 1).  

Ces estimations sont vraisemblablement sous-évaluées notamment en raison de deux défis majeurs, à savoir :

- Le manque de moyens techniques et financiers des acteurs de protection de l’enfant pour conduire des évaluations approfondies et une surveillance (monitoring) régulière permettant une collecte et documentation fiables des données relatives aux cas de protection de l’enfant liés au conflit intercommunautaire;

- Le difficile accès humanitaire aux populations twa, qui résident principalement dans la forêt, entrave l’assistance aux enfants twa affectés par le conflit. Les données rapportées concernent donc majoritairement les enfants bantous, alimentant la perception d’une fourniture partiale de l’aide humanitaire.",268,"French"
2378674,"Note d’information: Journée Internationale des Enfants Soldats 2017 - Définition: Un “enfant associé à une force armée ou à un groupe armé” est toute personne âgée de moins de 18 ans qui est ou a été recrutée ou employée par une force armée ou un groupe armé, quelle que soit la fonction qu’elle y exerce. Il peut s’agir, notamment mais pas exclusivement, d’enfants, filles ou garçons, utilisés comme combattants, cuisiniers, porteurs, messagers, espions ou à des fins sexuelles. Le terme ne désigne pas seulement un enfant qui participe ou a participé directement à des hostilités. » (Principes de Paris1 , 2007).

**I. Progrès en RDC** 

- Cadre normatif: Outre la ratification de la Convention internationale relative aux droits de l’enfant en 1990, de son Protocole facultatif concernant l’implication d’enfants dans les conflits armés en 2001, et du Statut de Rome créant la Cour Pénale Internationale en 2002, la RDC a adopté en 2009 la «Loi portant protection de l'enfant» qui criminalise le recrutement et l'utilisation d'enfants par les forces armées et les groupes armés. En juillet 2016, le Gouvernement a également endossé la Déclaration d'Oslo qui vise à protéger les enfants notamment contre le recrutement dans les écoles. 

- Mise en œuvre: Le Mécanisme des Nations Unies chargé de surveiller les violations graves faites aux enfants dans les conflits armés2 (MRM) existe depuis plus de 10 ans en RDC et continue de documenter les cas de violations graves et de sensibiliser les parties au conflit sur la nécessité de faire cesser et de prévenir ces violations. En 2012, le Gouvernement de la RDC a signé avec les Nations Unies un Plan d'Action pour prévenir et mettre fin au recrutement et à l'utilisation des enfants ainsi qu’aux autres violations graves des droits des enfants commises par les forces de sécurité de l’Etat. Un Groupe de Travail Technique Conjoint (GTTC) composé du Gouvernement et des NU assure la mise en œuvre effective de ce Plan. 

- Plaidoyer, renforcement des capacités et sensibilisation: Le GTTC, avec le soutien de l’UNICEF, de la MONUSCO et d’ONG internationales, contribue notamment à la campagne ‘Des enfants, pas des soldats’, une initiative de la Représentante spéciale du Secrétaire général des NU pour les enfants et les conflits armés. Par ailleurs, des formations sont dispensées aux FARDC et aux acteurs de protection de l’enfant. La participation des enfants est également encouragée, notamment à travers la voix des enfants reporters.

**II. Impact** 

- En application du Plan d’Action, le Gouvernement a pris une série de mesures qui ont conduit, depuis deux ans, à la cessation du recrutement d'enfants par les FARDC. Notamment début 2017, le Gouvernement a donné la directive à tout le personnel des FARDC de respecter la procédure opérationnelle standard adoptée en avril 2016 sur la vérification de l’âge des membres des FARDC. Cette procédure est un outil de prévention du recrutement qui est désormais systématisé à tous les niveaux de l’armée. 

- En 2016, grâce à l'action de l'UNICEF et de ses partenaires, 3 442 enfants (dont 478 filles) ont quitté des groupes armés dans les zones touchées par le conflit, ont bénéficié d’une prise en charge transitoire et ont pu être réunifiés avec leurs familles. En outre, 1274 sortis des groupes armés ont reçu un soutien à la réintégration par l’école, l’accès à une formation professionnelle ou à des activités génératrices de revenus.  

Toutefois il faut noter que, en 2016, faute de ressources suffisantes, plus de 2100 enfants sortis des groupes armés restent en attente de réintégration. A ceux-ci s’ajoute un nombre équivalent d’enfants dits ‘vulnérables’, affectés par le conflit qui, au titre des Principes de Paris, devraient bénéficier du même soutien que les enfants sortis des groupes armés afin que les programmes de réintégration soient inclusifs. Au total, en tenant compte des enfants qui n’ont pas pu recevoir une aide les années précédentes, ce sont plus de 4500 enfants sortis des groupes armés et un nombre équivalent d’enfants touchés par les conflits qui attendent encore une réintégration complète, faute de financement.

**III. Défis** 

- Le recrutement et l'utilisation d'enfants par les groupes armés demeurent un défi majeur, notamment en raison:

- De la multiplication des groupes armés et des milices informelles;

- Des difficultés d'accès à, de dialogue avec et de poursuite des auteurs;

- De l’absence de paix et de l’extension des conflits à des zones non traditionnellement affectées par les conflits. 

- La pauvreté extrême des familles demeure une cause profonde et le principal levier du recrutement forcé et volontaire des enfants. Ce constat appelle de la part du Gouvernement un vaste programme de pacification et de développement économique pour les zones touchées par les conflits. 

- La réintégration durable et la prévention efficace du recrutement sont entravées par:

- Insécurité: La phase de réintégration des programmes DDR mis en œuvre à travers le monde commence habituellement une fois le conflit terminé et les zones de réintégration pacifiées. En RDC, les initiatives de réintégration sont menées dans un contexte marqué par une crise prolongée et un conflit qui perdure.

- Financement à court terme: Le financement de la réintégration des EAFGA provient généralement d'un financement humanitaire qui est souvent de courte durée et ne convient pas pour un accompagnement de 2-3 ans des bénéficiaires. De plus, le choix des programmes socio-économiques de réintégration reste limité (en particulier pour les filles) et manquent de soutien à long terme au développement des capacités de gestion de l’enfant bénéficiaire.

**V. Le Groupe de Travail sur la Protection de l’Enfance (GTPE)** 

- Le GTPE est le forum chargé de la coordination des actions concernant la protection de l’enfant dans les situations d’urgence, sous la direction de l’UNICEF et la co-direction du Gouvernement et de Save The Children. Constituant un « domaine de responsabilité» du Cluster Protection, il réunit Ministère des Affaires Sociales, Action Humanitaire et Solidarité Nationale, organisations non-gouvernementales (internationales et nationales), agences des Nations Unies, et bailleurs de fonds directement impliqués dans des projets de protection de l'enfance en situation d'urgence avec l’objectif de garantir des interventions plus prévisibles, responsables et efficaces. Pour ce faire, le GTPE suit et promeut les « Standards Minimums pour la protection de l’enfance dans l’intervention humanitaire », lancés en 2010 comme outil global guidant les activités de protection de l’enfance. En RDC depuis 2009, le GTPE national, basé à Kinshasa, en étroite collaboration avec les 18 GTPE sous-nationaux, coordonne les stratégies de prévention et de réponse visant à réduire les situations d’abus, de négligence, d’exploitation et de violence, dont sont victimes les enfants dans des contextes d'urgence et de transition, y compris les enfants associés aux groupes armés. 

- La problématique des enfants associés aux groupes armés s’inscrit dans un panorama de problématiques de protection plus larges et plus complexes dans un pays où, de façon presque inaperçue, le nombre des personnes déplacées internes est passé de 1,6 à 2,1 millions et le nombre de groupes armés de 50 à 704 . La réponse aux multiples besoins de protection des enfants dans ce contexte nécessite la mobilisation de plus d’intervenants étatiques et non étatiques, internationaux comme nationaux. C’est à ce besoin que le Groupe de Travail sur la Protection de l’Enfance (GTPE) s’efforce de répondre.",268,"French"

P.I. Associate, UNHCR Goré

**Doba, 15 décembre 2017 (UNHCR)** – Une mission inter-agences des Nations Unies composée du HCR, du PAM, de l’UNICEF et de OCHA a rencontré les autorités administratives et les responsables des services déconcentrés de l’Etat des régions du Logone Oriental et du Moyen Chari les 12 et 13 décembre 2017. 

Cette mission avait pour but de leur présenter le contenu du projet financé par le CERF (Fonds des Nations Unies pour les Réponses d’Urgence) et de solliciter leur appui et leur implication pour la réussite de cette intervention. 

Le financement CERF obtenu par la FAO, le HCR, le PAM, l’UNFPA et l’UNICEF avec l’appui de OCHA vise à apporter une assistance intégrée aux populations vulnérables en vue de contribuer à leur autonomisation. C’est un projet de transfert monétaire non conditionnel, non restrictif et à usage multiple. Cette assistance au profit de 11.268 ménages soit 41.393 individus (sélectionnés sur la base de leur vulnérabilité) couvrira deux camps de réfugiés (Doholo et Belom) et trois sites de retournés (Kobitey, Danamadja et Maiganga) sur une période de 7 mois allant de décembre 2017 à juin 2018. 

L’argent couvrira l’achat de produits alimentaires, la santé, l’achat de produits désinfectant (eau de javel, savon), la mise en œuvre d’activités pour renforcer leur moyen d’existence (élevage, cultures maraichères) et la réhabilitation de leurs abris. Au-delà des bienfaits de ce projet pour les bénéficiaires, il y a lieu de relever son impact socio-économique pour les fournisseurs locaux.

Partout où la mission est passée, elle a eu l’adhésion totale des autorités administratives et des responsables des services déconcentrés de l’Etat. Félicitant l’initiative de ce projet pilote, le Secrétaire Général de la Région du Logone Oriental, M. Adam Adami Youssouf, a encouragé les agences porteuses de ce projet : «vous avez notre soutien total pour votre initiative. Je vous souhaite pleins succès pour cette œuvre salutaire. Nous serons présents pour vous appuyer».

Ce projet pilote s’inscrit dans la dynamique d’autonomisation des bénéficiaires. M. Jerome Merlin, Administrateur Principal Chargé de la Protection à la Sous-Délégation du HCR à Goré  indique qu’il s’agit de «passer de la phase de réponse humanitaire à la phase de pré-développement ». Selon lui, « L’assistance par l’intervention monétaire, qui n’est pas une activité en soit, mais un moyen de mener des activités, entre dans le processus de responsabilisation des ménages,  nécessaire et intrinsèquement liée à l’autonomisation des ménages. Le principe de ""non conditionnalité"" rendra davantage responsable ces bénéficiaires et participera à leur autonomisation». 

A travers ce projet financé par le CERF, la FAO, le HCR, le PAM, l’UNFPA et l’UNICEF travailleront en étroite synergie, chaque agence en assurant un leadership dans son secteur de responsabilité, sur fond de coopération et coordination.",268,"French"
2378399,"Aide alimentaire française : un bilan 2017 significatif Au cours de l’année 2017, la France a mobilisé en Haïti près d’1,7 millions d’euros d’aide alimentaire dont 1,5M€ ont été reversé au Comité Interministériel d’Aide Alimentaire (CIAA) en réponse à l’ouragan Matthew du 3 au 4 octobre 2016. L’Ambassade de France continue également d’appuyer le Programme National des Cantines Scolaires (PNCS).

Ces crédits ont notamment permis de réaliser des actions significatives telles que :

- L’achat et la distribution de 932 tonnes de produits locaux (824 tonnes de céréales et 108 tonnes de légumineuses) auprès de quatre organisations de producteurs (2 dans le département de l’Artibonite et 2 dans le département du Nord). 720 tonnes ont déjà livrées au PNCS, 12 tonnes à la fondation Centre d’appui à la jeunesse (CEDAJ) associant le sport et l’éducation scolaire et 200 tonnes, en préparation, seront directement acheminés au premier trimestre de l’année 2018 aux établissements scolaires du réseau d’alimentation scolaire du PNCS et encadrés par des opérateurs français œuvrant dans le système haïtien de l’éducation. Cette contribution a permis d’assurer la couverture en besoins d’alimentation scolaire de 55 000 enfants du cycle fondamental sur une période de 110 jours scolaires.

- La relance des activités économiques et le renforcement des initiatives locales en milieu rural dans les régions sévèrement touchées par l’ouragan Matthew - via un appel à projets permettant de financer 14 projets d’OSC haïtiennes en milieu rural dans la péninsule Sud d’Haïti (Sud, Nippes et Grand’Anse). Cet appel portait sur cinq thématiques clés :

1. La production végétale et/ou le développement de l’arboriculture,

2. La production de semences de bonne qualité,

3. L’élevage,

2378394,"Sankuru : l’adduction d’eau potable fait la joie des Grands Séminaristes et villageois de Shapembe Lodja, le 14 décembre 2017 (caritasdev.cd) : l’approvisionnement régulier du Grand séminaire Saint Jean Paul II de Lodja en eau potable, sans perturber son organisation en saison sèche ainsi que l’amélioration de l’état de santé des enfants du village Shapembe et la baisse sensible de taux des maladies hydriques et des mains sales, sont respectivement les impacts direct et indirect d’un microprojet réalisé par la Caritas-Développement Tshumbe, dans la Province du Sankuru.

Intitulé « Adduction d’eau potable dans le village SHAPEMBE», ce microprojet a été financé par la Caritas Italiana, avec une enveloppe de 5.000 dollars US, grâce au plaidoyer de la Caritas Congo Asbl. Il a été exécuté de janvier en avril 2017. Au-delà de l’enveloppe susmentionnée, ce microprojet a été réalisé grâce aussi à la contribution locale, évaluée à 3.138 dollars américains. Ses bénéficiaires directs sont les formateurs et les étudiants futurs prêtres du Grand séminaire Saint Jean Paul II de Lodja, évalués à environ 80 personnes. Les bénéficiaires indirects sont les habitants du village Shapembe, environ 1.500 personnes, renseigne Monsieur l’Abbé François PONGO LOWANGA, Recteur du Grand Séminaire Saint Jean Paul II de Lodja et Responsable du microprojet.

« De même, l’impact de ce projet est remarquable dans les mœurs des jeunes filles du village. A l’époque, celles-ci trainaient trop dehors pour de raison de descente à la rivière pour chercher de l’eau, avec risques de viol et d’agression par des jeunes garçons inciviques », ajoute le prêtre, dans un rapport daté de juillet dernier. 

Pour atteindre ces résultats, il a fallu acheter une pompe manuelle de marque Vergnet HPV 100 (en février 2017), faire réaliser les travaux de forage proprement dits par une entreprise locale et l’installer. Deux mois plus tard, le Grand Séminaire Saint Paul II et le village étaient approvisionnés en eau potable. Le projet avait aussi procédé à la sensibilisation de la population environnant du Grand séminaire Saint Jean-Paul II de Lodja sur le bien-fondé du forage d’eau potable ainsi que la protection consciencieuse de cet ouvrage.

On trouvera ci-après le message du Secrétaire général de l’ONU, M. António Guterres, à l’occasion de la Journée internationale des migrants célébrée le 18 décembre:

La Journée internationale des migrants est l’occasion pour nous de reconnaître les contributions qu’apportent les 258 millions de migrants de par le monde et d’en célébrer la vitalité.

Les preuves ne manquent pas pour montrer que les migrants produisent des avantages économiques, sociaux et culturels pour toutes les sociétés. Et pourtant, l’hostilité envers les migrants ne fait, hélas, que croître à travers le monde. Il est, plus que jamais, urgent de faire preuve de solidarité avec les migrants.

Les migrations ont toujours existé: depuis les temps immémoriaux, les êtres humains se sont déplacés, en quête de nouveaux débouchés et d’une vie meilleure. Et elles continueront d’exister, à cause des changements climatiques, de l’évolution démographique, de l’instabilité, de l’aggravation des inégalités, des besoins des marchés du travail et de la recherche de meilleures conditions de vie. 

Il nous faut une coopération internationale effective qui permette d’encadrer les migrations de sorte que les bénéfices qu’elles apportent soient plus largement répartis et que les droits fondamentaux de toutes les personnes concernées soient protégés – comme le préconise le Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030.

L’an dernier, les dirigeants mondiaux se sont engagés à conclure un pacte mondial pour des migrations sûres, ordonnées et régulières à l’horizon 2018. Tournés vers l’avenir, œuvrons à la réalisation de cet objectif pour tous.

2378384,"Le HCR se félicite des nouvelles lois de Djibouti pour les réfugiés *Ceci est un résumé des déclarations du porte-parole du HCR Adrian Edwards – à qui toute citation peut être attribuée – lors de la conférence de presse du 12 décembre 2017 au Palais des Nations à Genève.*

Le HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés, se félicite de l’entrée en vigueur de nouvelles lois sur les réfugiés à Djibouti, qui rationalisent les procédures de détermination du statut de réfugié et leur assurent davantage d’opportunités pour leur intégration socio-économique.

La signature de deux décrets, le jeudi 7 décembre par Ismail Omar Guelleh, Président de Djibouti, marque l’entrée en vigueur de ces nouvelles lois, qui facilitent également l’accès aux services sociaux tels que les services de santé, l’éducation et des opportunités d’emploi.

Ces nouveaux développements faisaient partie des engagements pris par le Président au cours du Sommet des dirigeants de l’année dernière, à la suite de l’adoption de la Déclaration de New York pour les réfugiés et les migrants, en septembre 2016. Ces changements font aussi partie de l’application du Cadre d’action global pour les réfugiés (CRRF), énoncé dans la Déclaration et qui vise à améliorer l’autonomie des réfugiés et leur inclusion, accompagnée d’un soutien accru pour les communautés d’accueil.

Jusqu’à présent, l’accès des réfugiés aux soins de santé était essentiellement assuré par les organisations internationales non gouvernementales, leurs possibilités d’emploi étaient limitées au secteur informel où ils travaillaient comme domestiques, pêcheurs, employés dans des restaurants ou manœuvres.

Cette évolution fait suite à un accord entre le Gouvernement et le HCR en août cette année, pour assurer une éducation de qualité pour tous les enfants réfugiés, en les incluant dans le système scolaire national.

Cette semaine, Djibouti est également l’hôte d’une conférence régionale sur l’amélioration de l’éducation pour les réfugiés, aligné avec le Cadre d’action global pour les réfugiés (CRRF).

Le pays, qui a une longue tradition d’accueil des réfugiés, héberge actuellement plus de 27 000 d’entre eux, pour la plupart originaires d’Éthiopie, d’Érythrée, de Somalie, et plus récemment du Yémen.

2378379,"Le HCR évacue 74 réfugiés vulnérables depuis la Libye vers le Niger Le HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés, a évacué, dans la nuit du 14 au 15 décembre, 74 réfugiés vulnérables – en grande majorité des enfants et des femmes – depuis la Libye vers le Niger.

« Je suis heureux d’annoncer qu’un groupe de 51 enfants, 22 femmes et un homme a été évacué avec succès depuis la Libye et qu’ils se trouvent désormais en sécurité au Niger. Il y a moins de 24 heures, ils étaient encore détenus en Libye mais ils peuvent maintenant se remettre à espérer », a déclaré Vincent Cochetel, Envoyé spécial du HCR pour la situation en Méditerranée centrale.

« Cette évacuation n’aurait pas pu s’effectuer sans le soutien des autorités et de nos partenaires en Libye, y compris le MOAS. Je tiens également à saluer l’extraordinaire solidarité manifestée par le peuple et le Gouvernement nigériens », a-t-il ajouté.

Avec l’appui des partenaires du HCR au Niger, ces réfugiés - de nationalité érythréenne ou somalienne - seront hébergés dans des maisons d’hôtes à Niamey. Les enfants seront accueillis dans des centres pour enfants, où ils pourront recevoir de l’aide et un soutien psychosocial. Des activités récréatives seront également organisées pour eux. La meilleure solution dans l’intérêt de chaque enfant sera identifiée, alors que les adultes suivront la procédure courante du HCR pour la réinstallation et d’autres solutions durables.

Parallèlement, le premier groupe des 25 réfugiés - qui avaient été évacués depuis la Libye vers le Niger le 11 novembre dernier - devrait rejoindre la France avant Noël.

Lundi, le HCR avait lancé un [appel urgent demandant la mise à disposition de 1 300 places de réinstallation](http://www.unhcr.org/fr/news/press/2017/12/5a2e78180/hcr-recherche-1-300-places-reinstallation-durgence-refugies-vulnerables.html) pour des réfugiés vulnérables en Libye d'ici la fin mars 2018.

« Les évacuations de réfugiés ne doivent s’inscrire que dans le cadre d’efforts accrus pour la gestion des migrations et le renforcement des capacités en matière d’asile visant à répondre aux mouvements complexes de migrants et de réfugiés le long des itinéraires méditerranéens », a souligné Vincent Cochetel. Le HCR est reconnaissant du soutien de la Commission européenne pour mettre en oeuvre ce mécanisme d’évacuation qui sauve des vies humaines.

2378374,"République centrafricaine : le Comité des sanctions du Conseil de sécurité se réunit avec son Groupe d’experts et s’informe sur la gestion des armes et des munitions SC/13123

On trouvera ci-après le texte de la déclaration à la presse faite, aujourd’hui, par le Président du Conseil de sécurité pour le mois de décembre, M. Koro Bessho (Japon):

Le 4 décembre 2017, le Comité du Conseil de sécurité créé en application de la résolution [2127 (2013)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2127(2013)) concernant la République Centrafricaine a tenu des consultations au sujet du rapport final du Groupe d’experts, présenté en application du paragraphe 28 c) de la résolution [2339 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2339(2017)).

Le Groupe d’experts a présenté les principales constatations et recommandations décrites en détail dans son rapport. Il a fait observer que la situation en matière de sécurité, notamment dans le sud-est et le nord-ouest du pays, était toujours instable et qu’aucun véritable progrès concernant le processus politique n’avait été réalisé au cours de la période considérée. Il a insisté sur le fait que les « groupes d’autodéfense », qui sont plus ou moins liés à certains membres du mouvement antibalaka, ont continué de poursuivre leur objectif de « libérer » le sud-est de la République Centrafricaine et de prendre spécifiquement pour cibles les Musulmans et les soldats de la paix. Leurs attaques étaient alimentées par des discours antimusulmans et anti-MINUSCA inflammatoires dont les instigateurs se trouvaient à Bangui.

Le Groupe a observé que les rapports entre les diverses factions ex-Séléka avaient évolué après la signature de l’accord d’Ippy le 9 octobre 2017, qui s’était traduit par la fin des affrontements intra-Séléka, la liberté de circulation sur l’axe Bria-Bambari et la réouverture des couloirs de transhumance. Il a également insisté sur le fait que les groupes antibalaka et les groupes d’autodéfense autoproclamés avaient repris à l’union pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC) le contrôle des voies utilisées pour le trafic d’armes à Bema, au sud-est de Bangassou à la frontière avec la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), tandis que dans le nord du pays, les activités de trafic d’armes menées par les factions ex-Séléka avaient temporairement ralenti en raison de l’arrivée de la saison des pluies.

Les délégations ont insisté sur le fait que les États de la région devaient coopérer plus étroitement contre le trafic d’armes et se sont déclarés préoccupés par l’état de l’application de l’interdiction de voyager par les États de la région. Elles ont également rappelé qu’il importait que les autorités de la République Centrafricaine gèlent les avoir des ressortissants centrafricains inscrits sur la Liste.

Le Comité a également entendu une déclaration du Service de la lutte antimines lors de laquelle le représentant du Service a fait le point de l’action menée en République Centrafricaine depuis la précédente intervention devant le Comité, en mai 2017. Le Service a continué de fournir des conseils techniques et d’apporter son expertise aux autorités de la République Centrafricaine, de construire et de réhabiliter des installations de stockage d’armes et de munitions et, en coopération avec l’institut des Nations Unies pour la recherche sur le désarmement (UNIDIR), de les aider à appliquer la feuille de route pour la période 2017 - 2018 concernant les armes légères et de petit calibre qui doit déboucher sur une stratégie et un plan d’action nationaux. À l’occasion de son intervention, qui était la première devant le Comité, le représentant de l’UNIDIR a fait part des premières constatations de l’étude sur la gestion des armes et des munitions en République Centrafricaine, qui fera l’objet d’un rapport publié début 2018.

Les membres du Comité ont remercié le Service de la lutte antimines et l’UNIDIR pour leurs interventions. Plusieurs membres ont accueilli avec satisfaction le rapport final du Groupe d’experts, observant que les travaux du Groupe en faveur de la paix et de la sécurité, y compris la surveillance de l’incitation à la violence par des groupes armés, des dirigeants politiques, religieux et des représentants de la société civile en République Centrafricaine, étaient importants. Plusieurs membres du Comité ont également rappelé qu’il importait que les membres du Groupe d’experts puissent s’acquitter en toute sécurité de leur mandat, énoncé aux paragraphes 27 et 28 de la résolution [2339 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2339(2017)).

2378369,"Le GARR s'adresse aux Parlementaires haïtiens **Lettre ouverte adressée aux Parlementaires haïtiens autour de la nécessité de ratifier la Convention Internationale sur la Protection des Droits de tous les travailleurs migrants et des membres de leurs familles**

Honorable parlementaires,

A l’occasion de la Journée Internationale des Migrants, célébrée le 18 décembre de chaque année, le GARR entend attirer votre attention sur la nécessité pour le Parlement haïtien de ratifier la Convention internationale sur la Protection des droits de tous les travailleurs migrants et des membres de leurs familles, adoptée par l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies le 18 décembre 1990 dans sa résolution 45/158. En effet, l’institution de promotion et de défense des droits des migrants salue le premier pas déjà fait par Haïti avec la signature de cette Convention en décembre 2013. Il croit qu’il serait opportun pour le pays d’achever le processus en la ratifiant. Ce qui rendra effective la volonté d’avoir un cadre protecteur en faveur des migrants.

 Aujourd’hui, Haïti est un pays d’émigrants. Mis à part les déplacements de populations internes qui sont en constante évolution pour de multiples raisons, l’émigration haïtienne prend une ampleur surprenante. Une bonne partie de la population vit à l’extérieur ; les estimations se chiffrent à plus de trois millions d’Haïtiens. Certains se retrouvent dans des pays d’accueil où le racisme et la xénophobie sont très marqués et se traduisent en des actes d’abus, de cruauté et de discrimination. Les femmes et les enfants sont encore plus exposés dans les mouvements migratoires, non seulement par ce qu’ils/elles sont des étrangers mais aussi à cause de leur sexe ou de leur âge. Les activités de monitoring du GARR au niveau de la frontière haïtiano-dominicaine montrent que ces deux groupes- quoiqu’en nombre inférieur par rapport aux hommes, ont vécu des expériences qui affectent à jamais leur corps et leur esprit. De janvier au 13 décembre 2017, le GARR a enregistré 31 cas emblématiques de violations à l’encontre des migrantes et migrants haïtiens dont 7 cas d’assassinat. Les 24 autres se réfèrent à des sévices corporels. Les pays concernés sont la République Dominicaine, le Brésil et le Chili.

 La protection des droits et de la dignité des migrants et migrantes haïtiens est au centre des préoccupations des institutions de droits humains qui accompagnent les personnes migrantes. La ratification de la convention leur donnera un argument crucial dans les actions de plaidoyer auprès des Etats qui sont les principaux récepteurs de migrantes et de migrants haïtiens, notamment la République Dominicaine.

Honorables parlementaires, le GARR estime que la Convention de 1990 fournit un cadre juridique international qui permet d’analyser et d’orienter les politiques migratoires. Avec un tel instrument, l’Etat haïtien pourra entreprendre des pourparlers avec ses homologues étrangers pour d’éventuelles coopérations. Il sera en mesure d’établir de manière proactive des accords bilatéraux en matière de migration de travail et prévenir d’autres phénomènes tels que la migration irrégulière, le trafic et la traite de personnes.

De nouvelles tendances émergent et présentent un tableau sombre du parcours migratoire des ressortissantes et ressortissants haïtiens qui utilisent les pays de l’Amérique latine comme zone de transit et de destination. Même s’il est actuellement difficile de donner des chiffres par rapport au nombre de migrants haïtiens irréguliers, les observations des organisations montrent l’urgente nécessité de faire face à ce phénomène.

La ratification de la Convention facilitera également la garantie des mesures de protection en faveur des immigrantes et immigrants qui sont sur le territoire national. Le GARR reçoit régulièrement des personnes de nationalité étrangère notamment des Dominicains, des Nigérians, des Cubains, des Colombiens, pour ne citer que ceux-là, qui nécessitent de la protection et de l’accompagnement. Etant un pays ouvert, Haïti renforcera son cadre de protection en adaptant les lois nationales sur la migration aux prescrits de la Convention.

Le GARR en tant qu’institution qui s’investit depuis plus de 26 ans dans la promotion et la défense des droits des migrants, vous invite, Honorables parlementaires, à affirmer votre engagement unanime par rapport aux valeurs substantielles partagées et reconnues, qui sont inscrites dans la Convention, en faveur de tous les hommes et les femmes même en étant des Travailleurs migrants.

Tout en vous souhaitant de joyeuses fêtes de fin d'année 2017, le GARR vous prie d’agréer, Honorables parlementaires, ses salutations patriotiques.

2378254,"Communiqué Conjoint de la condamnation historique par la République démocratique du Congo pour crimes contre l'humanité pour le viol d'enfants à Kavumu **New York, 15 décembre 2017** - Les Représentantes spéciales du Secrétaire général de l’ONU chargée des violences sexuelles commises en période de conflit, Madame Pramila Patten, et pour les enfants et les conflits armés, Madame Virginia Gamba, saluent la justice militaire de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC) pour la décision historique de condamner un parlementaire local et des membres de la milice « Armée de Jésus » pour le viol de dizaines d’enfants à Kavumu, RDC. Ces crimes ont été commis d’une façon systématique entre 2013-2016 dans une ville de la province du Sud-Kivu.

« Les enfants survivants des violences sexuelles à Kavumu, leur famille, et communauté ont démontré un énorme courage pendant le procès, » a déclaré la Représentante spéciale Patten. « Je rends hommage à leur courage et j’espère que le jugement d’aujourd’hui leur rend justice. » Elle a notamment souligné que « le jugement et l’emprisonnement à vie par la justice militaire franchissent ainsi une étape cruciale pour mettre fin à l’impunité des auteurs des violences sexuelles en RDC. »

Les Représentantes spéciales Patten et Gamba félicitent également la société civile pour leur rôle. « Ce cas démontre qu’avec une volonté politique, des représentants du Gouvernement bien entrainés, la participation de la société civile et une presse engagée, justice peut être rendue dans les cas de violence sexuelle, » a noté la Représentante spéciale Gamba. « Je me réjouis que l’Equipe d’Experts des Nations Unies sur l’Etat de Droit et les Violences Sexuelles dans les Conflits ait pu être déployée pour soutenir les autorités nationales dans le système militaire de justice pour s’assurer que le cas de Kavumu soit priorisé conformément au Communiqué Conjoint signé par mon Bureau et le Gouvernement congolais en 2013, » la Représentante spéciale Patten a ajouté.

« Le viol et les autres formes de violences sexuelles contre les enfants restent malheureusement répandus en RDC et six partis figurent sur les listes du dernier Rapport du Secrétaire général sur le sort des enfants en temps de conflit armé pour cette violation grave. Cette condamnation apporte de l’espoir à toutes les autres victimes de violence sexuelle », a indiqué la Représentante spéciale Gamba. » Néanmoins, bien que le procès soit conclu, le processus judiciaire n’est pas encore terminé, » ont rappelé les deux Représentantes spéciales. « Ces jugements de réparations susceptibles de changer la vie des enfants victimes de violences sexuelles doivent être payés en entier et la condamnation des auteurs de ces violences doit être exécutée pour que justice soit pleinement rendue. »

Les Représentantes spéciales Patten et Gamba exhortent « la communauté internationale à travailler avec le Gouvernement congolais afin de garantir que des ressources soient disponibles pour le paiement de réparations aux survivantes et aux autres victimes des atrocités de Kavamu. »

En plus, un foyer de choléra a été répertorié dans le département du Nord-Ouest où 157 cas ont été enregistrés, montrant une petite remontée de l’épidémie vers le nord du pays. Malgré cela, de janvier à novembre 2017, le pays a enregistré un total de 12 990 cas suspects de choléra et 141 décès, soit une baisse respective de 67 % et de 66 % en comparaison à la même période en 2016.  

Des efforts soutenus se poursuivent dans tous les départements du pays où les 57 équipes mobiles supportées par l’UNICEF, en partenariat avec les Equipes Mobiles d’Intervention Rapide (EMIRA) du Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population (MSPP) et les techniciens du département de réponse aux urgences de la Direction Nationale de l’Eau Potable et de l’Assainissement (DINEPA) interviennent rapidement pour empêcher la transmission de la maladie dans les communautés touchées. Au niveau institutionnel, l’OPS/OMS, avec les partenaires santé, apportent un appui à la coordination et au renforcement de la prise en charge sur le terrain dans les zones de flambée.  

Cependant, les faiblesses du système de santé, le faible accès à l’eau et à l’assainissement des populations, ainsi que le manque de financement risquent de compromettre les efforts fournis par l’ensemble des acteurs engagés dans la lutte contre le choléra.

La RCA est actuellement le théâtre d’une des crises humanitaires les plus graves au monde : plus d’une personne sur deux a besoin d’aide humanitaire pour survivre et prêt d’une personne sur quatre est soit déplacée soit réfugiée. L’amplitude et la sévérité des besoins atteint en 2017 rappelle la situation qui a mené à la crise de 2013-2014. L’impact des déplacements répétés et sur de plus longues durées crée un effet domino qui plonge les communautés, déjà affaiblies par les multiples cycles de conflit au cours des dernières années, dans la crise humanitaire.  

Face à une situation de sous-développement chronique, dans laquelle plus de 2.5 millions de personnes ont des besoins critiques dans tous les secteurs, les acteurs humanitaires proposent d’articuler les besoins prioritaires à couvrir autour de trois grandes catégories :

**1. 589 000 PERSONNES ONT DES BESOINS CRITIQUES ET IMMÉDIATS DU À UN CHOC HUMANITAIRE** 

Les populations affectées par un choc humanitaire sur le court terme, qu’il soit d’origine sécuritaire, sanitaire ou suite à une catastrophe naturelle et qui constitue une menace grave pour la vie, l’intégrité physique, la santé et le bien-être des personnes. Les personnes affectées ont besoin de protection et d’une assistance d’urgence, immédiate et adaptée couvrant leurs besoins essentiels pour sauver la vie tout en préservant la sécurité et la dignité.

**2. 1 699 000 PERSONNES ONT DES BESOINS AIGUS LIÉS À LEURS VULNÉRABILITÉS CHRONIQUES**

Les populations affectées par une situation d’urgence chronique, qui est une situation de risque et de vulnérabilité qui affecte une population sur le moyen terme. Cette situation, résultant ou non d’un choc humanitaire antérieur, engendre des besoins humanitaires aigus. 

En l’absence des services essentiels de l’Etat, les personnes les plus vulnérables ont des besoins humanitaires de base qui s’inscrivent sur la durée.

**3. 262 000 PERSONNES ONT DES BESOINS D’APPUI AU RETOUR, INTÉGRATION ET RÉINSTALLATION**

Les populations affectées par les déplacements et les chocs humanitaires ont besoin d’un appui au retour, à l’intégration ou la réinstallation et d’accroître leurs capacités de résilience.

2377509,"Tchad : Ni la pauvreté ni la culture ne devraient être des excuses pour justifier la discrimination contre les femmes N’DJAMENA (14 décembre 2017) – Un groupe d'expertes des Nations Unies sur la discrimination à l'égard des femmes s'est félicité de l'élaboration de lois clefs visant à protéger les femmes au Tchad, mais a mis en garde contre les obstacles persistants dans la quête de la pleine égalité des femmes. 

"" Le Tchad dispose d'un solide cadre constitutionnel pour l'égalité qui inclut l'obligation de l'Etat d'éliminer toutes les formes de discrimination à l'égard des femmes. Le pays a accompli des progrès dans la réalisation du droit des femmes à l'égalité en dépit d’un environnement socio-économique fragile "", a déclaré le Groupe d'expertes des Nations Unies sur la question de la discrimination à l'égard des femmes dans la législation et dans la pratique, à l'issue d'une visite officielle dans le pays.   
   
Les expertes des droits de l'homme des Nations Unies, Alda Facio, qui dirige actuellement le groupe d'experts, et Meskerem Geset Techane ont déclaré : "" Le Tchad a pris les mesures législatives nécessaires pour interdire les mutilations génitales féminines et le mariage des enfants. Malheureusement, ces lois n'auront un impact positif sur la vie des filles tchadiennes que si elles sont pleinement appliquées. Malgré quelques progrès dans la réduction de la prévalence des MGF, les femmes et les filles continuent d'être torturées au travers de cette pratique horrifiante et les filles sont mariées, parfois de force, dès leur puberté. ""

Malgré les améliorations notées dans la participation des femmes à la vie politique et publique, le groupe d'expertes regrette qu’il y ait seulement 28 femmes parlementaires sur 188, plaçant ainsi le Tchad au 140è rang mondial sur 193 pays. Le Gouvernement compte uniquement 4 ministres sur 28, et aucune femme actuellement parmi les 23 gouverneurs.

Les expertes ont noté que les femmes rurales ne sont souvent associées à aucune prise de décision et souffrent d'une exclusion accrue dans tous les domaines de leur vie.  

"" Nous sommes profondément préoccupées par le fait qu’en dépit de la loi qui prévoit des droits de succession égaux et le droit de posséder des terres, la pratique est très différente "", ont-elles déclaré. "" La plupart des femmes n'héritent et ne possèdent pas de terres. Dans certains cas, elles ont une utilisation partielle de la terre mais ne jouissent pas de leur droit à la propriété. Les veuves sont même parfois expulsées de leur terre par leur belle famille. Étant donné que la majeure partie de l'économie dépend de l'agriculture, l'accès limité des femmes à la terre entrave leur autonomisation et leur indépendance. "" 

Les expertes ont également souligné que la pauvreté n'explique pas l'accès limité des filles à l'éducation. "" Ce qui explique cela, ce sont les rôles attribués aux femmes, les mythes et les stéréotypes de genre profondément enracinés "", ont-elles dit.  "" On s'attend à ce que les garçons finissent par prendre soin de leur propre famille tandis que les filles deviendront la possession d’une autre famille par le mariage, perpétuant ainsi la discrimination globale contre les femmes. ""    
   
Le groupe a déclaré qu'il était choqué par la prévalence de la violence sexuelle, y compris les viols contre des filles très jeunes, et l'impunité généralisée dont jouissent les auteurs. Bien que la stigmatisation et le silence imposé aux victimes contribuent à cette impunité, les efforts de réconciliation pour maintenir l'unité et l’honneur de la famille et la non-application de la loi par les agents de l'État en sont la principale cause, selon les expertes.   

Les experts ont également déclaré que l'accès limité à la justice pour les femmes constituait un obstacle supplémentaire à la réalisation de leurs droits. Certains de nos interlocuteurs se sont plaints des interventions extérieures en faveur de personnes détenues pour des actes de violence contre les femmes, conduisant à la libération des auteurs. Nous sommes également perturbées par le grand nombre de femmes en détention provisoire depuis parfois plusieurs années et ce sans procédure équitable.

Le Groupe d'expertes des Nations Unies s'est dit consterné par la mortalité maternelle dans le pays qui est une des plus haute au monde (856 pour 100 000 naissances vivantes), résultant de faiblesses structurelles et de pressions basées sur une interprétation néfaste de la culture, tel qu’en témoigne la nécessité d'obtenir la permission des maris et pères, même avant une césarienne d'urgence ou pour l'utilisation de contraceptifs.  

Cette problématique est exacerbée par le fait que le Tchad a une loi restrictive qui ne permet pas aux médecins de procéder à l’interruption de la grossesse en cas de viol, même pour des mineurs. Les taux élevés de violences sexuelles et l’existence d'avortements clandestins impliquent un risque majeur pour la vie des filles et des femmes, ont ajouté les expertes.

"" Nous avons si souvent entendu parler du joug de la pauvreté et de la "" culture "", mais aucun de ceux-ci ne devrait justifier l'oppression subie par toutes les femmes au Tchad "", ont dit les expertes. "" Nous espérons que le Gouvernement poursuivra ses efforts sur la voie de l'autonomisation des femmes "".

2376819,"La situation nutritionnelle au Tchad appelle à un engagement renouvelé du Gouvernement et de l'ensemble des partenaires **(N’Djamena, 14 décembre 2017)**: La présentation des résultats de l’enquête nationale de nutrition
2017 indique une augmentation de la prévalence de la malnutrition aiguë dans certaines régions du
pays. Selon le Ministère de la Santé Publique, malgré les efforts en cours par le Gouvernement et ses
partenaires, la prévalence de la malnutrition aigüe est à la hausse, et la situation risque de se
dégrader davantage en 2018 sans une prise de conscience de la magnitude du problème par
l’ensemble des acteurs concernés. En effet, le taux de malnutrition aigüe globale (MAG) pour le pays
est de 13,9%, soit deux points de plus que celui de 2016 ; il dépasse le seuil d’urgence de 15% dans
12 régions, majoritairement situées dans la bande sahélienne, sur les 23 régions que compte le
Tchad. La malnutrition aigüe sévère (MAS) est à 3,9%, un taux supérieur au seuil d’urgence de 2%
contre un taux de 2,6% en 2016.

Selon le Système des Nations Unies, il est important de comprendre que la malnutrition n’est pas
qu’une problématique humanitaire. Elle est causée par une conjonction de facteurs structurels et
conjoncturels, et a des implications sur le développement à long terme des individus et du pays. Au
niveau humain, il est prouvé que la malnutrition durant les 1 000 premiers jours de vie limite le
développement du cerveau de l’enfant et affecte ses capacités intellectuelles et cognitives tout au
long de sa vie. Une récente étude sur le coût de la faim au Tchad a par ailleurs démontré les effets
néfastes de la sous-nutrition sur la santé, les capacités d’apprentissage et la productivité des
personnes, le tout ayant un impact sur l’économie nationale. Chaque année, le Tchad perd 9,5% de
son PIB à cause de la sous-nutrition chez l’enfant, soit plus de 575 milliards de FCFA en 2012.
L’absence ou l’insuffisance de réponse à la crise nutritionnelle aura des conséquences certaines pour
l’atteinte des Objectifs de Développement Durable et de la Vision 2030.

La crise alimentaire et nutritionnelle est une des trois crises humanitaires majeures auxquelles le
Tchad est confronté. Au Tchad, la Direction générale de la Commission européenne pour la protection
civile et les opérations d’aide humanitaire (DG ECHO) est fortement impliquée dans la réponse à la
crise nutritionnelle, soutenant tous les partenaires présents au Tchad à hauteur de 24 millions d’euros
en 2017. L’objectif en nutrition est de contribuer à assurer des actions curatives et préventives dans
des zones à forte prévalence. Au-delà de l’action curative pour le traitement de la malnutrition aiguë
sévère chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans, ECHO contribue également à la santé de la mère et de
l’enfant avec un paquet minimum d’activités préventives s’inscrivant dans la stratégie des 1 000
jours. Cependant, la réponse humanitaire seule ne peut résoudre durablement la crise. Il est
nécessaire que les acteurs de développement investissent davantage dans les causes profondes de
cette crise nutritionnelle structurelle, à l’image de l’Union européenne via le Fonds Européen de
Développement, qui ciblera cinq régions à partir de 2018. La lutte contre la malnutrition passe par le
renforcement des structures sanitaires, l’accès durable à l’eau potable et aux infrastructures d’assainissement, ou encore la sensibilisation communautaire pour l’abandon des pratiques
traditionnelles néfastes pour la santé des enfants et l’adoption de bonnes pratiques d’hygiène et
nutritionnelle.

L’ONG Alima, qui appuie notamment l’unité nutritionnelle de l’hôpital de l’amitié sino-tchadienne et
celle de l’hôpital de la mère et de l’enfant à N’Djamena avec l’appui d’ECHO, a expliqué que dans un
contexte d’augmentation des cas de malnutrition, assurer une réponse humanitaire à l’échelle des
besoins est un impératif. Cependant, le faible financement actuel ne permet pas de répondre à
l’ensemble des besoins urgents. Alima constate une augmentation des admissions dans les centres
nutritionnels, sans disposer des moyens suffisants pour prendre en charge tous les cas en
garantissant des soins de qualité.

Le sous-financement du plan de réponse humanitaire 2017, et en particulier du secteur nutrition, qui
n’a été couvert qu’à 47% des 58 millions de dollars requis, a fortement affecté les activités de prise
en charge des enfants malnutris, de prévention et de collecte de données nutritionnelles, ne
permettant pas d’inverser la tendance.

Le secteur nutrition d’urgence estime qu’en 2018 plus de 1,7 million de personnes auront besoin
d’assistance nutritionnelle d’urgence dans le pays, accroissant les besoins financiers à 62 millions de
dollars pour assister plus de 500 000 personnes les plus vulnérables. Par ailleurs, pour des
interventions à plus long terme, le pays se doit de mettre en œuvre sa Politique Nationale de Nutrition
et d’Alimentation (PNNA 2014-2025) et le Plan d’Action Intersectoriel de Nutrition et d’Alimentation
(PAINA), qui prône une approche holistique et multisectorielle de la prise en charge de la
problématique de la malnutrition dans le pays. En effet, le PAINA, dont le coût de la mise en œuvre
est estimé à 204 344 277 102 Francs CFA sur cinq années, matérialise la volonté de l’Etat de lutter
efficacement contre les différentes formes de la malnutrition, synthétisée dans la Politique Nationale
de Nutrition et d’Alimentation (PNNA), adoptée en avril 2015.

2376729,"Cholera Outbreaks in Central and West Africa: 2017 Regional Update - Week 48 [EN/FR] **Chad:** The outbreak seems to be under control. As per the end of W48, only the Regional Health Delegation of Salamat reported few sporadic cases. Based on the sitreps available (accessible online under “Current Outbreaks/Chad”), as per W49, no new cases were reported.  
**Nigeria:** Only 2 LGAs in North East Nigeria are reported the remaining cases (Guzamala and Monguno).  
The second round of cholera vaccination is currently ongoing but to be noted that it does not unfortunately target these 2 LGAs. For Borno state, several discrepancies were noticed, comparing the daily sitreps from Borno state and the federal consolidated bulletin produced by NCDC, and therefore, motivating the preference to directly collect the info from Borno daily sitreps

**DR of the Congo:** Between W1 and W48, 50,579 suspected cholera cases including 1,083 deaths (Case-fatality ratio of 2.1%) are reported from 23 provinces and 225 health zones. To be noted that while this bulletin was prepared, the completeness rate of the database shared was not of 100%. However, the overall decrease of the reported cholera incidence is clear as the incidence reduces in several provinces (notably North Kivu, South Kivu, Kongo Central, Sankuru, Tanganyika, and Ituri). The national coordination team for cholera control is stating in their last report that, the lack of systematic community-led response continues to great limit and hinder the overall control, and so is the absence of cholera response plan in the 10 main cities that could lead to new outbreaks as well.

**Kasaï – cholera alert:** The epidemic is still expanding to new areas in the Great Kasai, despite an overall reduction in the cumulative incidence. Readers shall find online a report on a new outbreak in Masuika area, 65km away from Luiza and 250km away from Kananga. The national coordination team for cholera control is encouraging partners currently working in Luiza to expand their area of intervention to Masuika and support the response there in order to prevent further expan-sion to Kananga.",268,"French"

2376444,"Les Pays-Bas apportent une contribution d’environ 1.17 millions de dollars au Fonds Fiduciaire en Soutien à la Paix et la Sécurité au Mali Les Pays-Bas renforcent leur participation au Fonds Fiduciaire en Soutien à la Paix et à la Sécurité au Mali, avec une contribution d’environ 1.17 millions de dollars américains. Cet appui s’est concrétisé au cours d’une cérémonie tenue ce 13 décembre au Quartier Général de la MINUSMA.

Le Représentant spécial adjoint du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies aux affaires politiques et Chef par intérim de la MINUSMA, M. Koen Davidse, a officiellement signé avec le Chef de la Coopération des Pays-Bas et Chargé d’Affaires, M. Paul Tholen, une convention de financement d’un montant d’environ 1.17 million de dollars américains au Fonds Fiduciaire, administré par la MINUSMA en soutien à la Paix et la Sécurité au Mali. Dans le cadre de l’appui du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas à la Paix et à la Sécurité au Mali, la nouvelle contribution néerlandaise sera dédiée à la Commission Internationale d’Enquête, un mécanisme clé prévu par l’Accord pour la Paix et la Réconciliation au Mali, issu du processus d’Alger.

M. Davidse a déclaré que « cette contribution des Pays-Bas souligne encore une fois son rôle moteur en faveur de la justice et les droits de l’homme. L’opérationnalisation de la Commission Internationale d’Enquête est une contribution essentielle pour la paix, la justice et la réconciliation au Mali et jouera un rôle complémentaire au travail du Comité de Vérité, Justice et Réconciliation et de la Cour pénale internationale. Le financement total sera assuré par plusieurs bailleurs de fonds, symbolisant une solidarité internationale avec le Mali.»

Il importe de rappeler que les Pays-Bas sont déjà engagés aux côtés de la MINUSMA par sa contribution à la Force militaire et à la Police des Nations Unies. Cette contribution est destinée à protéger les populations maliennes et soutenir la stabilité et la sécurité du Mali.

En outre, à travers le Fond Fiduciaire, depuis 2015, les Pays-Bas accordent un appui crucial au processus de médiation et à la Commission de Suivi de l’Accord et ont facilité la fusion technique d’ASIFU avec U2 (la Force). Le renforcement de la chaine pénale criminelle à Tombouctou, Gao, Ménaka et Mopti a également été soutenu dans une collaboration fructueuse entre la MINUSMA et les Pays-Bas. De plus, les Pays-Bas ont soutenu la réhabilitation d’un barrage de rétention d’eau à Kidal, ainsi que la réalisation d’une étude technique pour définir les travaux nécessaires  à la réhabilitation de la route de l’aéroport de Gao.

Pour rappel, le Fonds Fiduciaire des Nations Unies en Soutien à la Paix et la Sécurité au Mali a été créé à la demande du Conseil de Sécurité (Résolution 2085 (2012)), afin de soutenir les efforts du Gouvernement du Mali à faire face à la crise et garantir les perspectives de développement à long-terme du pays, tels que le retour de l’autorité de l’Etat, la promotion du dialogue national, la réforme du secteur de sécurité, la coopération régionale, les droits de l’homme, le soutien aux élections, le processus de Désarmement-Démobilisation-Réinsertion et réintégration et, des projets socio-économiques.

2376439,"Journée Internationale des droits de l’homme 2017 au Mali. Un maître mot : engagés ! Mardi 12 décembre 2017, a été célébrée, à l’Ecole de Maintien de la Paix (EMP) à Bamako, la Journée internationale des droits de l’homme. Cette cérémonie marque également le lancement de la campagne annuelle pour les 70 ans de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme.

Au Mali, la campagne nationale a été lancée par le Ministre des Droits de l’Homme et de la Réforme de l’Etat, Me Kassoum Tapo, en présence de 500 participants. Parmi eux, de nombreux militants et responsables d’associations et d’organisations de défense des droits de l’homme, les élèves issus de 13 clubs des droits de l’homme des lycées de la capitale, des pensionnaires du centre de prise en charge des enfants à besoins spécifiques ""Housna Ka So"" (la Maison d’Housna), ainsi que leurs encadreurs ou encore, les membres du Forum National pour l’Education aux droits de l’homme. Les représentants du Gouvernement, de la Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme, du Médiateur de la République, ainsi que les Chefs d’Agence des Nations Unies, les chefs de Sections et Divisions de la MINUSMA mais également des représentants du Corps diplomatique et d’EUCAP-Sahel, ont également tenu à y être présents ou représentés et ce, au plus haut niveau pour la plus part d’entre eux. 

Premier à prendre la parole, le Commissaire Mahamane Agaly Maiga de la Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme, a félicité les efforts du Gouvernement pour le renforcement du système national de protection des droits de l’homme, à travers la création d’un département ministériel y dédié et l’établissement d’une nouvelle Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme. Il a aussi félicité les Nations Unies en général et la MINUSMA en particulier, pour l’accompagnement des efforts du Gouvernement malien dans la promotion et la protection des droits de l’homme.

Lui succédant au pupitre, M. Guillaume Ngefa, Directeur de la Division des Droits de l’Homme et de la Protection (DDHP) de la MINUSMA, a lu le message du Haut-Commissaire aux droits de l’homme de l’ONU, dont il est le Représentant au Mali. Dans ce message, un appel est lancé pour que cette année 2018, qui marque les 70 ans de la déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme, soit : « une année de réflexion profonde et intense sur l'importance vitale de chacun des 30 articles contenus dans ce document extraordinaire ». Le message du Haut-Commissaire a également rappelé qu’ : « il est essentiel que nous continuions à tenir les Etats responsables. Mais ces droits sont trop importants pour être laissés aux seuls États, trop précieux pour nous tous et pour nos enfants ».

Conscient du contexte mondial, le Haut-commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme met en garde quant aux importants risques d’aliénation des droits de l’homme. « Si nous ne défendons pas assez les droits de l’homme - si nous nous détournons quand ils sont maltraités – ils disparaitront lentement et mourront, si cela arrive, le coût en vies humaines et la misère seront immenses, et l'humanité entière paiera un lourd tribut ».

Dans son discours, M. Koen Davidse, Représentant spécial adjoint du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies au Mali pour les Affaires politiques, a  , pour sa part, appelé  à la responsabilité partagée en matière de droits de l’homme et à la nécessité de l’engagement de chacun: élèves, décideurs, défenseurs des droits de l’homme, afin de traduire le contenu de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme dont le 1er article stipule que, "" tous les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux en dignité et en droit"".  Il a conclu en soulignant : « Je convie l’ensemble des acteurs à se donner la main afin que le respect des droits de l’Homme de toutes et tous devienne une réalité tangible à travers le monde, et ici au Mali. Le 10 décembre 1948, lors de l’adoption de cette déclaration universelle, le délégué libanais, Charles Malik déclarait  "" Des milliers de mains ont contribué à sa réalisation"". Il faut poursuivre ensemble, l’accomplissement des droits de l’Homme de toutes et  tous. » A cet instant, le public, qui avait déjà réagi favorablement aux propos du Haut-commissaire aux droits de l’homme, relayé par M. Ngefa, se mit à applaudir à tout rompre.

**Les autorités réaffirment leur engagement**

Le Ministre des Droits de l’Homme et de la Réforme de l’Etat (MDHRE), M. Kassoum Tapo, a réaffirmé, l’engagement du Mali pour continuer les efforts en matière de protection et de promotion des droits de l’homme et a exprimé sa fierté et son espoir comblé de constater un auditoire jeune à l’occasion de cette célébration. Selon lui, cela démontre que la relève est assurée. Avant de lancer officiellement la campagne, sous un tonnerre d’applaudissements, le Ministre a rappelé l’importance de l’engagement de chacun pour ses droits et ceux des autres et affirmé, à nouveau, la volonté politique du Gouvernement, de faire des droits de l’homme une priorité. M. Tapo s’est ensuite vu gratifié d’une ""standing ovation"" après qu’il ait annoncé qu’une loi sur la protection des défenseurs des droits de l’homme doit être discutée, ce jour même, à l’Assemblée Nationale du Mali.

Une vidéo, produite par le Bureau de l’Information du Public de la MINUSMA en étroite collaboration avec la DDHP, a ensuite été diffusée. Introduite par M. Ngefa, son Directeur et Représentant du Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme, cette vidéo des voix malienne démontre l’engagement des maliens pour la concrétisation des 30 articles de la Déclaration Universelle des droits de l’homme, afin qu’elle puisse être une réalité pour tous au Mali.

Des jeunes élèves filles et garçons ont exprimé et imagé les réalités des jeunes filles victimes de mariage précoces et forcé, de discrimination et d’autres types d’abus et violations des droits de l’homme. Ils ont dépeint un tableau de ce que vivent réellement de nombreuses filles au Mali. La joie qui envahissait alors la salle, va laisser place à l’émotion. Des larmes et des acclamations ont ponctué les spectacles de percussions, de théâtre, de poésie et de slam des jeunes militants, élèves des clubs droits de l’homme.

**Une série d’activités pour célébrer la journée internationale des droits de l’homme**

La célébration de la journée a été précédée par une série d’activités dont la campagne des 16 jours d’activisme contre les violences faites aux femmes et aux filles, la journée internationale des personnes handicapées, la visite des lieux de privation de liberté à Bamako, et le symposium national sur les droits de l’homme.

Le vendredi 8 décembre, la DDHP de la Mission onusienne au Mali, a participé à une visite conjointe des lieux de privation de liberté avec les organisations de défense des droits de l’homme, la Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme, le Ministère des Droits de l’Homme et de la Réforme de l’Etat. Plusieurs commissariats, brigades de gendarmerie, la Maison Centrale d’Arrêt de Bamako et le Centre psychiatrique du point G, ont été passés en revue. Ces visites ont permis de s’enquérir des conditions de détention à Bamako mais aussi, de sensibiliser les autorités et les agents en charge de la surveillance des détenus.

Le lendemain, le 9 décembre a eu lieu le symposium national sur les droits de l’homme, à l’Hôtel El Farouk de Bamako. Pour sa 6ème édition, ce symposium organisé par le Ministère des droits de l’homme et de la réforme de l’Etat était placé sous le thème de la responsabilité partagée en matière de droits de l’homme dans un contexte de fragilité.

Le symposium a regroupé une soixantaine de participants dont des universitaires, des représentants d’organisations de défense des droits de l’homme, la Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme, le Bureau du Médiateur, les représentants des différents Ministères, ainsi que des Nations Unies, d’EUCAP Sahel, et de MISAHEL.

Dans son allocution, M. Guillaume Ngefa a mis l’accent sur les défis de protection des droits de l’homme dans une situation de fragilité et l’impérieuse nécessité de renforcer la présence de l’Etat pour ne pas laisser des territoires entiers au contrôle des groupes armés et autres bande organisés autour d’activités criminelles, souvent même transnationales. Il a aussi indiqué que l’impunité, le déni des abus et violations des droits de l’homme ainsi que l’inaction, constituaient les caractéristiques de cette fragilité.

La Présidente de la Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme, Me Kadidia Sangaré, a désigné l’impunité, la corruption, l’absence de l’Etat dans certaines localité ainsi que l’insécurité comme étant des facteurs de fragilité auxquels il faut remédier. Le Représentant de la MISAHEL, M. Hugues Penda a quant à lui apprécié le caractère inclusif des activités relatives à la célébration de la journée internationale des droits de l’homme.

Dans son discours, le Ministre des droits de l’homme et de la réforme de l’Etat a évoqué la responsabilité partagée de l’Etat et de la Communauté internationale dans le cadre de la promotion et de la protection des droits de l’homme. Il a ajouté que la célébration de la journée internationale des droits de l’homme nous rappelle que l’essentiel, c’est la dignité humaine. Il réitéré l’engagement du Gouvernement à continuer à promouvoir et protéger les droits de l’homme au Mali. Ceci devrait se traduire lors de l’Examen périodique universel du Mali, le 18 janvier prochain à Genève.

Célébrée à l’issue de la Campagne des ""16 jours d’activisme contre les violences faites aux femmes et aux filles"", la Journée internationale des droits de l’homme vient sanctionner une quinzaine entièrement consacrée à la promotion et à la protection des droits humains. Avec ces célébrations, ces visites de terrains et ces ateliers de réflexion, l’ONU au Mali, rappelle et démontre, une fois de plus, son attachement à la promotion et au respect des droits de l’homme, fondement même de l’organisation. La préservation de ces droits qui par ailleurs est tout aussi importante dans l’accompagnement des maliens sur le chemin de la paix et de la réconciliation.",268,"French"
2376429,"Le relèvement de Bambari sur la bonne voie En visite à Bambari (Ouaka), le 13 décembre 2017, pour évaluer les avancées enregistrées dans la mise en œuvre du Plan opérationnel de stabilisation immédiate de cette ville (POSIB), une délégation de six membres du Gouvernement, en compagnie de partenaires techniques et financiers de la RCA, a pu constater les progrès et les défis restants dans cette ville du Centre du pays naguère en proie aux activités des groupes armes.

Répartis en groupes selon les thématiques ""Sécurité Publique, Justice et Administration Pénitentiaire"" ; ""Administration Civile et Gouvernance Financière"" et ""Infrastructures et Secteurs Productifs"", les membres du gouvernement et les partenaires au développement ont visité de nombreux bâtiments déjà réhabilités, des infrastructures publiques ou communautaires à reconstruire et échangé avec les principaux responsables locaux sur place. 

Pour le chef de la mission, le Ministre de l’Économie, du Plan et de la Coopération, Félix Moloua, cette visite a permis de noter des progrès significatifs dans le relèvement de Bambari. En guise d’illustration, « de nombreux bâtiments étatiques sont disponibles et relativement fonctionnels, les forces de sécurité intérieures déployées dans la ville sont opérationnelles et actives sur le terrain ; ce sont là des signes palpables que l’Etat a entièrement retrouvé son autorité à Bambari », a fait remarquer le Ministre Moloua lors de la réunion de restitution tenue à l’hôtel de ville avec l’ensemble des autorités administratives et leaders communautaires locaux. Le Ministre de l’économie en a profité pour insister sur l’importance du projet de stabilisation de Bambari pour le reste du pays. « Si nous réussissons à faire redémarrer l’économie locale et à relancer plus durablement l’administration ici, cette expérience pilote sera dupliquée dans les autres régions du pays », a-t-il assuré.  

Pour accompagner le POSIB, les partenaires techniques et financiers de la délégation ont réaffirmé leur détermination à poursuivre leurs appuis multiformes. « En plus des nombreux projets déjà financés, la Banque mondiale appuiera la remise en état des infrastructures de la SODECA et de l’ENERCA afin de rétablir l’électricité et l’eau dans la ville », a promis Robert Jaoude, Représentant résident Banque mondiale en RCA. 

Pour autant, la délégation a identifié certains dysfonctionnements dans le processus de relance de Bambari ; notamment la désertion de certains fonctionnaires, l’absence de services publics vitaux tels que le Trésor Public, les Impôts et la faible qualité des travaux de réhabilitation de certains bâtiments. La mission a, à cet effet, formulé des recommandations dont un plaidoyer à initier auprès du gouvernement pour un redéploiement durable des services financiers et plus de rigueur dans le contrôle des effectifs des agents de l’Etat et le suivi des travaux de réhabilitation.

Cette importante visite gouvernementale a été également l’occasion pour inaugurer les locaux du Commissariat de police de Bambari et remettre des équipements informatiques et de bureaux à la Police, la Gendarmerie et à la Préfecture. Lors de la remise officielle des bâtiments de la police et de la gendarmerie, le Ministre de l’Intérieur Chargé de la Sécurité Publique, Henry Wanzet Linguissara, a tenu à rassurer la population sur les récentes rumeurs de déstabilisation de Bambari. « Je vous encourage à vaquer paisiblement à vos occupations quotidiennes. Avec la présence des forces de sécurité intérieures et de la MINUSCA, Bambari est une ville sûre et tout sera mis en œuvre pour maintenir cette sécurité retrouvée » a-t-il déclaré pour rassurer la popualtion.

Le Plan Opérationnel de Stabilisation Immédiate de Bambari est une initiative gouvernementale lancée suite à l’opération ""Bambari ville sans groupes armés"" qui a permis de déloger les groupes armés de la ville, contribuant ainsi à restaurer l’autorité de l’Etat et à renforcer la protection des civils dans la ville.

2376424,"La Norvège apporte une contribution d’environ 960 000 dollars américains au Fonds Fiduciaire en Soutien à la Paix et la Sécurité au Mali La Norvège renforce sa participation au Fonds Fiduciaire en Soutien à la Paix et la Sécurité au Mali avec une contribution d’environ 960 000 dollars américains. Cet appui s’est concrétisé au cours d’une cérémonie tenue ce 14 décembre au Quartier Général de la MINUSMA.

Le Représentant spécial adjoint du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies chargé des affaires politiques, M. Koen Davidse, a officiellement signé avec l’Ambassadeur de Norvège au Mali, M. Ole Andreas Lindeman, une convention de financement d’un montant d’environ 960 000 dollars américains au Fonds Fiduciaire, administré par la MINUSMA, en soutien à la paix et la sécurité au Mali.

Dans le cadre de l’appui du gouvernement norvégien à la Paix et à la Sécurité au Mali, cette nouvelle contribution viendra soutenir la mise en œuvre de l’Accord de paix (avec une attention particulière pour l’inclusion des femmes), la restauration de l’autorité de l’Etat et la réalisation tangibles des dividendes de la paix pour les populations du nord et du centre du Mali.

M. Davidse a déclaré que « cette nouvelle contribution de la Norvège au Fonds Fiduciaire atteste de son engagement indéfectible en faveur du processus de paix en cours. Par ailleurs, sa contribution est d’autant plus essentielle qu’elle cible les femmes et les populations qui constituent de puissants vecteurs de paix et de changements ». 

La précédente contribution de la Norvège au Fonds Fiduciaire d’un montant d’environ 1.6 million de dollars a notamment permis d’appuyer les autorités intérimaires, grâce à un projet de renforcement de leurs capacités et de sensibilisation des populations à leur fonction. Des projets ont également été développés en soutien à des mécanismes clés de l’accord de paix tels que le Comité Technique de Sécurité, les Equipes Mixtes d’Observation et de Vérification et le Mécanisme Opérationnel de Coordination.

Pour rappel, le Fonds Fiduciaire des Nations Unies en Soutien à la Paix et la Sécurité au Mali a été créé à la demande du Conseil de Sécurité (Résolution 2085 (2012)), pour soutenir les efforts du Gouvernement du Mali à faire face à la crise et à garantir les perspectives de développement à long-terme du pays, telles que le retour de l’autorité de l’Etat, l’ordre constitutionnel, la promotion du dialogue national, la réforme du secteur de la sécurité, la coopération régionale, les droits de l’homme, le soutien aux élections, le processus de Désarmement-Démobilisation-Réinsertion et Réintégration et des projets socio-économiques.

2376419,"Le pacte mondial, une occasion de s’engager sur une autre voie **Selon Filippo Grandi, le HCR ne doit jamais dire « c’est impossible » pour aborder et surmonter les défis d’aujourd’hui en termes de déplacements de populations.**

Par Jonathan Clayton 

GENÈVE – Un an après que le monde se soit engagé à collaborer pour améliorer sa réponse aux crises de réfugiés, la tragédie du déplacement forcé s’est aggravée, a déclaré aujourd’hui le chef du HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés.

Lors de l'ouverture d'une importante conférence sur le nouveau Pacte mondial pour les réfugiés qui se tenait à Genève, Filippo Grandi a souligné qu'à travers le monde, des gens continuent de devoir fuir leurs foyers, victimes de l'échec collectif de la communauté internationale à prévenir et résoudre les conflits.

« Notre mission est plus urgente que jamais… L’exode du Myanmar vers le Bangladesh est le plus visible, mais des civils innocents continuent de fuir pour avoir la vie sauve en République centrafricaine, en RDC, en Irak, au Soudan du Sud, en Syrie et ailleurs », a déclaré le Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés.

Filippo Grandi présentait l’allocution d’ouverture du 10e Dialogue du Haut Commissaire sur les défis de protection qui se tient ces 12 et 13 décembre.

L'objectif de la conférence est essentiellement de procéder à un état des lieux sur les consultations tenues depuis que 193 états membres et les Nations Unies ont adopté, en 2016, la Déclaration de New York par laquelle les membres s'engagent à mieux partager la responsabilité des réfugiés dans le monde et à soutenir les communautés qui les accueillent dans le cadre d'un pacte mondial. Ce travail comprenait la rédaction d'un Cadre d’action global pour les réfugiés.

« L’attention que le monde porte aux réfugiés peut croitre et décroître en fonction des aléas de la politique internationale, mais la Déclaration de New York reste un engagement politique de haut niveau en faveur d’une nouvelle réponse aux crises de réfugiés », a-t-il déclaré devant les délégués au Palais des Nations de Genève.

« Le pacte mondial devrait être l’instrument permettant de matérialiser cet engagement par des mesures concrètes, pour que les réfugiés aient un minimum de chances de reconstruire des vies productives et utiles, d’apporter leur contribution aux communautés qui les accueillent et de façonner ainsi leur propre avenir », a-t-il ajouté.

Dans son appel pour que ce pacte transforme l’approche de la communauté internationale sur les questions de réfugiés, Filippo Grandi a maintenu que l’échec de la coopération internationale a également affaibli la protection de ceux qui fuient les conflits et la persécution et qui rencontrent des frontières fermées, des restrictions d’accès et l’exploitation politique des mouvements de réfugiés.

« Les réfugiés (en) paient le prix, au même titre que la poignée de pays qui assument la plus grosse part de la charge de l’accueil de réfugiés sans pouvoir compter sur le soutien des autres qui disposent de moyens plus importants », a-t-il expliqué en ajoutant : « À une époque où le multilatéralisme est en perte de vitesse dans d’autres sphères, le pacte mondial pour les réfugiés est pour nous l’occasion de nous engager sur une autre voie grâce à un engagement et une coopération pratique reposant sur des valeurs humanitaires. »

Filippo Grandi a qualifié la Déclaration de New York de jalon qui offre une plus grande visibilité politique aux crises de réfugiés, suscite l’engagement et réaffirme fermement les valeurs humanitaires fondamentales.

Il a félicité les 13 pays qui ont déjà lancé la mise en place du Cadre global pour les réfugiés ainsi que ceux qui ont participé à l’examen des enseignements clés tirés jusqu’à présent et des observations découlant des autres crises de réfugiés de grande échelle. Il s’est également félicité des engagements pris au cours des récentes conférences.

Il a qualifié de ‘positives, orientées vers l'avenir et riches en idées’ les discussions thématiques, organisées de juillet à novembre 2017.

Quelque 500 représentants de gouvernements, d’autorités locales, de la société civile, du secteur privé, du monde universitaire, d’organisations et d’institutions financières internationales, et de jeunes délégués des réfugiés du monde entier sont attendus pour la conférence.

L’Ouganda a été le premier pays à appliquer le Cadre d’action global pour les réfugiés après l’adoption de la Déclaration de New York. En s’adressant à l’assemblée à Genève, l’adjoint du représentant permanent, Benedict Lawrence Lukwiya, a souligné à quel point la politique pour les réfugiés menée par son pays « a subi la pression de l’afflux constant » de plus d’un million de réfugiés.

« C’est parce que le gouvernement a réalisé très tôt qu’il était nécessaire d’aller au-delà de la protection des réfugiés et de l’intervention d’urgence, pour répondre aux besoins de développement à plus long terme. Deuxièmement, le gouvernement a également réalisé que l’intervention humanitaire doit être soutenue si nous voulons assurer une prestation efficace et obtenir des résultats tangibles dans les étapes ultérieures de l’accueil des réfugiés. »

« Le modèle de coordination des réfugiés de l’Ouganda et son plan d’intervention en faveur des réfugiés ont été centrés sur des solutions dès le tout début de l’afflux de réfugiés, ainsi que sur des interventions vitales et la protection de l’environnement. La réussite enregistrée dans ces domaines découle de la politique d’intégration de l’aide offerte aux communautés d’accueil et de l’inclusion des réfugiés dans la planification du gouvernement. »

Benedict Lawrence Lukwiya a conclu son intervention par un appel à tous les bailleurs de fonds et à toutes les parties prenantes à honorer leurs engagements pour « réaliser les objectifs de partage du fardeau que nous nous sommes fixés dans la Déclaration de New York. Et cela devrait également comprendre des offres de réinstallation dans des pays tiers pour les réfugiés en Ouganda. »

Le pacte mondial pour les réfugiés reposera sur le cadre international existant pour la protection des réfugiés, notamment sur la Convention pour les réfugiés de 1951, et son objectif est de répartir d’une manière plus équitable la responsabilité de l’accueil des réfugiés dans le monde et de les aider à reconstruire leurs vies.

Il dressera un ensemble de mesures concrètes que devront prendre les gouvernements et d’autres parties prenantes pour veiller à ce que les communautés d’accueil des réfugiés obtiennent l’aide dont elles ont besoin dans les meilleurs délais et que les réfugiés soient mieux inclus dans les communautés qui les accueillent (avec un accès à la santé, l’éducation et aux moyens de subsistance), et que des solutions au sort des réfugiés soient recherchées dès le tout début d’une crise de réfugiés.
Le HCR entamera des consultations formelles sur le pacte avec les gouvernements et d’autres parties prenantes dès février 2018. Le Haut-Commissaire proposera un pacte à l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies vers la fin 2018.",268,"French"

Le Projet Eau et Assainissement de l’Agence Américaine pour le Développement International (USAID), soutient l’objectif que les États-Unis partagent avec le gouvernement haïtien pour étendre l’accès à l’eau potable et l’assainissement aux communautés vulnérables, le front de lutte le plus important contre le choléra et d’autres maladies hydriques.

Le projet Eau et Assainissement de l’USAID représente un investissement de 41,8 millions de dollars et s’alignera sur les priorités du Ministère de la Santé Publique d’Haïti et de la Direction Nationale de l’Eau Potable et de l’Assainissement (DINEPA). Il vise à améliorer la santé des Haïtiens en s’appuyant sur les investissements effectués antérieurement par les Etats-Unis en Haïti et adoptera une approche plus globale de l’eau, de l’assainissement et de l’hygiène qui renforcera les institutions nationales et locales travaillant dans ce secteur.

Le projet Eau et Assainissement de l’USAID fait partie de la Stratégie Mondiale de l’Eau des Etats-Unis pour assurer la sécurité en eau dans le monde entier. Il vise à promouvoir à travers la planète un accès durable à des services d’eau potable et d’assainissement, l’adoption de comportements d’hygiène clés et le renforcement de la gouvernance, du financement et des institutions du secteur de l’eau.

Cette loi qui renforce et raffine les efforts de mise en œuvre du sénateur Paul Simon de la loi « Eau pour les pauvres » de 2005, garantit que les programmes d’eau, d’assainissement et d’hygiène ciblent les plus pauvres du monde, et contribuent à des résultats durables à long terme.

Le projet se concentrera sur l’expansion de l’accès à des services améliorés d’eau et d’assainissement dans les communes prioritaires du choléra identifiées dans le « Plan national à moyen terme pour l’élimination du choléra » et dans les communes se remettant de catastrophes naturelles telles que l’ouragan Matthew. Il impliquera également le secteur privé dans la création de solutions pour élargir l’accès aux services d’eau et d’assainissement.

**La situation nutritionnelle s’aggrave au Tchad**

**Plus de la moitié des régions en urgence nutritionnelle**

Selon les résultats de l’enquête nutritionnelle (SMART) de septembre 2017, organisée par le ministère de la Santé publique avec l’appui de ses partenaires, les prévalences de la malnutrition aigüe se sont dégradées au plan national, avec 3,9% de prévalence (audessus du seuil d’urgence de 2%) pour la malnutrition aigüe sévère (MAS) et 13,9% (proche du seuil d’urgence de 15%) pour la malnutrition aigüe globale (MAG). En 2016, les prévalences de la MAG et de la MAS au plan national étaient respectivement de 11,9% et 2,6 %.

La situation nutritionnelle s’est donc fortement détériorée en 2017.  
Sur le plan régional, 12 régions sur 23 sont au-dessus du seuil d’urgence de MAG et 15 régions ont enregistré des taux de MAS au-dessus du seuil d’urgence de 2%. Les régions les plus touchées par la MAG sont les deux Ennedis (Est et Ouest), le Salamat, le Batha et le Barh-El-Gazal.

1.Sur le plan de la pluviométrie, les cumuls saisonniers ont été globalement normaux à excédentaires. Toutefois, la mauvaise répartition et l’arrêt précoce des pluies ont affecté par endroits les cultures et la production de biomasse au Tchad, Niger, au Burkina Faso, au Sénégal, en Mauritanie et en Gambie. Cette situation est plus dramatique au Cap Vert où les pluies ont été rares.

2.Sur le plan hydrologique, les écoulements ont été déficitaires sur les hauts bassins des fleuves Sénégal et Niger, mais excédentaires sur les autres bassins, en particulier le bassin du Lac Tchad. Cette situation aurait entre autres impacts : un faible niveau d’extension des cultures de décrue dans la basse vallée du Sénégal, une extension limitée de la crue du Delta-Intérieur du Mali créant des conditions peu favorables pour les cultures irriguées et les productions halieutiques dans cette partie stratégique du bassin du Niger, des étiages sévères dans la partie moyenne du bassin, en particulier, en territoire nigérien. Par contre, le niveau de crue exceptionnel enregistré sur le bassin du Lac Tchad serait très favorable au développement des cultures de décrue dans les importantes zones inondables du bassin Chari-Logone.

3.La situation phytosanitaire a été marquée par les attaques de la chenille légionnaire sur le maïs qui ont été signalées dans plusieurs pays. Mais, grâce à l’intensité et a régularité des pluies enregistrées au cours des mois de juillet et août en plus des interventions réalisées, les effets de ces attaques ont été limités. Toutefois, l’apparition de ce ravageur dans la région constitue une menace permanente pour les cultures en raison de sa grande capacité d’adaptation. 

4.Sur le plan agricole, le niveau de satisfaction des besoins en eau des cultures, a été globalement bon durant la saison sauf dans certaines zones des pays du Sahel où les cultures ont souffert des stress hydriques liés aux séquences sèches et à l’arrêt précoce des pluies. Ainsi, les productions céréalières attendues sont estimées à 68,3 millions de tonnes, soit une hausse de 4% par rapport à la campagne 2016-2017 et de 13% comparée à la moyenne des cinq dernières années.  
Toutefois, des baisses significatives comparées à l’année passée et à la moyenne quinquennale, pourraient être enregistrées en Mauritanie (-5 et -12%), en Guinée Bissau (-7 et -5%), en Gambie (-27 et -38%) et particulièrement au Cap Vert où les productions ont été insignifiantes du fait de l’absence des pluies. Pour les tubercules avec 182,4 millions de tonnes, les productions seraient en hausse de 15% et 18% respectivement par rapport à l’année dernière et à la moyenne quinquennale. Il en est de même pour les productions des légumineuses avec 8,3 millions de tonnes pour l’arachide, 7,7 millions pour le niébé et 1,7 millions pour le soja, exception faite de la production du Voandzou qui, avec 145 milles tonnes, est en baisse.

5.La situation pastorale est très préoccupante dans la zone sahélienne en raison des mauvaises conditions d’installation et de développement de la végétation notamment les pauses pluviométriques enregistrées et l’arrêt précoce des pluies. Par conséquent, les productions fourragères restent très faibles et quasi inexistantes dans les grandes zones d’élevage en Mauritanie, au Nord Sénégal, au Cap Vert au Sahel Burkinabé, au Nord et à l’Est du Niger, à l’Ouest et à l’Est du Sahel tchadien et par endroits au Mali. Cette situation a déjà occasionné des départs massifs et précocesdes éleveurs vers les zones d’accueil du Sénégal et du Mali où des conflits pourraient sévir. Cela laisse présager en perspective, une soudure très précoce et des conditions très difficiles d’alimentation du bétail dans ces zones.

6.Les marchés agricoles dans la région sont globalement bien approvisionnés à la faveur des récoltes en cours et flux transfrontaliers. Toutefois, la baisse des prix habituellement observée en période de récolte a été plus faible. Par conséquent, les prix des denrées sont restés en hausse par rapport à la moyenne des cinq dernières années dans la quasi-totalité des pays sauf au Tchad et au Cap Vert aussi bien pour les céréales que pour les tubercules. Cette hausse des prix serait due, en grande partie, aux effets des perturbations enregistrées au niveau des certaines devises et aux effets des inflations au Nigéria, au Ghana, en Sierra Léone et au Libéria. Ce contexte de hausse de prix pourrait s’atténuer avec les cours internationaux et les stocks mondiaux qui restent favorables même si des légères tendances à la hausse sont observées ces derniers mois sur l’indice des prix des céréales. Les prix des produits de rente connaissent globalement une stabilité en comparaison avec la moyenne quinquennale à l’image de l’arachide et du niébé.

7.Sur les marchés à bétail, les prix des bovins et des petits ruminants sont stables avec une tendance à la baisse par rapport à la moyenne quinquennale du fait des conditions pastorales difficiles et la faiblesse de la demande globale du bétail liée à l’insécurité civile qui limite les échanges commerciaux particulièrement au Tchad. Par conséquent, les termes de l’échange bétail/céréales sont en nette détérioration dans la région. Si rien n’est fait cela pourrait entrainer une dégradation des moyens d’existence des ménages pauvres et très pauvres notamment au niveau des éleveurs pasteurs.

8.En dépit des efforts déployés par les Etats et leurs partenaires, la situation nutritionnelle demeure préoccupante dans certaines régions de la Mauritanie, du Mali, du Tchad et du Nord-Est Nigeria où la prévalence de la malnutrition aigüe globale (MAG) dépasse le seuil d’urgence de 15%. Toutefois les prévalences de malnutrition aiguë sévère ont connu une hausse dans les pays sus mentionnés. Ainsi, de Janvier à septembre 2017, plus de 1,2 millions d’enfants malnutris aigus sévères ont été dépistés et pris en charge.

9.Les analyses du Cadre Harmonisé conduites dans les 17 pays du CILSS, de la CEDEAO et de l’UEMOA, ont révélé la persistance de l’insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle particulièrement dans les régions du Lac au Tchad, de Diffa au Niger et dans les Etats de Borno, Adamawa et Yobé au Nigéria en raison de l’insécurité civile qui a occasionné plus de 2,8 millions de personnes déplacées et réfugiées. Ainsi, entre octobre et décembre 2017, plus de 5,2 millions de personnes auront besoin d’une assistance alimentaire et humanitaire immédiate pour sauver des vies humaines et lutter contre la malnutrition. Si les réponses prévues ne sont pas mises en œuvre, y compris des mesures pour faire face aux conditions difficiles d’alimentation du bétail dans la zone pastorale du Sahel, d’ici la période de soudure prochaine couvrant les mois de juin à août 2018, et en plus de la détérioration des conditions d’alimentation du bétail déjà précaire dans la zone pastorale du Sahel, le nombre de personnes en crise à pire pourrait atteindre 9,6 millions de personnes. Plus de 1 million parmi elles seraient en urgence réparties principalement au Nigeria au Tchad, en Mauritanie, au Burkina Faso, au Niger et au Mali, et plus de 12 milles personnes en famine au Nigéria dans l’Etat d’Adamawa.",268,"French"
2375699,"Joint Statement on Kavumu From PHR, TRIAL International, and Panzi Hospital [EN/FR] **PHR, TRIAL International, Panzi Hospital welcome significant step toward justice and accountability in Kavumu**

**UPDATE: The trial began November 9. **

In the village of Kavumu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), families once endured the unspeakable: children abducted in the night and raped. Nearly five years after the first attacks and after an international mobilization of supporters, a trial to prosecute the alleged offenders will begin on Monday, November 6. Eighteen suspects will face charges, including a local politician. The trial will be a turning point for the fight against impunity in DRC, and civil society both locally and internationally played a decisive role in bringing about this historic moment.

On Monday, November 6, international observers will pay close attention to the village of Kavumu in Congo’s eastern province of South Kivu. It will be the epicenter of one of the most anticipated trials of the year. The defendants are alleged members of an armed militia who, for years, abducted and raped children in this village.

In just a few short years, Kavumu has been a symbol both of the large-scale crimes of sexual violence that have devastated the country, and a demonstration of the impunity with which those crimes are accompanied. The trial itself is one of the few of its kind and could set a crucial precedent.

“The importance of Kavumu extends far beyond the impact on survivors and their families,” said the NGO TRIAL International. “This trial punctures the code of silence and undermines the judicial inertia that often surrounds sexual violence cases in South Kivu. That authorities are now fully reckoning with this issue head-on is a huge step forward for Congolese justice.”

**Babies among the victims**

Some of the agony of these cases is due to the age of the 46 victims – some as young as just a year old when they were raped. The attacks also fit a similar pattern that was repeated over the course of many years.

“The perpetrators broke into our houses at night to kidnap our daughters,” said a mother of a victim who asked for anonymity to protect her from reprisals. “They raped them out of pure superstition, and many suffered injuries that will linger with them the rest of their lives.”

Urged on by a concerned international community and courageous civil society members, the Kavumu military prosecutor took over the case in 2016. During the investigation, 18 suspects were charged with crimes against humanity, since their alleged crimes were both numerous and systematic.

**NGOs on the front line**

The trial in Kavumu will take place thanks to the mobilization of both Congolese and international civil society groups. Together, they combined their expertise to draw the attention of national authorities and help to build a solid case against the alleged offenders.

“We are hopeful that our combined efforts will allow survivors and their families to finally obtain justice and live in peace after so much pain,” said the NGO Physicians for Human Rights, which has supported investigative efforts in Kavumu since the first rape cases were reported. “We are hopeful this process will hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes. And we hope that the collaboration between the medical and legal communities, as well as international and national NGOs, can sustain an effective response system that can prevent future instances of sexual violence.”

An additional difficulty was the vulnerability of the survivors, all of whom were children at the time of the attacks.

“These children relive the aggression perpetrated against them every time they tell their story. The trial’s proceedings are demanding and require deep psychological support,” said Panzi Hospital, which specializes in the treatment of survivors of sexual violence.

On the legal front, the challenge will be proving the systematic nature of the attacks. In order to make a case of crimes against humanity, prosecutors must show that the crimes were part of an organized endeavor, a high bar in a country as unstable as DRC.

“We have been waiting years for this trial to begin, as have the families of all the survivors,” said the NGO community working on these cases. “We now hope that the trial will be conducted in good faith and that the Congolese justice system will justly punish the offenders proportional to the gravity of their crimes.”

- Nécessité urgente d’interventions WASH dans les sites des déplacés en Territoire de Masisi

- 1 310 déplacés et famille d’accueil assistés en articles ménagers à Lubero 

**Aperçu de la situation** 

Malgré que la Province du Nord-Kivu ait été caractérisée par les conflits et les violences, un calme relatif a été observé les dernières semaines dans la zone de Kipese, dans le sud-est de Lubero. Un retour timide des résidents de la zone a été observé dans le courant de la semaine, près de cinq mois après que des affrontements entre les FARDC et les groupes armés avaient poussé ces personnes à la fuite. On estime qu’environ 5 000 personnes, soit le 40% de la population recensée de la ville, sont retournées à Kipese. Cet épiphénomène contraste avec le quotidien des milliers de résidents de la province qui sont poussés au déplacement. Près de 300 nouveaux déplacés dans les villages de Kasindi et Lubiriha (sud-est de Beni), plus de 700 personnes à Mutongo (Walikale) et plus de 700 autre dans les villages de Kalonge et Kalembe (Masisi) ne sont que quelques exemples d’une situation difficile pour des milliers de personnes.  

Le Nord-Kivu a aussi été marqué par la recrudescence des cas suspects de choléra, surtout dans la zone de sante de Mweso (381 cas dont 15 décès), dans le Territoire de Masisi. Dans plusieurs sites des déplacés du Masisi, la nécessité d’interventions en eau, hygiène et assainissement est urgente. Selon le rapport fait par le comité de gestion et coordination de ces sites, au moins un tiers des latrines, sont inutilisables. L'arrivée de nouveaux ménages dans ces sites ne fait qu'augmenter les besoins dans ce secteur.

**Un aperçu des besoins humanitaires**

La crise humanitaire en Centrafrique est l’une des plus aigües au monde. L’Aperçu des besoins humanitaires 2018, développé ce dernier trimestre et basé sur l’analyse des vulnérabilités, observe que 2,5 millions de Centrafricains ont besoin d’une assistance humanitaire. Ce total est en augmentation comparé à fin 2016 où la population dans le besoin était estimée à 2,2 millions de personnes. Parmi les populations affectées fin 2017, 589 090 personnes en situation d’urgence ont des besoins humanitaires critiques. 

Plus d’1,79 million de personnes ont des besoins aigus liés à des vulnérabilités chroniques et 135 428 personnes ont des besoins humanitaires d’appui au retour, la réintégration et la réinstallation. La République centrafricaine continue donc de traverser une crise complexe pour laquelle l’action humanitaire doit, plus que jamais, être mise en oeuvre dans le respect des principes fondamentaux qui la guident et de la centralité de la protection. 

**Résurgence de la violence à Bria** 

A Bria, chef-lieu de la préfecture de la Haute Kotto, les tensions menacent à nouveau la ville depuis le début du mois de novembre 2017 avec la reprise des affrontements entre les groupes armés le long des axes Bria-Ouadda (nord) et Bria-Ippy (sud). Une mission humanitaire indique que, les villages et hameaux sont désertés jusqu’à 29 km de Bria sur la route de Ouadda. La majorité a été pillée et brulée au cours des affrontements. La population civile s’est réfugiée à Bria, dans les rares villages épargnés les plus proches ou encore en brousse. Dans quelques autres localités, la seule présence humaine se résume à celle de groupes armés. Dans cette zone, deux centres de santé et les écoles ont été fermés faute de personnel et de médicaments.  

Les populations, dont les femmes et les enfants, qui ont eu la vie sauve manquent de tout. Leur situation est extrêmement préoccupante car la violence empêche un accès vers cette population en détresse sur les axes.  

Il y a sept mois, en mai 2017, un cycle de violence avait entraîné plus de 41 000 déplacés à Bria, soit la grande majorité des habitants de la ville.
Le principal site de déplacés, celui de PK3, a vu sa population augmenter de manière fulgurante. De 26 747 déplacés internes à la fin du mois de septembre, ils sont désormais 35 000 aujourd’hui, soit une augmentation de près de 20%. La présence visible d’éléments d’un groupe armé qui auraient érigé une base au sein du site constitue un frein de taille à la provision d’aide humanitaire et un obstacle majeur à la protection des civils. Cette violation du caractère neutre et civil du site est constamment dénoncée par la communauté humanitaire et l’engagement avec l’ensemble des parties concernées se poursuit à ce sujet.  

Dans un contexte où la situation sécuritaire continue de se détériorer, les acteurs humanitaires déplorent les intrusions devenues récurrentes de membres de groupes armés dans l’enceinte de l’hôpital de Bria. Ces éléments interdisent l’accès à l’hôpital à leurs adversaires blessés en proférant des menaces à leur encontre ainsi qu’au personnel soignant.  

**Violations du Droit international humanitaire** 

Selon le Droit international, « les hôpitaux civils organisés pour donner des soins aux blessés, aux malades, aux infirmes et aux femmes en couches ne pourront, en aucune circonstance, être l’objet d’attaques ; ils seront, en tout temps, respectés et protégés par les Parties au conflit ».  
L'article 3 commun aux quatre Conventions de Genève est applicable aux conflits armés non internationaux et stipule que « Les personnes qui ne participent pas directement aux hostilités, y compris les membres de forces armées qui ont déposé les armes et les personnes qui ont été mises hors de combat par maladie, blessure, détention, ou pour toute autre cause, seront, en toutes circonstances, traitées avec humanité, sans aucune distinction de caractère défavorable basée sur la race, la couleur, la religion ou la croyance, le sexe, la naissance ou la fortune, ou tout autre critère analogue ». Par conséquent, les groupes armés doivent se conformer à leurs obligations internationales, à savoir traiter et soigner « avec humanité par la Partie au conflit qui les aura en son pouvoir, sans aucune distinction de caractère défavorable basée sur le sexe, la race, la nationalité, la religion, les opinions politiques ou tout autre critère analogue ». Par ailleurs, « Les blessés et les malades seront recueillis et soignés ».",268,"French"

Un don d’une valeur de 1.040.679 de dollars.

Ces réfrigérateurs solaires, seront utilisés au Tchad dans le cadre de la réponse régionale dans le bassin du Lac Tchad à l’épidémie de poliomyélite du Nigeria, à savoir à Bol, Bagasola, Ngouri, Liwa, Isseirom, Kouloudia, Mani, Massaguet, Massakory, Karal et Rig Rig, couvrant ainsi les 11 districts sanitaires prioritaires de la Région du Lac, et permettant de répondre à l’ensemble des besoins d’équipement en chaine de froid, qui se situait jusqu’à présent à 26%.

En dépit des efforts et progrès réalisé au Tchad, seuls 22% des enfants sont vaccinés lors de leur première année constituant un véritable problème de santé publique qui s’explique en partie par le manque d’équipement et les difficultés d’accès.

Bénéficiant des plus récentes avancées technologiques, ces réfrigérateurs sont dotés d’un dispositif de contrôle continu de la température dont la consultation peut se faire à plusieurs kilomètres de distance, à partir d’un téléphone. Cette amélioration significative garantira des conditions optimales de conservation des vaccins administrés aux femmes et aux enfants de la Région du Lac.

L’installation de ces 133 réfrigérateurs dans 130 centres de santé et 3 dépôts de districts sera réalisée par 25 techniciens, qui seront formés à N’Djamena à partir du 18 décembre 2017 par une équipe constituée du fabricant B-Medical System et de LOGIVAC, une école spécialisée en logistique pour la santé basée au Bénin. Les 25 techniciens formeront à leur tour tous les responsables PEV des 11 districts prioritaires et des délégations sanitaires régionales du Lac, d’Hadjer Lamis et du Kanem.

2374704,"Le nouveau mandat de la MINUSCA au menu d’une rencontre entre le Représentant spécial et les journalistes centrafricains À la faveur de  la résolution 2387 adoptée en novembre 2017 par le Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU, le mandat de la MINUSCA à été reformulé conformément aux nouveaux défis sur le terrain. Les tâches prioritaires assignées à la Mission comptent désormais a)la protection des civils; b)les bons offices et appui au processus de paix, y compris à la réconciliation nationale, à la cohésion sociale et à la justice transitionnelle; c)aide la mise en place de conditions de sûreté favorable à l’acheminement immédiat, complet, en toute sécurité et sans entrave de l’aide humanitaire et d) la protection du personnel et des biens des Nations Unies.

Afin d’en permettre la meilleure compréhension et appropriation par les professionnels des médias centrafricains et ainsi les aider à mieux jouer leur rôle d’interface entre la Mission et la population, le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général et chef de la MINUSCA, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, était aujourd’hui, 13 décembre 2017, face aux responsables des medias centrafricains, et s’est prêté au jeu de questions-réponses. C’était au quartier général de la Mission.

Dans ses propos liminaires, le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général a inscrit l’importance de cette rencontre dans le rôle central que la presse a pour vocation de jouer pour la vulgarisation de ce nouveau mandat.  « **Cet exercice est d’une grande importance car vous êtes les acteurs centraux pour que la population puisse comprendre ce que nous sommes et ce que nous faisons dans le pays », a-t-il à leur égard**.

Il s’est aussi agi, lors de cette rencontre qui, désormais s’inscrit dans la régularité, de lever le voile sur certaines questions qui, si elles ne sont pas bien comprises, peuvent être utilisées à des fins de manipulations de l’opinion publique par certains politiciens, ennemis de la paix, et ainsi engendrer des « incompréhensions fâcheuses entre la population et la MINUSCA ».  

Des questions récurrentes telles l’utilisation de la force contre les groupes armés et le déploiement des Forces armées centrafricaines sur le terrain, ont fait l’objet d’échanges, mais aussi le plan national de relèvement dont la première année a été passée en revue, le mardi 12 décembre, en présence du Chef de l’État et de nombreux membres du gouvernement et des partenaires internationaux.

Occasion pour le chef de la MINUSCA de réitérer l’entière disponibilité de la Mission à relever les défis qui sont les siens, dans les limites de ses capacités, y compris jusqu’au sacrifice suprême de ses hommes et femmes lesquels sont régulièrement soumis à l’hostilité des groupes armés dont ils objets d’attaques.

Le chef de la MINUSCA a aussi exhorté les journalistes à appuyer les efforts du gouvernement pour le retour de la paix. « **Ne doutez pas, dans les demandes de résultat de la population, tout est en train d’être mis en place pour des réponses appropriées** », a-t-il dit, rappelant :”nous sommes en train de reconstruire une nation”.

Un message bien favorablement accueilli par des journalistes tels  Albert Mbaya, directeur de publication du quotidien l’Agora, qui fait valoir que  « la presse centrafricaine est prête à relever les défis qui se présentent quant à la vulgarisation du mandat et à être le relais auprès de la population mais elle a surtout besoin d’un soutien constant de la part de la MINUSCA mais aussi du gouvernement centrafricain ».

Même satisfecit chez le responsable du journal en ligne « Réveil Centrafrique », Michael Nguinda, qui souhaite vivement que ce genre d’activité puisse se perpétuer afin de permettre aux hommes et femmes des medias du pays d’être « **effectivement les relais entre la population et la MINUSCA** ».

Cette rencontre répond, à bien des égards, aux prescrits de la nouvelle résolution qui « **prie la MINUSCA à utiliser des outils de communication pertinents et adaptés, en particulier la radio, pour aider la population locale à mieux comprendre son mandat, ses activités et instaurer des relations de confiance avec les citoyens de la République centrafricaine, les parties au conflit, les acteurs régionaux et d’autres acteurs internationaux et les partenaires sur le terrain, dans le cadre d’une politique efficace** ».",268,"French"
2374674,"Personnes déplacées à l'intérieur de leur propre pays et droit international humanitaire - Fiche technique Le droit international humanitaire (DIH) est un ensemble de règles qui, en temps de conflit armé, cherchent – pour des raisons humanitaires – à protéger les personnes qui ne participent pas ou ne participent plus directement aux hostilités, et à restreindre le choix des moyens et méthodes de guerre. Il établit donc des normes minimales d'humanité qui doivent être respectées dans toute situation de conflit armé. Ces normes visent notamment à protéger les populations civiles et leurs moyens de survie. Les violations du DIH – attaques dirigées directement contre des civils et toute forme de mauvais traitement infligé à des civils, destruction de biens ne répondant pas à une nécessité militaire impérative, viol ou autres formes de violence sexuelle, et restrictions illicites à l'accès aux soins de santé et à d'autres services essentiels – constituent l'une des causes principales de déplacement dans les conflits armés d'aujourd'hui. Les civils déplacés doivent souvent lutter pour satisfaire des besoins essentiels dans un contexte de difficultés exacerbées et peuvent se trouver exposés à des risques particuliers, tels que tensions avec les communautés d'accueil, installation dans des lieux peu sûrs ou inadéquats, ou retour forcé dans des zones dangereuses. Un des problèmes majeurs auxquels doivent faire face les personnes déplacées, en outre, est le fait de ne pas disposer de documents officiels, souvent parce qu'elles les ont oubliés en partant ou perdus pendant leur fuite, ce qui peut les empêcher d'avoir accès à des services essentiels tels que les soins de santé et l'éducation.

Le DIH contient également des dispositions importantes visant à prévenir le déplacement de civils et les souffrances qu'il cause. Il vise également à ce que, lorsque le déplacement a effectivement lieu, les personnes déplacées soient protégées et reçoivent une assistance à tous les stades de leur déplacement. Si le DIH n'est pas mieux respecté et si des efforts plus vigoureux ne sont pas déployés pour protéger la population civile pendant un conflit armé, les chiffres mondiaux du déplacement continueront d'augmenter.",268,"French"

Le suivi des flux de population (FMP) est une activité qui permet de quantifier et de qualifier les flux, les profils des migrants, les tendances et les routes migratoires sur un point d’entrée, de transit ou de sortie donné. En Guinée, quatre (4) points de suivi ont été installés depuis fin mars 2017 dans les localités frontalières avec Mali. Il s’agit des localités de Kouremalé, Nafadji, Balandougouba et Niantanina où l’on observe les mouvements des voyageurs en transit. Durant cette période la proportion des mineurs observés sur l’ensemble des points de suivi des flux s’élève à 7%. Cette infographie est un résumé des données collectées par le point de suivi de Niantanina pour la période du mois de juin 2017.

2374389,"Les défis de la prise en charge hospitalière des enfants malades en Afrique de l'Ouest Dr Mariama Issoufou, responsable d’étude au Burkina Faso, et Dr Susan Shepherd, experte en pédiatrie, travaillent en vue d’améliorer la prise en charge pédiatrique et nutritionnelle dans les programmes médicaux soutenus par ALIMA. Elles évoquent les problèmes majeurs rencontrés au quotidien en contexte humanitaire dans les hôpitaux d’Afrique de l’Ouest, et des solutions mises en place par ALIMA pour y répondre.

**Quels sont les défis les plus fréquemment rencontrés en Afrique de l’Ouest dans la prise en charge des cas pédiatriques en contexte humanitaire ?**

Dr Susan Shepherd : Le plus grand problème c’est, de loin, les maladies infectieuses. La plus grande difficulté, c’est que les enfants malades arrivent à l’hôpital dans un état grave, parfois sur le point de mourir. Souvent, ils présentent plusieurs problèmes simultanément, par exemple ils souffrent de déshydratation et d’une diarrhée infectieuse, une pneumonie ou le paludisme.

Dans ce genre de situation, sans examens de laboratoire, il peut être difficile de leur donner un traitement adapté. Le paludisme est détectable facilement, et est soigné avec des médicaments bien spécifiques. Mais les autres infections sont souvent traitées à l’aveugle, avec des antibiotiques. C’est un vrai défi de soigner ces enfants sans moyens pour identifier quel germe les rend malade ni quel serait le meilleur traitement pour chacun d’entre eux.  

Dr Mariama Issoufou : Au Burkina Faso, nous rencontrons un problème similaire avec les enfants malnutris : la plupart arrivent à l’hôpital dans un état sévère.

Le Burkina Faso est un des pays les plus touchés par les crises alimentaires et nutritionnelles. La malnutrition concernerait près de 8,5% des enfants de moins de cinq ans.

En fragilisant le système de défense immunitaire de l’enfant, la malnutrition favorise l’apparition de nouvelles pathologies comme par exemple les diarrhées ou les infections respiratoires. C’est pourquoi les enfants arrivent à l’hôpital très faibles.

Dans ces différents contextes quelles solutions ont été mises en place pour améliorer la prise en charge hospitalière de ces enfants ?

Mariama Issoufou : Dans le système classique, la malnutrition est prise en charge de manière différenciée selon le degré de gravité de l’état nutritionnel, modéré ou sévère, alors qu’il s’agit là du même processus physiologique. Au Burkina Faso, les enfants malnutris modérés ne sont pris en charge que dans 3 régions sur 13. Un des symptômes de la malnutrition est l’anorexie, de fait certains enfants refusant de manger tombent alors dans un épisode sévère de la maladie et nécessitent une hospitalisation. Les services de pédiatrie se retrouvent ainsi surchargés.

Pour éviter que les enfants tombent dans cet état sévère de la maladie et que trop d’enfants malnutris soient pris en charge dans les hôpitaux, ALIMA, en partenariat avec les autorités sanitaires du pays et les ONG partenaires SOS médecins et Keoogo, étudie un nouveau protocole de prise en charge, qui a pour ambition de traiter précocement les enfants dès le stade modéré, avant que leur état ne se détériore.

Concrètement, cela signifie que dans le district de Yako, ALIMA et ses partenaires admettent dans le programme de soins les enfants malnutris modérés, dont le périmètre brachial mesure entre 115 et 125 mm, et les traitent avec les mêmes aliments thérapeutiques que l’on utilise pour soigner les enfants malnutris sévères. On ajuste simplement les quantités de produit en fonction de la mesure du périmètre brachial et de l’évolution clinique de l’enfant.

Comme les enfants sont pris en charge plus précocement, il y a moins de cas compliqués et par conséquent moins d’enfants hospitalisés, et moins de décès.

Susan Shepherd : Pour améliorer la prise en charge, et in fine sauver plus d'enfants, nous devons aussi trouver les outils diagnostics adaptés à nos circonstances de travail, c'est-à-dire des tests praticables par tous les médecins et infirmiers après une formation simple.

Au Tchad, depuis 2016, ALIMA a introduit un test pour identifier les germes présents chez les enfants souffrant de diarrhée. Cette technologie, la biologie moléculaire multiplex, permet de tester un échantillon sur 22 germes différents. En utilisant ce test à N'Djamena, nous avons découvert que les enfants malnutris sévères souffrant de diarrhées sont souvent porteurs d’un parasite peu connu : le cryptosporidium. Grâce à cette découverte, nous avons pour ambition de commencer une étude pour voir si on peut traiter ce parasite. Sans ce test de biologie moléculaire, on aurait peut-être dû attendre encore des années avant de comprendre le problème.

Sur le même principe, au Niger, nous avons introduit un test qui permet de mesurer les électrolytes - entre autres, le sodium et le potassium - dans le sang. Nous avons découvert que beaucoup d’enfants qui souffrent de gastro-entérite ou du paludisme avaient des carences en potassium, une carence qui n’était pas corrigée par nos traitements habituels. Grâce à cette nouvelle technologie, nous mettons en place un nouveau protocole, dans lequel les enfants déshydratés seront systématiquement testés, pour pouvoir recevoir un supplément de potassium si besoin.

Pour résumer, si on veut améliorer la prise en charge des enfants malades en Afrique de l’Ouest, il faut que l’on puisse diagnostiquer correctement une maladie, avec des outils simples à la portée de tous. Ensuite, il nous faut adapter le traitement pour soigner les enfants avant qu’il ne soit trop tard. Et pour cela, il faut faire de la recherche, afin de tester de nouveaux protocoles et de nouveaux traitements.",268,"French"

Attaque jeudi passé dans la soirée de la Base de la Compagnie opérationnelle de la Force de la MONUSCO à Semiliki dans le territoire de Beni, dans le Nord-Kivu :  

Des présumés éléments de l’ADF ont mené cette attaque qui a entrainé des affrontements prolongés entre ce groupe rebelle et la Force de la MONUSCO.  

Le bilan s’établit comme suit : 14 morts du côté des casques bleus, et 44 blessés.  

Dans un communiqué publié dès vendredi 8 décembre, le Représentant spécial adjoint du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies en RDC, M. Maman Sambo Sidikou a transmis « ses sincères condoléances aux familles des casques bleus qui ont perdu leurs vies ou ont été blessés au service de la paix en République démocratique du Congo». Il a condamné « avec la dernière énergie cette attaque mortelle contre les casques bleus des Nations Unies et les soldats des FARDC. Les attaques dirigées contre ceux qui œuvrent au service de la paix et la stabilité en République démocratique du Congo sont des attaques lâches et constituent de graves violations.

A 16 ans, Odette*, qui avait quitté le Burundi en 2015 pour la République démocratique du Congo, a demandé au CICR son aide pour retourner au pays, et en novembre dernier, accompagnée de sa petite fille Fabiola*, elle a finalement retrouvé sa famille, dans la joie de tous.

Odette est ravie d'avoir retrouvé sa famille et d'être de retour au Burundi. La mère et la fille ont repris le cours de leur vie et Fabiola, qui a finalement rencontré ses grands-parents, est maintenant inscrite au registre d'état civil burundais. Aujourd'hui Odette participe à la vie de la famille et lui apporte un soutien précieux.

Chaque enfant qui quitte le pays et qui n'est pas accompagné d'un membre de sa famille peut bénéficier du l'aide du CICR pour être réuni avec sa famille. Les délégués du CICR constituent tout d'abord le dossier de l'enfant et, avec les collègues de la Croix Rouge du Burundi, mettent tout en œuvre pour permettre de localiser et identifier la famille restée au Burundi.  Une fois les parents localisés, et si tel est le souhait de l'enfant et de sa famille, le CICR entreprend toutes les démarches officielles en vue de les réunir. Une demande officielle est ensuite signée par les parents ainsi que par l'autorité locale, attestant notamment l'identité de l'enfant.

Avant d'organiser le retour de l'enfant, le CICR évalue également la situation familiale en discutant avec les parents, la communauté et les autorités locales. La transparence, l'implication et l'accord de toutes les parties, depuis le gouvernement burundais jusqu'au chef de secteur de la colline, sont des conditions obligatoires pour que le CICR organise le regroupement d'une famille.

Les trois thématiques ont été au centre de la conférence de presse hebdomadaire, mercredi à Bangui, avec les conseillères en genre et  en protection de la femme et le directeur adjoint de la division des droits de l’homme de la MINUSCA.      

Rappelant sa mission spécifiée dans la résolution 2387, Gladys Teni Atinga, conseillère en genre, a rappelé les principales réalisations de 2017 notamment «le développement des capacités des partenaires extérieurs, le partenariat, le plaidoyer, le coaching et les projets à impact rapide » au profit des femmes. A cet effet, la conseillère en genre a cité les projets du marché de Bomom, « en soutien aux activités de sensibilisation en faveur de la paix et de la cohésion sociale » ainsi que de la « réhabilitation de la prison de Mbaiki, en vue d’améliorer les conditions de vie des femmes détenues, de les protéger contre les abus et exploitations sexuels et de respecter de leur droit à la dignité en tant personne humaine ».

Pour sa part, Beatrix Attinger Colijn, conseillère en protection de la femme, a évoqué les neuf résolutions du Conseil de sécurité sur la thématique Femme, Paix et Sécurité, notamment la résolution 1960 (2010) qui prévoit « d’inclure dans les rapports annuels du Secrétaire général des informations détaillées sur les parties à un conflit armé qui sont crédibles soupçonnés d'avoir commis ou d'être responsables d'actes de viols ou d'autres formes de la violence sexuelle ». La conseillère a indiqué qu’un travail de partenariat avec les maires centrafricains et de sensibilisation des communautés a lieu, tout en soulignant qu’une des difficultés dans le combat aux violences contre les femmes et les filles en situation de conflit est liée à la stigmatisation des victimes.

De son côté, Cherifou Gassama, directeur adjoint de la division des droits de l’homme, a expliqué les domaines d’action de la MINUSCA à savoir la surveillance et l’investigation, le rapportage et l’alerte précoce ainsi que le dialogue constructif et l’assistance technique. « A propos de l’assistance pour le développement des capacités nationales, je citerai, entre autres, le partenariat avec le Ministère de la Justice et des droits de l’homme pour l’etablissement et l’opérationnalisation de la Commission nationale des droits de l’homme, le développement en cours de la stratégie nationale de protection des droits de l’Homme ainsi que le plaidoyer et l’assistance pour l’adoption et la mise en oeuvre des instruments liés à la lutte contre la torture et traitements inhumains et la prévention du génocide”, a dit Gassama.

Le directeur adjoint de la division des droits de l’homme a également donné un aperçu général de la situation des droits de l’homme entre mai et novembre 2O17. « Au total, 1816 cas de violations des droits de l’homme ont été documentés par la MINUSCA, surtout au centre et au sud-est de la Centrafrique, qui ont affecté 2977 victimes ; 1125 des violations sont imputables aux groupes armés contre  691 aux  agents de l’Etat », a-t-il indiqué. Selon ce responsable, “il y a un engagement régulier avec les autorités centrafricaines ainsi que les groupes armés pour trouver des réponses et pour rappeler les responsabilités face aux problèmes ».",268,"French"
2374299,"Afrique de l’Ouest : La Force conjointe du G5 Sahel devrait donner la priorité aux droits humains **L’État de droit et la bonne gouvernance sont cruciaux pour une stratégie de lutte contre le terrorisme**

(Banjul) – La force militaire du G5 Sahel créée pour combattre les groupes armés islamistes dans la région du Sahel en Afrique devrait respecter pleinement les droits humains internationaux et le droit international humanitaire dans ses opérations, a déclaré Human Rights Watch aujourd’hui. Les gouvernements qui soutiennent cette force regroupant des troupes de cinq pays devraient agir également pour améliorer la gouvernance et l’État de droit dans la région.

Les cinq pays participants – le [Mali](https://www.hrw.org/fr/africa/mali), la Mauritanie, le Burkina Faso, le Niger et le Tchad – ainsi que les principaux soutiens politiques et financiers, notamment la France, l’Allemagne, l’Union africaine, l’Union européenne, les États-Unis et l’Arabie saoudite, se réunissent le 13 décembre 2017 à Paris pour discuter de la mobilisation financière, militaire et politique de la Force. Une conférence des bailleurs de fonds se tiendra à Bruxelles le 14 décembre. La phase initiale des opérations du G5 Sahel, qui a commencé début novembre, sera chargée de sécuriser les frontières du Mali.

« Alors que la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel est confrontée à la présence croissante de groupes armés islamistes au Mali et ailleurs dans le Sahel, elle devra respecter scrupuleusement les droits dans ses opérations et garantir des enquêtes diligentes et impartiales sur les allégations d’abus commis par les membres de son personnel », a déclaré Corinne Dufka, Directrice adjointe de la division Afrique de Human Rights Watch. « Ne pas le faire ne ferait qu'augmenter le soutien local aux groupes armés et intensifier davantage encore la crise de sécurité. »

La Force conjointe du G5 Sahel, dont le quartier général est situé au centre du Mali, dans la ville de garnison de Sévaré, devrait comprendre 5 000 militaires appartenant à sept bataillons et elle coordonnera les opérations avec 4 000 militaires français opérant dans la région ainsi qu’avec les 12 000 membres de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA). Les forces de maintien de la paix fourniront un soutien logistique et opérationnel, comme les y autorise la [Résolution 2391 du Conseil de sécurité](https://reliefweb.int/node/2366904) du 8 décembre. L’UE s’est engagée à hauteur de 56 millions de dollars US, les États-Unis à hauteur de 60 millions de dollars US et l’Arabie Saoudite à hauteur de 100 millions de dollars US pour soutenir la force conjointe.

Les graves [abus commis par certaines forces de sécurité](https://reliefweb.int/node/2213379) participant à la précédente force multinationale soulignent la nécessité pour toutes les forces armées de réduire les dommages causés aux civils et d'assurer le traitement humain des prisonniers, conformément au droit international humanitaire et aux droits humains.

La Force conjointe du G5 Sahel concentrera l’essentiel de ses opérations au Mali, où la situation des droits humains est devenue de plus en plus précaire en 2017. Tout au long de l'année, les groupes armés islamistes ont multiplié les attaques contre les forces gouvernementales et les forces de maintien de la paix de l'ONU. Alors que le processus de paix envisagé pour mettre fin à la crise politico-militaire au Mali en 2012-2013 était au point mort, les groupes armés dans le nord ont peu progressé sur le désarmement promis et le gouvernement a fait des progrès insuffisants pour rétablir l'autorité de l'Etat. Cela a aggravé une absence de l’État de droit, facilitant un banditisme endémique.

La situation dans le centre du Mali soulève des préoccupations particulières, selon Human Rights Watch. Depuis 2015, des victimes d'abus et des témoins dans la région ont indiqué à Human Rights Watch que des combattants islamistes ont exécuté au moins 50 informateurs présumés, dont des chefs de village et des responsables locaux ; fermé les écoles ; forcé les femmes à se voiler ; recruté des enfants ; et ont battu des villageois qui se livraient à des pratiques culturelles interdites par les islamistes. Depuis fin 2016, ils ont également imposé leur version de la charia, établissant des tribunaux qui ne respectaient pas les normes d'équité.

Cependant, de nombreux villageois se sont félicités de la présence des groupes islamistes dans le centre du Mali, qu'ils considèrent comme une alternative bienveillante à un Etat qu'ils associent à une gouvernance prédatrice et abusive. De nombreux villageois ont déclaré qu'ils étaient satisfaits des efforts islamistes pour enquêter et punir les voleurs de bétail, y compris par des exécutions. Certains ont salué les jugements de la charia en faveur des victimes de violence domestique ou de l'abandon par leur conjoint. D'autres ont exprimé leur colère contre les abus de l'armée malienne lors des opérations antiterroristes.

En [septembre](https://reliefweb.int/node/2213379), Human Rights Watch a documenté de graves abus commis lors d’opérations militaires des forces du Mali et du Burkina Faso dans le centre du Mali. Depuis fin 2016, les forces maliennes se sont livrées à des exécutions extrajudiciaires, des disparitions forcées, des actes de torture et des arrestations arbitraires à l’encontre de personnes présumées soutenir des groupes armés islamistes, tandis qu'une opération effectuée en juin 2017 à travers la frontière par les forces burkinabés a donné lieu à des détentions arbitraires et s’est soldée par la mort de deux suspects.

En vertu des lois de la guerre, les civils ne peuvent pas être la cible délibérée d'une attaque, et les parties belligérantes sont tenues de prendre toutes les précautions possibles pour limiter les dommages causés aux civils et aux biens civils. Les attaques qui ne font pas de distinction entre les combattants et les civils, ou qui causeraient des dommages disproportionnés aux civils, sont interdites. Les abus contre les civils et les combattants capturés, notamment le meurtre, la torture et autres mauvais traitements, peuvent constituer un crime de guerre.

L'armée malienne a fait peu d'efforts pour réclamer des comptes aux militaires ou aux miliciens impliqués dans des abus au cours des années. Toutefois, en octobre, le ministère malien de la Défense [a promis l’ouverture d’une enquête interne](https://reliefweb.int/node/2307184) sur les abus qu’auraient commis leurs forces dans le centre du Mali. Les autorités du Burkina Faso ont également promis d’enquêter sur les allégations d’abus commis à Djibo.

Alors que les gouvernements du G5 Sahel et les intervenants apportant un soutien financier à la Force conjointe finalisent les plans opérationnels, ils devraient également aider le Mali à lutter contre les problèmes sous-jacents à des décennies d’insécurité et au soutien croissant aux groupes armés islamistes, selon Human Rights Watch.

« Une stratégie de lutte contre le terrorisme au Sahel devrait aller au-delà de la présence de groupes armés islamistes, mais elle doit également lutter contre les problèmes qui sont au cœur de l'insécurité : la faiblesse des institutions de l'État de droit et la gouvernance abusive », a conclu Corinne Dufka.

**Recommandations aux pays membres de la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel et à ses soutiens financiers**

- Inclure dans le processus de planification opérationnelle des avocats ayant l'expérience de l'application des lois de la guerre, des crimes de guerre et de la responsabilité de commandement ;

- Exhorter la section de la MINUSMA chargée des droits humains à s'engager dans davantage de rapports publics sur les violations des droits commises par toutes les parties ; et

- Veiller à ce que tous les enfants détenus pendant les opérations du G5 Sahel soient placés dans un centre de soins spécialisé temporaire géré par l'UNICEF, l'agence des Nations Unies pour les droits des enfants, conformément au protocole de 2013 sur la libération, le transfert et la protection des enfants associés à des groupes armés",268,"French"
2374279,"Niger : le PAM fournit une assistance alimentaire à plus de 750.000 personnes grâce à un soutien européen 13 décembre 2017 – Le Programme alimentaire mondial des Nations Unies (PAM) est en mesure de fournir une assistance vitale à environ 755.000 personnes au Niger grâce à une contribution de 10,7 millions d'euros de l'Union européenne (UE) et du Royaume-Uni.

« Nous exprimons notre plus sincère gratitude à l'Union européenne et au gouvernement britannique pour leur soutien continu et indéfectible », a déclaré le Représentant du PAM au Niger, Sory Ouane, cité dans un communiqué de presse.

« Cette année a été une nouvelle année difficile pour des centaines de milliers de personnes au Niger en raison de l'impact du changement climatique sur l'agriculture d'une part et de l'insécurité régionale de l'autre », a rappelé M. Ouane.

Les réfugiés, les rapatriés, les personnes déplacées à l'intérieur du pays et les femmes, les hommes et les enfants les plus vulnérables qui sont au cœur des opérations d'urgence du PAM au Niger bénéficient de cette aide financée par l'UE et le Royaume-Uni.

Dans la région de Diffa - qui est touchée par l'insurrection de Boko Haram dans le bassin du lac Tchad - plus de 210.000 personnes bénéficient d'une assistance grâce à l'aide de l'UE et du Royaume-Uni. À la frontière du Niger avec le Mali - une zone également confrontée à une grande instabilité – cet argent soutient plus de 60.000 réfugiés maliens avec une aide alimentaire.

En outre, grâce au soutien de l'UE et du Royaume-Uni, le PAM fournit une assistance alimentaire à quelque 290.000 personnes vulnérables pendant la période de soudure, lorsque les stocks alimentaires sont à un niveau bas et que les champs ne produisent pas encore de récoltes. Pendant cette saison, les personnes les plus vulnérables sont plus susceptibles de quitter leur foyer à la recherche d'un moyen de se nourrir.

Des études récentes au Niger ont montré que les personnes recevant une aide alimentaire et nutritionnelle du PAM sont moins susceptibles de migrer en ces temps difficiles et sont mieux équipées pour s'occuper de leurs terres, générer des revenus et subvenir aux besoins de leurs familles tout au long de l'année.",268,"French"
2374269,"Le chef des opérations de paix de l'ONU rend visite aux Casques bleus tanzaniens blessés dans une attaque en RDC 13 décembre 2017 – Le chef des opérations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies a remercié mercredi les Casques bleus qui se sont battus alors qu'ils étaient attaqués le 7 décembre dans la province du Nord-Kivu, en République démocratique du Congo (RDC).

« Merci beaucoup pour votre service. Je vous souhaite bonne chance », a déclaré Jean-Pierre Lacroix, le Secrétaire général adjoint aux opérations de maintien de la paix, à chaque soldat de la paix auprès de qui il s'est rendu à l'hôpital Nakasero de Kampala, en Ouganda.

Au moins 14 Casques bleus de la Mission des Nations Unies en RDC ([MONUSCO](https://www.un.org/fr/peacekeeping/missions/monusco/)) ont été tués dans cette attaque, l'un des bilans les plus meurtriers dans l'histoire des Casques bleus de l'ONU.

M. Lacroix doit rencontrer les familles des Casques bleus tués lors d'une visite en Tanzanie plus tard cette semaine.

La MONUSCO a rendu un hommage aux Casques bleus lundi à Beni, dans la province du Nord-Kivu, où a eu lieu l'attaque.

2374264,"La moitié de la population de la planète n’a pas accès aux services de santé essentiels 13 DÉCEMBRE 2017 | TOKYO - Il ressort d’un nouveau rapport de la Banque mondiale et de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé que la moitié au moins de la population de la planète n’a pas accès aux services de santé essentiels. Chaque année un nombre considérable de familles sont plongées dans la pauvreté en raison des dépenses de santé qu’elles doivent régler directement.

Actuellement, 800 millions de personnes consacrent au moins 10% du budget du ménage aux dépenses occasionnées par les soins, pour elles-mêmes, un enfant malade ou un autre membre de la famille. Le niveau de ces dépenses suffit à plonger 100 millions d’entre elles dans une situation d’extrême pauvreté où elles n’ont tout au plus que 1,90 dollar (US$) par jour pour survivre. Ces conclusions, rendues publiques aujourd’hui dans le rapport intitulé [Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2017 Global Monitoring Report](https://reliefweb.int/node/2373464), sont parues simultanément dans The Lancet Global Health.

Pour le Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Directeur général de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé, «il est totalement inacceptable que la moitié de la population de la planète n’ait toujours pas accès aux services de santé les plus essentiels. Et ce d’autant plus qu’une solution existe: la couverture sanitaire universelle (CSU) permet à chacun d’obtenir les services de santé dont il a besoin, quand et là où il en a besoin sans avoir à supporter d’importantes difficultés financières».

Comme l’a fait observer le Président du Groupe de la Banque mondiale, le Dr Jim Yong Kim, «le rapport fait clairement ressortir que si nous voulons vraiment non seulement améliorer la santé dans le monde mais aussi mettre fin à la pauvreté, nous devons d’urgence renforcer nos efforts pour la couverture sanitaire universelle. Les investissements en faveur de la santé, et plus généralement de la population, sont indispensables pour renforcer le capital humain et permettre une croissance économique durable et inclusive. Mais le système est cassé nous devons modifier de manière fondamentale notre façon de mobiliser des ressources pour la santé et pour le capital humain, surtout au niveau des pays. Nous intervenons sur de nombreux fronts pour aider les pays à consacrer aux gens davantage de ressources de manière plus efficace et à progresser plus rapidement vers la couverture sanitaire universelle».

Des signes encourageants sont néanmoins perceptibles: le rapport montre que le nombre des personnes ayant accès à certains services de santé essentiels comme la vaccination et la planification familiale, ainsi qu’au traitement antirétroviral contre le VIH et aux moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide pour prévenir le paludisme, a augmenté depuis le début du siècle et les familles sont également moins nombreuses aujourd’hui à être plongées dans la pauvreté.

Les progrès restent cependant très inégaux.

Les services sont très fragmentaires en Afrique subsaharienne et en Asie méridionale. Ailleurs, il devient plus facile d’obtenir des services de base comme la planification familiale et la vaccination du nourrisson mais, faute d’une protection financière suffisante, les familles obligées d’en supporter directement les frais sont confrontées à des difficultés financières croissantes. Le problème touche même des régions plus favorisées comme l’Asie orientale, l’Amérique latine et l’Europe où un nombre croissant de ménages consacrent au moins 10% de leur budget aux paiements directs pour la santé.

Les inégalités sont constatées non seulement entre pays mais aussi à l’intérieur d’un même pays et les moyennes nationales dissimulent parfois la faible couverture assurée aux groupes désavantagés. Ainsi, 17% seulement des mères et des enfants du quintile des ménages les plus pauvres dans les pays à revenu faible ou intermédiaire de la tranche inférieure bénéficient de six au moins des sept interventions fondamentales de santé de la mère et de l’enfant, contre 74% dans le quintile des ménages les plus favorisés.

Le rapport est l’un des principaux points abordés au Forum mondial de la couverture sanitaire universelle 2017 qui se déroule actuellement à Tokyo. Organisé par le gouvernement japonais, un des principaux promoteurs de la CSU au niveau national et dans le monde, le Forum est coparrainé par l’Agence japonaise de coopération internationale (JICA), UHC2030 (principal mouvement pour la promotion de la CSU), l’UNICEF, la Banque mondiale et l’OMS.

Le Premier Ministre japonais, Shinzo Abe, le Secrétaire général de l’Organisation des Nations Unies, António Guterres, le Président de la Banque mondiale, Jim Yong Kim, le Directeur général de l’OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, et le Directeur général de l’UNICEF, Anthony Lake, seront tous présents de même que les chefs d’État et les ministres de plus d’une trentaine de pays.

Comme l’a souligné Katsunobu Kato, Ministre japonais de la santé, du travail et du bien être, «les expériences du passé nous ont montré que la mise sur pied d’un dispositif de financement solide de la santé protégeant chaque personne vulnérable contre les difficultés financières, ainsi que des établissements et des personnels de santé, médecins compris, pouvant apporter les services nécessaires là où les gens vivent, revêtent une importance critique dans l’optique de la santé pour tous. Je suis convaincu que ces premiers investissements en faveur de la CSU consentis jadis par l’ensemble du gouvernement japonais ont constitué un important facteur qui a permis par la suite le développement économique rapide du pays».

Le Forum est le point culminant d’une série de manifestations qui se déroulent dans plus d’une centaine de pays depuis le 12 décembre – Journée de la couverture sanitaire universelle – pour marquer l’élan mondial croissant de la CSU. Il vise à illustrer l’engagement politique très marqué de haut niveau en faveur de la CSU mondialement et dans les pays, à mettre l’accent sur les expériences des pays qui ont été les pionniers de la CSU et à développer les connaissances sur les moyens de renforcer les systèmes de santé et de promouvoir la CSU de manière efficace.

Les principales séances de haut niveau du Forum se dérouleront demain, le 14 décembre, avec notamment une «vitrine de l’innovation» qui durera toute la journée mettant l’accent sur les innovations à l’origine des progrès dans les systèmes de santé du monde entier et une manifestation publique en soirée pour marquer l’événement. La Déclaration de Tokyo sur la couverture sanitaire universelle – un engagement en faveur de l’action – sera rendue publique lors de la cérémonie de clôture du Forum.

Comme l’a fait observer le Directeur général de l’UNICEF, Anthony Lake, «sans soins de santé, comment les enfants peuvent-ils s’épanouir pleinement? Et sans une population productive en bonne santé, comment les sociétés peuvent-elles réaliser leurs aspirations? La couverture sanitaire universelle peut contribuer à l’égalité des chances dont doivent jouir les enfants aujourd’hui et les aider à sortir demain du cercle vicieux de la pauvreté et de la maladie.»

S’inspirant du Sommet du G7 à Ise-Shima et du Sommet de la TICAD VI en 2016, qui ont tous deux souligné l’importance de la CSU, le Forum de Tokyo apparaît comme une étape marquante des progrès en vue d’atteindre la cible de la CSU d’ici 2030 – un élément essentiel des objectifs du développement durable. Les pays pourront ensuite se préparer au prochain événement mondial: la réunion de haut niveau de l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies sur la CSU en 2019.

**Note aux rédactions**

Le Rapport UHC Global Monitoring Report de la Banque mondiale et de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé, qui est publié régulièrement, mesure la proportion de la population pouvant accéder à des services de santé essentiels de qualité et la proportion de la population consacrant une part importante du revenu familial à la santé. Il évalue aussi le niveau global de la CSU et la mesure dans laquelle elle est équitable – offrant une couverture par des services et une protection financière à chacun, notamment les plus démunis et les groupes vivant dans des zones rurales reculées. Le rapport utilise 16 services de santé essentiels comme indicateurs du niveau et de l’équité de la couverture dans les pays.

CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ   
8134E SÉANCE – MATIN

La situation globale en Afrique centrale demeure marquée par des tensions sociopolitiques, des difficultés économiques et des attaques et « abus horribles » perpétrés par des groupes armés contre les civils, a expliqué ce matin, devant le Conseil de sécurité, le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général et Chef du Bureau régional des Nations Unies pour l’Afrique centrale (BRENUAC), M. François Louncény Fall.

M. Fall, qui présentait le dernier [rapport](http://undocs.org/fr/S/2017/465)* du Secrétaire général sur la question, a plaidé pour une approche nationale, régionale et internationale « concertée » afin d’éviter toute dégradation de la situation et a insisté sur l’engagement de son bureau en vue de faciliter le règlement politique des conflits et crises qui émaillent la région. 

« Au Tchad, j’ai encouragé le Gouvernement et les chefs d’opposition à discuter les modalités d’un dialogue inclusif et d’un calendrier en vue de parvenir à des propositions de solutions aux défis économiques et de gouvernance que connaît ce pays et de s’accorder sur les réformes qui créeront les conditions favorables à la tenue des élections législatives », a-t-il affirmé. 

S’agissant de la République du Congo, M. Fall a indiqué que des figures bien connues de l’opposition étaient toujours emprisonnées sans avoir été jugées, tandis que la situation sécuritaire dans la région du Pool demeurait précaire.  « Lors de mes visites dans ce pays, j’ai souligné l’importance de stabiliser la région du Pool et d’opérationnaliser les plateformes du dialogue politique et social. »

Au Cameroun, le Représentant spécial a indiqué que la moitié de la population était affectée soit par les activités de Boko Haram dans le nord du pays, soit par la crise en République centrafricaine, dans l’est, soit par le mouvement séparatiste anglophone, dans les régions du nord-ouest et du sud-ouest.  « Nous devons redoubler nos efforts de prévention afin d’éviter une aggravation des tensions », a-t-il dit, en rappelant que des élections sont prévues en 2018.

M. Fall a indiqué que les griefs exprimés par les populations dans les régions anglophones du Cameroun étaient une source de vive préoccupation.  S’il a salué les mesures de réforme des secteurs éducatif et judiciaire prises par le Gouvernement, ainsi que la libération d’un certain nombre de dirigeants anglophones, il a souligné le besoin d’un dialogue plus fondamental sur la question de la gouvernance afin de remédier au sentiment de marginalisation ressenti par la population. 

« Au Gabon, le contexte national est caractérisé par la persistance du ralentissement économique et des mouvements de grève, les scandales de corruption, ainsi que le débat sur un projet controversé de réforme constitutionnelle », a continué M. Fall.  Il a expliqué que l’opposition et une partie de la société civile critiquaient la méthode utilisée, considérée comme non inclusive et illégitime, ainsi que la substance de la réforme constitutionnelle qui représente, selon elles, un « recul démocratique ». 

Le Représentant spécial a indiqué que la réforme devrait être adoptée par le Parlement, où le parti au pouvoir détient une majorité des deux tiers, et que la voie référendaire ne semblait pas envisagée.  Le candidat malheureux à la dernière élection présidentielle, M. Jean Ping, continue à contester la réélection, en 2016, du Président Ali Bongo Ondimba et à refuser de participer à un dialogue avec ce dernier, a-t-il insisté. 

Préoccupé par la situation en République centrafricaine, marquée par des attaques et des abus graves perpétrés par des groupes armés, M. Fall a jugé urgent que le processus de paix progresse, dans le cadre de l’Initiative africaine. 

Le Chef du BRENUAC a salué le lancement des activités du groupe des médiateurs de l’Initiative africaine en République centrafricaine à la fin du mois de novembre dernier, suivi de ses premiers contacts avec des groupes armés actifs dans le pays. 

« Il est maintenant important de ne pas perdre cet élan pendant la période cruciale à venir », a-t-il poursuivi, en soulignant la nécessité d’un engagement entier de la région dans le processus de paix.  Cet engagement est essentiel, pas seulement pour soutenir politiquement l’Initiative africaine, mais aussi en vue d’apporter des réponses collectives aux dynamiques transfrontalières qui ont un impact sur le conflit centrafricain, notamment la transhumance et les trafics, a affirmé le Chef du BRENUAC. 

Le Représentant spécial a ensuite appelé à un redoublement des efforts pour régler de « manière holistique » la crise causée par Boko Haram, qui a toujours la capacité de mener des attaques et de commettre des « abus horribles ».  Les conclusions de la récente conférence régionale pour la stabilisation du bassin du lac Tchad, organisée par la Commission de l’Union africaine et la Commission du bassin du lac Tchad, doivent être mises en œuvre, a continué M. Fall. 

S’agissant de l’Armée de résistance du Seigneur (LRA), le Chef du BRENUAC a rappelé que les zones dans lesquelles ce groupe opère faisaient face à une myriade de défis sécuritaires, notamment la transhumance, une autorité étatique défaillante et des activités de contrebande.  « Il est important pour l’Union africaine et les pays contributeurs à la Force régionale d’intervention de l’Union africaine de s’accorder rapidement sur la reconfiguration de ladite force et à appuyer davantage la formation des forces armées centrafricaines. » 

M. Fall a salué les avancées de l’intégration régionale, la liberté de circulation étant désormais devenue la réalité au sein de la Communauté économique et monétaire de l’Afrique centrale (CEMAC).  « Mon bureau a continué d’appuyer ce processus d’intégration, y compris en plaidant pour une réforme institutionnelle du Secrétariat de la Communauté économique des États de l’Afrique centrale (CEEAC) et pour une rationalisation de cette organisation ainsi que de la CEMAC », a-t-il affirmé. 

En conclusion, le Représentant spécial a assuré que son bureau continuerait de mettre l’accent sur la cohérence et la coordination des activités de l’ONU dans la région.  Cela comprend une bonne coopération avec les coordonnateurs résidents de l’ONU et les équipes de pays en vue d’engager les autorités nationales sur des questions politiques sensibles et les efforts de long terme de consolidation de la paix, a conclu M. Fall. 

Le représentant de l’Uruguay a attiré l’attention sur la gravité de la crise humanitaire et de celle des droits de l’homme qui prévalent en Afrique centrale.  S’il s’est inquiété des agissements de Boko Haram dans le bassin du lac Tchad, où 2,4 millions de personnes sont déplacées et plus de sept millions ont besoin d’une aide alimentaire, il a également insisté sur la répression politique, la hausse des détentions arbitraires et l’usage disproportionné de la force. 

Son homologue de la Bolivie a suggéré que l’initiative de la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel soit « imitée » en Afrique centrale pour lutter contre Boko Haram.  Une autre avancée majeure en faveur des processus de paix dans la région serait, pour sa délégation, de renforcer la participation des femmes, un point de vue également défendu par l’Uruguay.

2373974,"Les fondamentaux du marché des denrées de base et du betail au Burkina Faso **Sommaire exécutif**

Ce rapport de FEWS NET sur les Fondamentaux du marché présente les résultats pour informer le suivi et l’analyse réguliers du marché au Burkina Faso. Ce rapport était préparé simultanément avec un rapport d’Analyse approfondie du marché (Enhanced Market Analysis, EMA), en mettant l'accent sur les Régions du Centre Nord et l’Est du Burkina Faso (Figure 1). Parmi d’autres utilisations, les informations présentées conjointement dans ces deux rapports pourraient être utilisées pour soutenir la conception des programmes de sécurité alimentaire, y compris, mais sans s'y limiter, informer une détermination de Bellmon par l’Agence des États-Unis pour le développement international (USAID) pour l’année fiscale 2018.

La disponibilité alimentaire au Burkina Faso provient surtout de la production nationale, avec des importations à la hausse en riz. Le sorgho, le mil, et le maïs sont les principales céréales sèches produites et consommées au Burkina Faso. Le pays est autosuffisant en sorgho et mil, et produit un excédent en maïs. Ce dernier devient de plus en plus prononcé depuis la dernière décennie. Le riz occupe une place importante dans le panier alimentaire, surtout parmi les ménages urbains. Le riz consommé provient à moitié de la production locale et à moitié des importations internationales.
La production agricole au Burkina Faso est largement pluviale, et est donc tributaire des aléas climatiques qui résultent en variations spatiales et temporelles importantes. Seuls les systèmes de production de riz local utilisent l’irrigation, avec des superficies irriguées en riz restreintes. La production irriguée connaît des variations interannuelles légèrement moins élevées que l’agriculture pluviale.

Depuis l’année 2000 la disponibilité locale en céréales sèches suit une tendance à la hausse, d’une moyenne de plus de 3,2 millions de tonnes entre 2001 et 2005 à plus de 4,4 millions de tonnes entre 2011 et 2015. Cette évolution a été surtout influencée par une augmentation continue de la production de maïs-grains. Le riz connaît également une évolution importante en termes relatifs (% hausse), mais reste faible en comparaison avec les autres céréales sèches.

Bien que le pays connaisse des tendances agrégées, il existe des différentes tendances spatiales importantes. Les régions à l’ouest du pays, dans la zone agro-climatique soudano–guinéenne, connaissent des excédents structurels. Au centre (zone de consommation) et vers le nord du pays, le Soudano-Sahel et le Sahel connaissent des déficits. Sur le plan national, les échanges se font donc entre les zones excédentaires et les zones déficitaires du pays.

Les marchés au Burkina Faso connaissent deux grandes tendances concernant leur structure. La production et le commerce de la production locale se font presque entièrement par les petits producteurs, les collecteurs et les grossistes. Par contre, le commerce des produits importés (surtout le riz) se fait en gros par les grandes sociétés ayant les moyens financiers pour faire les achats sur les marchés internationaux. Les mécanismes de fixation de prix varient également selon les sources, avec les prix des produits locaux déterminés par les lois de l’offre et la demande, tandis que les prix des produits importés sont souvent déterminés en fonction des négoces entre les sociétés privées et le gouvernement.

Le Burkina Faso joue un rôle central dans les échanges commerciaux régionaux, surtout dans le bassin central (Burkina Faso, Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana et Togo). Le Burkina Faso assure également l’offre des céréales (surtout le maïs, mais d’autres cultures aussi) dans les régions frontalières à l’est du Niger. Ces échanges agricoles sont soutenus par les accords régionaux de l’UEMOA et de la CEDEAO. Néanmoins, les politiques nationales et même infranationales ont le pouvoir d’empêcher ces échanges pour protéger la disponibilité alimentaire nationale, surtout en année de crise.
Bien que des améliorations se fassent régulièrement sur le plan de la production, le stockage constitue un des maillions les plus faibles des chaînes de commercialisation au Burkina Faso, surtout en zone rurale. À l’inverse, les grands importateurs des produits de première nécessité (riz, blé, sucre, huile végétale) disposent de magasins de stockage importants, surtout dans les grands centres urbains. La structure nationale de gestion des stocks, la SONAGESS, gère également l’achat et la distribution (vente et dons) des stocks nationaux, qui varient entre 45.000 and 60.000 tonnes.
Les prix des céréales sèches suivent typiquement des tendances saisonnières avec des baisses pendant la période des récoltes (septembre-novembre) et des hausses durant le pic de la période de soudure (juin/juillet). Par contre, les prix des produits importés des marchés internationaux varient selon les cours internationaux, les politiques de fixation de prix et les taux de change (USD/XOF), car les échanges se font en USD.

L’élevage (surtout des petits ruminants) constitue une source de revenu importante pour les ménages pauvres au Burkina Faso. Il existe deux systèmes de production agricole (rurale extensive et intensive urbaine/périurbaine) dont les systèmes de production rurale extensive, qui dominent largement dans les régions du le nord du pays. Le Burkina Faso produit un excédent en produits d’élevage. Les ventes de bétail burkinabè se font sur le plan régional, avec des exportations jusqu’au Nigeria et vers d’autres pays côtiers (Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire entre autres).

La production du niébé suit une tendance à la hausse depuis une dizaine d’années. Néanmoins, la production évolue en dents de scie en fonction de la performance agro climatologique saisonnière, ainsi que des incitations qui se présentent sur les marchés. La consommation se fait surtout dans les centres urbains, les zones minières, et les exportations se font vers les marchés régionaux (surtout les pays côtiers).

Les oléagineux et huiles alimentaires constituent aussi des produits de grande consommation au Burkina Faso. La production nationale d’huile, estimée à plus de 65.000 tonnes en moyenne entre 2010 et 2014, provient principalement du coton-graine. Il y a aussi des quantités de production faibles à négligeables d’huiles d’arachide, de sésame, de karité et de soja. Mais, l’offre nationale ne couvre pas la demande, estimée à plus de 150.000 tonnes, nécessitant de grandes quantités d’huiles importées, surtout l’huile de palme, principalement en provenance de la Côte d’Ivoire.

Le Burkina Faso possède un dispositif assez solide de collecte d’informations sur les produits agricoles. La responsabilité de ces activités incombe à différents acteurs, dont les SIM de la SONAGESS et du bétail, les structures et agences du gouvernement et le secteur privé. Cependant, le système de suivi et de collecte d’information des marchés au Burkina Faso souffrent de plusieurs faiblesses telles que les contraintes de ressources financières, les ressources humaines, ou encore la gestion des données.",268,"French"

Bruxelles, le 13 décembre 2017

Le Niger est un pays prioritaire pour l'Union Européenne qui travaille en étroite collaboration avec le pays dans le cadre de la stratégie de sécurité et de développement au Sahel ainsi que dans le nouveau cadre pour les partenariats de migration.

**Un contexte complexe**

Le pays est confronté à de nombreux défis: sécurité, migration, environnement, démographie, développement et situation humanitaire. En 2016, le pays occupait l'avant dernier rang de l'Indice de développement humain du Programme des Nations Unies pour le développement (PNUD), malgré les progrès réalisés ces dernières années en matière de croissance économique et de développement social. La situation concernant la sécurité alimentaire est structurellement fragile en raison des mauvaises récoltes liées aux sécheresses et aux inondations récurrentes (conséquences du changement climatique). La croissance démographique reste un énorme défi pour le gouvernement du Niger, avec un accroissement de la population de 3,9% et un taux de fécondité de 7,6 enfants pour des femmes.

La situation socioéconomique et sécuritaire du Niger s'est fortement crispée au cours de des dernières années et notamment en 2017 notamment à cause des menaces criminelles et terroristes croissantes, avec les crises humanitaires qui en résultent, dans la région du Lac Tchad et dans les zones frontalières avec le Mali et avec la Libye. Environ 260.000 déplacés, réfugiés ou retournés, victimes de cette insécurité, demeurent quant à eux largement dépendants de l'aide internationale, en particulier humanitaire. L'opérationnalisation en cours de la force conjointe G5 Sahel devrait participer à réduire ces menaces sécuritaires.

Malgré ces fragilités et défis, des progrès importants ont été accomplis ces dernières années, dans le secteur économique et du développement. Cela a pu se faire grâce aux efforts considérables déployés par le gouvernement pour s'engager sur la voie des réformes, selon le «Plan de développement économique et social» (PDES) 2013-2016, dont la nouvelle version 2017-2021 fait l'objet d'une présentation lors de la table ronde du 13 et 14 décembre à Paris. Ces réformes doivent être consolidées pour continuer sur la voie du développement. L'Union européenne soutient et continuera à soutenir le Niger dans cette voie.

**La coopération entre l'UE et le Niger**

Conformément à l'approche intégrée de l'UE, le soutien européen mobilise tous les instruments disponibles pour renforcer les capacités du gouvernement dans les domaines de la gouvernance, de la sécurité, de la lutte contre la migration irrégulière et la traite, des actions humanitaires et du développement durable dans toutes ses dimensions.

L'enveloppe financière donnée par l'Union européenne au pays pour le développement (programme indicatif national) s'élève à 596 millions d'euros au titre du 11e Fonds européen de développement (FED), pour la période 2014 à 2020. 75% de cette enveloppe est fourni sous forme d'appui budgétaire, afin de soutenir et de renforcer les capacités de l'Etat notamment dans les domaines de la justice, la bonne gestion des finances publiques, la sécurité, l'éducation et la sécurité alimentaire.
Auparavant, dans le cadre du 10e Fonds européen de développement (2008-2013), le Niger avait pu bénéficier de 508 millions d'euros, consacrés à trois domaines: développement rural et sécurité alimentaire, intégration régionale et gouvernance. 35% du financement a été fourni sous la forme d'un appui budgétaire dans le but de soutenir les efforts du pays pour augmenter l'accès aux services sociaux de base, protéger les groupes vulnérables de la population et promouvoir la bonne gouvernance et l'état de droit.
Exemples de coopération avec le Niger:

**Contrat de Réforme Sectorielle pour la Sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle et le développement agricole durable (SANAD) 243 millions d'euros de 2016 à 2020**

La sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle et le développement de l´agriculture durable constitue le premier levier de développement et d'éradication de la pauvreté du pays car il concerne 80% de la population et constitue l'approvisionnement en matière première pour l'émergence d'un secteur agro-alimentaire fort. Ce programme d'appui budgétaire prévoit d'accroître la capacité financière du gouvernement afin qu'il réalise les objectifs fixés en matière de politique sectorielle, renforcer la gouvernance et promouvoir les politiques et les réformes sectorielles dans le secteur; et répondre aux besoins essentiels de la population à travers l'amélioration de l'accès aux services dans les domaines de l'agriculture durable, la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle.

Ce programme permettra par exemple de faire passer le taux d'accès national à l'eau potable à 65% en 2020, et de diminuer de 1% chaque année la prévalence de la malnutrition chronique chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans.

**Contrat de Réforme Sectorielle pour l'Education, 77 millions d'euros de 2016 à 2019**

Le programme d'appui budgétaire sectoriel dans le secteur de l'éducation vise à soutenir les efforts du gouvernement du Niger en matière d'amélioration de l'accès équitable, de la qualité et de la gouvernance de l'éducation. Parmi les principales réformes ciblées figure celle relative à la réduction des inégalités dans l'accès à l'éducation, surtout au niveau des enseignements primaire et secondaire ; en effet, en plus du respect du droit fondamental à l'éducation, le maintien des filles à l'école présente un lien étroit avec la baisse de l'occurrence du mariage précoce et de la fécondité, contribuant ainsi à une meilleure maitrise de la croissance démographique. Le CRS Education soutient également le renforcement de la qualité des apprentissages scolaires et de l'efficacité du système éducatif, notamment par l'appui aux réformes dans les domaines de la gestion des enseignants et des finances publiques.

Ce programme a notamment contribué à faire progresser le taux net de scolarisation de 62,6% en 2013 à 66,1% en 2017 et d'améliorer nettement le taux d'achèvement au primaire qui est passé de 78.4% en 2016 à 83% en 2017.

**Le Fonds d'urgence pour la stabilité et pour la lutte contre les causes profondes de la migration irrégulière et des personnes déplacées en Afrique**

Afin de gérer la migration et les déplacements en Afrique, la Commission européenne a créé un «Fonds d'urgence pour la stabilité et la lutte contre les causes profondes de la migration irrégulière et des personnes déplacées en Afrique». Ce fonds fiduciaire bénéficie à un large éventail de pays en Afrique, en particulier ceux chez qui passent les principales routes africaines de migration vers l'Europe. Le Niger en fait partie.

Neuf actions pour un montant de 190 millions d'euros ont déjà été approuvées en faveur du Niger dans le cadre de ce Fonds fiduciaire. Ces projets constituent une réponse concrète de l'Union européenne aux engagements faits dans le cadre du Plan d'Action adopté au Sommet de Valette les 11 et 12 novembre 2015, et dans lequel le Niger a joué un rôle très actif et constructif. Le Niger est le principal bénéficiaire du Fonds fiduciaire à ce jour. Les activités du fonds fiduciaire d'urgence au Niger se concentrent à protéger les migrants et faciliter la réintégration, renforcer les capacités du gouvernement à lutter contre les réseaux criminels et à mieux gérer ses frontières, ainsi que soutenir les populations hôtes en créant des alternatives économiques pour les populations vivant des activités liées aux migrations irrégulières.

Le Niger bénéficie également d'un financement provenant d'instruments régionaux (Plan indicatif régional pour l'Afrique de l'Ouest, programmes intra-ACP), de lignes thématiques et d'autres instruments tels que l'Instrument contribuant à la Stabilité et à la Paix et l'Instrument européen pour la démocratie et les droits de l'homme.

Un exemple de projet concernant la migration au Niger est le programme ""Mécanisme de réponse et de ressources pour les Migrants"" (7 millions d'euros). ainsi que ""Initiative FFU – OIM pour la protection et la réintégration des migrants"" (15 millions d'euros de 2016 à 2020). Ce projet vise à soutenir la réponse du Niger aux flux migratoires complexes qui traversent son territoire, notamment en promouvant le développement économique et social à travers les migrations circulaires. L'objectif est d'aider les autorités nationales et régionales à développer leur gouvernance en matière de migration grâce à ce mécanisme. De mai à mi-novembre 2017, l'Initiative a permis le retour volontaire et l'assistance à l'arrivée de 3603 migrants à partir du Niger. Presque 49 000 migrants ont bénéficié d'activités de sensibilisation depuis avril 2017.",268,"French"
2373804,"République démocratique du Congo: Matrice de suivi des déplacements - Province du Kasaï Central, Rapport N°2: Novembre 2017 **Déplacements forcés et Retours au Kasai Central Rapport d’évaluation**

En réponse à la crise humanitaire qui affecte actuellement la région du Kasaï, l‘OIM a débuté en août 2017 son projet de matrice de suivi des déplacements (Displacement Tracking Matrix en anglais-DTM). L‘objectif de ce projet est de fournir des informations de base concernant les personnes déplacées et retournées dans la région. Ces résultats permettront de mieux comprendre les dynamiques du déplacement forcé au Kasai Central et d’adapter la réponse humanitaire aux réalités observées.
  
La méthodologie et les outils mis en œuvre dans les programmes DTM menés par l‘OIM dans différents pays du monde ont été utilisés pour ces évaluations. Les équipes de terrain se sont rendus dans tous les villages accessibles de la province du Kasaï Central, et ont collecté les données auprès des informateurs clés. Durant ces deux évaluations, un total de 3478 villages ont été évalués et 5756 personnes interrogées. Les premières évaluations DTM ont eu lieu du 26 août au 16 septembre 2017 (Phase 1). La seconde évaluation s’est déroulée du 17 au 31 novembre 2017 (Phase 2). La phase 2 concerne les évaluations effectuées dans les villages qui n’avaient pas été enquêtés lors de la première phase. Ce rapport présente les résultats compilés de ces deux phases de collecte.  

Ces évaluations ont été réalisées par les organisations non-gouvernementales,  
Coopérative Réveil Kananga et TDH-Unité de médiation en collaboration avec la Division Provinciale de la Santé.  

Le territoire de Kananga où se concentrent 30% des déplacés est le plus touché par le déplacement forcé. Kazumba et Demba sont les principaux territoires accueillant des retournés (respectivement 23 et 21% du total des retournés). Les individus ont été principalement déplacés à l’intérieur du Kasai Central. Toutefois, 36% des PDI proviennent de la province du Kasai. Les résultats présentés dans ce rapport sont basés sur des estimations des informateurs interrogés pour chaque village.",268,"French"
2373639,"RD Congo - Sud-Kivu & Maniema : Note d’informations humanitaires du 12/12/2017 **Faits saillants**

- Nouveaux mouvements de population dans les hauts-plateaux d’Uvira

- Plus de 7 000 ménages de la zone de santé de Nundu ciblés par une distribution Cash multisectoriel 

**Aperçu de la situation** 

Le groupement de Bijombo, dans les hauts-plateaux d’Uvira, a une fois de plus été le théâtre de mouvements de population. Quelque 3 400 personnes ont fui des affrontements entre des milices intercommunautaires et un groupe armé entre le 4 et le 5 décembre. Depuis février 2016, les déplacements sont légion dans cette région difficile d’accès, en proie à des affrontements récurrents. Entre septembre et novembre, une certaine accalmie due au déploiement d’éléments de l’armée congolaise dans la zone avait toutefois permis le retour d’environ 3 000 personnes qui s’étaient déplacées entre avril et mai 2017 (Note d’informations humanitaires du 28 novembre 2017). 

Les mouvements de population se sont également poursuivis en Territoire de Fizi. D’après les informations des partenaires locaux, les 2 200 habitants du village de Kichula, à une trentaine de kilomètres à l’ouest de Baraka, ont fui le 5 décembre des affrontements entre des groupes armés et l’armée congolaise. L’attaque d’un groupe armé le 8 décembre sur une position de l’armée congolaise à Kikwama, à une dizaine de kilomètres de Baraka, a également forcé environ la moitié de la population du village, soit quelque 600 personnes, à se déplacer, indique les sources locales. Pour l’heure, seul 10% de ces dernières seraient de retour.  

Sur les 176 000 personnes qui se sont déplacées en 2017 au Sud-Kivu, 103 000 l’ont été en Territoire de Fizi selon les dernières données consolidées par OCHA. Ces chiffres vont encore s’aggraver avec la prise en compte des informations récoltées durant la récente mission d’évaluation multisectorielle menée du 29 novembre au 3 décembre dans ce territoire. Il en ressort que 38 000 nouveaux déplacés ont été accueillis dans différentes localité situées sur les axes Fizi-Lumanya, Malinde-Fizi et Baraka-Sebele entre octobre et novembre.  

Le Sud-Kivu a également été touché ces dernières semaines par plusieurs tremblements de terre. Le Territoire de Walungu, principalement les groupements de Burhale, Irongo et Walungu, a été particulièrement affecté par les secousses sismiques qui se sont produites du 20 novembre au 5 décembre, explique Caritas. Au moins trentequatre salles de classe ont été endommagées (fissures dans les murs, écroulement) dans ces trois groupements. Les élèves sont obligés de se regrouper dans les pièces encore intactes, ce qui péjore leurs conditions d’apprentissage, relève l’ONG.",268,"French"

2373524,"Amdjarass abrite un forum sur la cohabitation pacifique entre les réfugiés et les populations autochtones Tanel Sylvain Djimadoumnodji  
Programme Assistant, UNHCR FO Amdjarass  

Amdjarass – Un forum sur la cohabitation pacifique s’est tenu du 04 au 05 décembre 2017 à Amdjarass. Ce forum, organisé conjointement par le HCR en collaboration avec ses partenaires HIAS et APLFT, était placé sous la présidence du Secrétaire Général de la région de l’Ennedi Est, M. MAAB Mara. 

Le forum a réuni les communautés d’accueil, les leaders réfugiés du camp d’Ouré Cassoni, les autorités civiles et militaires d’Amdjarass et Bahaï, les chefs des services techniques sis à Amdjarass, les autorités traditionnelles de la zone, ainsi que les représentants des partenaires du HCR œuvrant au camp et dans les villages avoisinants le camp. Au total, soixante-cinq (65) personnes y ont pris part. 

Après le mot d’ouverture du forum par le Secrétaire General de la Région, représentant le Gouverneur empêché, le chef de bureau du HCR d’Amdjarass a situé le contexte actuel de l’opération de son Agence au Tchad et sa priorité de consolider la cohabitation pacifique entre les communautés réfugiées et tchadiennes. 

Les participants de la rencontre ont passé en revue les sources de tension entre les deux communautés et les obstacles à la cohabitation pacifique et fait des propositions pour renforcer les relations entre les deux populations. 

Les présentations ont souligné les réalisations faites par le HCR et ses partenaires en faveur des communautés pour la consolidation de la coexistence pacifique. 

Les intervenants ont également évoqué les droits et devoirs des réfugiés, des présentations sur les réalisations du HCR en faveur de la cohabitation pacifique, la responsabilité de protéger et le rôle de la CNARR, les droits et devoirs des réfugiés, et les techniques de gestion des conflits liés à la gestion des ressources naturelles. 

Les participants ont été repartis en groupes et ont pu discuter des causes et conséquences des conflits intercommunautaires, proposer des moyens de prévention et de gestion de ces conflits. D’enrichissantes recommandations ont été formulées lors des séances de restitution.  

Dans son mot de clôture, le Secrétaire General de la Région de l’Ennedi Est a invité les participants au forum à être des acteurs de coexistence pacifique, mettant en œuvre toutes les recommandations formulées lors du forum. Il a rappelé que la question de la cohabitation pacifique est une « priorité du pays de Toumai, qui a décidé de faire du 28 novembre, jour de la proclamation de la République du Tchad, la journée de prière et de cohabitation pacifique.  

La région de l’Ennedi Est, dans le nord-est du Tchad, abrite le camp de réfugiés d’Ouré Cassoni qui accueillent plus de 29.160 Soudanais dans un environnement aride où la rivalité pour les maigres ressources naturelles peut conduire à des tensions entre les communautés.  

Pour renforcer la cohabitation entre ces réfugiés et les populations tchadiennes qui les ont généreusement accueillis, depuis plus d’une décennie, le HCR finance la construction ou l’amélioration et l’équipement d’infrastructure sociocommunautaires comme des centres de santé, des écoles, des points d’eau.",268,"French"

- Après suspension suite aux menaces des éléments armés, la distribution des vivres aux PDIs à Bria a repris cette semaine

- Tentatives croissantes d’un groupe armé de régenter, sans partage, la ville de Kouango.

**CONTEXTES SECURITAIRE ET HUMANITAIRE**

**Préfecture de la Haute Kotto**

- Poursuite des combats sur l’axe Bria - Ippy entre groupes armés, S/P Bria Nouveau clash entre groupes armés le 28 Novembre entre PK07 et PK18 sur l’axe Bria-Ippy. Plusieurs maisons auraient été incendiées alors que le centre de santé communautaire de Ngoubi, situé au 18 Km, aurait été vandalisé lors de ces accrochages entre hommes armés, selon des sources locales. Aucun bilan humain n’est disponible pour l’instant. A l’approche du début du juteux trafic des camions commerciaux en provenance du Soudan pour l’achat du café, le contrôle des check points pour la collecte des taxes serait au centre des enjeux de ce nouvel épisode des combats sur cet axe. Malheureusement, les populations civiles en font les frais, au regard du déplacement forcé des habitants de cet axe vers le site du PK03 dans la ville de Bria.  

**Préfecture de la Basse-Kotto**

- Tentative d’enlèvement des civils par des hommes armés à Dimbi, S/P Gambo.  
Des sources locales rapportent de l’enlèvement de 22 personnes par des hommes armés le 02 Décembre dans les localités périphériques de Dimbi, 17 km à l’ouest de Kembé. En patrouille dans la zone, les éléments de la Force de la MINUSCA auraient réussi à faire libérer les victimes. Le même phénomène touche la localité voisine de Kembé où, selon un décompte effectué par les autorités locales, environ 100 personnes ont été enlevées par des hommes armés dans les périphéries de Kembé au cours des deux à trois derniers mois. Une fois enlevées, le sort des victimes n’est invariablement jamais connu par après. Ce qui est assez inquiétant.  

**Préfecture du Mbomou**

- Importants dégâts matériels et humains rapportés à Dembia suite aux combats, S/P Rafai Selon certains leaders communautaires qui ont effectué une évaluation globale des conséquences des récents combats à Dembia, 75% des maisons de la localité auraient été incendiées, la quasi-totalité de la population a fui vers Rafaï notamment ; et en termes de bilan humain selon la même source, un total de 66 victimes a été enregistré, 34 parmi les civils et 32 parmi les combattants.",268,"French"

**Préfecture de la Haute Kotto**

- Mort d’un élément FPU Mauritanien dans les accrochages entre un GA et la MINUSCA à Bria, S/P Bria Après une longue absence de Bria, le récent retour du leader des éléments du groupe dit d’autodéfense se trouvant sur le site de PK03 a fortement contribué non seulement à plusieurs incidents sécuritaires sur ledit site mais a aussi exacerbé l’hostilité des éléments de son groupe contre la MINUSCA. Dans cet ordre, un violent accrochage a eu lieu entre les troupes de la MINUSCA et les AD en date du 04 Décembre 2017 dans la périphérie du site de déplacés de PK03 à Bria. Un tué et 03 blessés ont été enregistrés du côté de la FPU Mauritanienne, contre environ 11 tués et 04 blessés du côté des AD ; en plus de 2 civils qui auraient aussi été blessés. Accompagné du Commandant de la Force MINUSCA, le ministre de l’intérieur a visité Bria le 05-12-2017 pour rencontrer différents protagonistes de la crise.  
Sous l’impulsion de Monsieur Bokassa, les AB ont décliné l’invitation de rencontrer le ministre.

- Arrivée et installation du nouveau Préfet de la Haute Kotto à Bria, S/P Bria Le nouveau Préfet de la Haite Kotto a été présenté à la population dans une cérémonie tenue à Bria le 07 Décembre 2017 au bureau de la Préfecture qui était resté longtemps non-fonctionnel. Le préfet était accompagné des souspréfets de Bria et de Yalinga. Le préfet et sous-préfet de Bria ont rappelé à la population qu’ils sont venus travailler avec toutes les communautés et tous les acteurs sans distinction. Cette arrivée aiderait à avoir un interlocuteur étatique pour discuter des questions humanitaires de l’ensemble de la préfecture, mais plus urgemment des entraves, de plus en plus récurrentes, des actions humanitaires sur le site des PDIs du PK03 par des hommes armés qui y ont élu domicile. Le dernier en date (semaine passée) étant l’interdiction par ces derniers d’un véhicule de location utilisé par une ONG d’accéder sur ledit site si la taxe imposée à cet effet n’est pas payée par le propriétaire du camion. 

**Préfecture de la Ouaka**

- Incursion des éléments d’un GA à Bolo causant un déplacement massif des populations, S/P Kouango.  
Exode massif des populations de l’axe Ngadza-Ndoro (nombre inconnu) rapporté le 05 décembre par des sources locales, conséquence d’une incursion des éléments d’un groupe armé au village Bolo, 40 Km au Nord de Kouangoville sur l’axe Lihoto. Le bilan initial fait état d’une personne blessée par balle, déjà transférée à l’hôpital de Kouango pour prise en charge médicale. Les renforts envoyés par ce groupe armé depuis Kouango auraient davantage contribué à la poursuite de ce mouvement des populations dans la brousse et vers les villages voisins.

- Poursuite des affrontements entre groupes armés à Ippy, S/P Ippy Débutés depuis le 03 décembre, les combats dans la ville de Ippy entre les éléments des groupes armés rivaux se seraient poursuis jusqu’au 07 décembre. Le bilan humain serait très lourd, y compris parmi les civils. Les conséquences humanitaires y découlant seraient aussi très importantes, y compris le déplacement massif des populations à l’intérieur de la ville d’Ippy sur trois sites : Eglise catholique, Eglise CEBI, et PK05 axe Bambari ; ainsi que vers d’autres localités environnantes, notamment à Maloum où plus de 8 000 déplacés seraient déjà arrivés. Il n’y a pas pour l’instant des données disponibles relatives au nombre des déplacés internes à l’intérieur de la ville, ni de l’ampleur de leurs besoins immédiats. L’onde de choc des affrontements à Ippy n’a pu qu’être faiblement ressentie à Bambari jusque-là, principalement avec la des commerces dans les quartiers Bornou et Hadji intervenue le 7 Décembre 2017.

- Une organisation humanitaire interdite d’accès à Pombolo par un GA, S/P Gambo.  
En mission d’intervention médicale d’urgence à Pombolo, une équipe de l’ONGI IOC s’est vue bloquée à la sortie Ouest de la localité de Gambo par des hommes armés, l’empêchant de poursuivre son chemin jusqu’à Pombolo. Sans brutalité mais fermes dans leur interdiction, ces hommes ont expliqué à l’équipe médicale de l’ONGI qui soutient déjà le centre de santé de Gambo que son action ne devrait pas s’étendre jusqu’à Pombolo. L’évocation des principes humanitaires, dont la neutralité par l’ONGI n’a pas réussi à fléchir la position des hommes armés en question. L’incident s’est produit 08 Décembre et l’ONGI n’avait pas d’autre choix que de rebrousser chemin.",268,"French"
2373134,"Mali: Aperçu des besoins humanitaires 2018 (novembre 2017) BESOINS HUMANITAIRES

ET CHIFFRES CLÉS

Le contexte humanitaire reste préoccupant suite à une conjoncture sécuritaire dégradée dans les régions du nord et du centre du pays où le banditisme, les conflits intercommunautaires et la présence de groupes armés et d'extrémistes sont toujours signalés représentant ainsi une menace pour la sécurité des populations. L'insécurité sur les principaux axes routiers entrave la circulation des personnes et des biens, l'accès des populations aux services sociaux de base, ainsi que l'accès des humanitaires aux populations vulnérables. Au total, il est estimé que 4 095 000 personnes auront besoin d'une ou plusieurs formes d'assistance humanitaire en 2018 contre 3,7 millions en 2017.  
En outre, le Mali est sujet au changement climatique et à de fréquents épisodes de catastrophes naturelles, y compris sécheresse et inondations. Sur l'ensemble du territoire, ce sont 60 000 personnes qui sont à risque d'inondations. Selon l'Index de risque INFORM1, les régions de Kidal, Gao, Tombouctou, Mopti et Ségou seraient fortement menacées en 2018, avec des indices par région allant de 6 à 6,9 sur 10. Ces régions sont extrêmement vulnérables en termes de capacité d'adaptation et d'exposition aux dangers. Le Mali est classé 175ème pays sur 188 au classement mondial de l'Indice de Développement Humain avec une pauvreté chronique sérieuse rendant vulnérable une bonne partie de la population. Cette vulnérabilité est exacerbée dans certaines régions par la difficulté rencontrée autour de l'installation des autorités intérimaires, la mise en place des Mécanismes Opérationnels de Coordination (MOC) et le processus de Désarmement, Démobilisation et Réintégration (DDR), entre autres gages prévus dans l'accord de paix. Depuis lors, seul 35% de l'administration et des services sociaux de base auraient été redéployés dans les zones affectées. Cette faible présence de l'Etat dans les cinq régions au nord et au centre du pays est un autre élément clé de la fragilité de ces zones. 

**BESOINS HUMANITAIRES**

**Sécurité Alimentaire**

L'insécurité alimentaire touchera plus de 22%1 de la population malienne en 2018 (contre 19% en 2017), soit 4,1 millions de personnes en phase 2 et au-delà. Cela représente une hausse notamment pour les phases de crise et d'urgence2 , avec près de 800 000 personnes (contre 600 000 en 2017), dont la moitié sont des femmes ayant un besoin urgent d'assistance alimentaire et agricole durant la période de soudure 2018. 

Au cours du premier semestre 2017, la soudure pastorale a été particulièrement difficile pour les populations d'éleveurs et de pasteurs. 

Le tarissement précoce des points d'eau et l'insuffisance des stocks de fourrage disponibles ont affecté significativement le cheptel, en qualité et en quantité. La chute des termes de l'échange bétail/céréales a fortement affecté les moyens d'existence des populations dépendantes de l'élevage. L'existence d'inégalités structurelles profondes dans les relations entre femmes et hommes signifient aussi que l'insécurité alimentaire frappe différemment les membres d'un même foyer. Lorsque l'alimentation n'est pas disponible en quantité suffisante, il n'est pas rare que les femmes et les filles mangent moins, ou moins souvent, afin de privilégier les autres membres de leurs familles. Les personnes âgées et handicapées ainsi que les femmes chef de ménage sont les plus vulnérables à l'insécurité alimentaire.

**Santé/Nutrition**

Selon les résultats de l'enquête nutritionnelle SMART de 2017, le taux de Malnutrition Aigüe Globale (MAG) est de 10,7% (comme en 2016) et celui de Malnutrition Aigüe Sévère (MAS) de 2,6% (contre 2,1% en 2016). Ces chiffres sont au-delà du seuil d'alerte fixé par l'OMS supérieur ou égal à 10% pour la MAG et supérieur ou égal à 2% pour la MAS. 

Exacerbée par l'insécurité alimentaire, l'accès inadéquat aux services de santé et à l'eau, l'hygiène et l'assainissement(EHA), la malnutrition est un problème majeur de santé publique. Le rapport SMART 2017 révèle ainsi que le taux de MAG est de 15,7% à Tombouctou et 15,2% à Gao, dépassant le seuil d'urgence des 15% fixé par l'OMS. Au total, ce sont 753 000 enfants âgés de 6 à 59 mois et 115 000 femmes enceintes et allaitantes qui seront vulnérables à la malnutrition en 2018. On estime à 1,7 millions le nombre de personnes vulnérables ayant des besoins sanitaires urgents dont 936 850 enfants âgés de 5 à 17 ans. Les personnes âgées vivant seules restent elles aussi très vulnérables.

**Protection**

Au 30 septembre 2017, sur une population totale de 18,9 millions, près de 59 000 sont encore déplacées à l'intérieur du Mali (contre 37 000 au 31/12/2016) dont 30 000 nouvellement déplacées. 498 000 personnes sont considérées comme retournées (contre 474 230 au 31/12/2016) et plus de 61 000 personnes ont été rapatriées des pays voisins. Malgré les nouveaux déplacements transfrontaliers continus, 142 386 réfugiés maliens résident encore dans les pays limitrophes (Mauritanie, Niger et Burkina Faso).  

Plus de 650 incidents de protection ont été enregistrés parmi lesquels des cas de viols et autres formes de violences basées sur le genre (VBG), des atteintes au droit à la vie, au droit à l'intégrité physique mais aussi des arrestations arbitraires, des cas de torture et autres traitements inhumains et dégradants. L'écart en termes de prévention et réponse aux VBG et autres violations des droits de l'Homme est critique, et l'accès à des structures de prise en charge de qualité est encore très faible. Concernant le suivi des violations des droits des enfants, 361 cas de violations graves ont été enregistrés dans le cadre du Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) de janvier à juin 2017 et des milliers d'enfants restent privés du droit d'accès à l'éducation en raison de la crise. Sur ces 361 cas, 191 cas de recrutements par les groupes armés ont été rapportés. La condition des filles, des femmes et des jeunes exposés aux fréquents cas de violences sexuelles et d'enrôlement par les groupes armés demeure aussi préoccupante.",268,"French"
2373104,"Gao : Une agriculture vivante, commerciale et pérenne est indispensable au développement de la région Une forte délégation de la MINUSMA s’est rendue, le 6 décembre 2017, dans la commune rurale d’Anchawadj (à 45 km au nord-est de la ville de Gao), pour inaugurer un projet à impact rapide (QIP) intitulé "" Installation d’un périmètre maraîcher de 2 Ha pour la jeunesse de Djebock"". Prévu pour durer six mois il est financé pour un montant de 29.021.280 FCFA. Mis en œuvre par l’Association ""Algafiet"", ce projet vise à créer des opportunités d’emplois pour les jeunes qui sont susceptibles d’être enrôlés dans des groupes armés.

Mohamed Ag Mohamed Maouloud, marié avec 3 enfants est un berger qui s’est joint à l’Association ""Algafiet"" il y a un peu plus de six mois. Il y a appris l’agriculture. « Depuis mon enfance, tout ce que je savais faire c’était de conduire les troupeaux aux pâturages à des kilomètres de chez nous. Travailler la terre n’est pas dans nos habitudes », déclare-t-il avant d’ajouter que : « depuis six mois, je travaille la terre et notre maison ne manque plus de légumes et autres betteraves. Mais avant, nous mourrions de faim régulièrement. Vous avez les vaches et les moutons, mais il faut trouver des acheteurs pour avoir un peu d’argent et ce n’est pas du tout facile ».

Le projet à impact rapide financé par la MINUSMA vient de transformer la vie et le comportement de plusieurs jeunes de la localité de Djebock, située dans la commune rurale d’Anchawadji. Ils y cultivent les carottes, les pommes de terre, les betteraves rouges, les céleris, les choux, les oignons et échalotes, les courges, les tomates et voire même, les arachides. 

M. Mohamed Haidara, conseiller communal qui représentait le Maire d’Anchawadj à la cérémonie d’inauguration dudit projet, se réjouit de l’initiative prise par les jeunes de sa localité qui sont appuyés par une assistance technique de l’ONG-Union pour un Avenir Écologique et Solidaire (UAVES). « Aucun additif chimique, pesticide ou engrais ne sera utilisé dans ce périmètre maraîcher de 2 ha, grâce à notre expertise en matière agro-écologique, » a pour sa part, rassuré M. Adama Tiégoum, coordinateur de l’ONG-UAVES, qui encourage les membres de l’association à pratiquer une agriculture écologique. 

La commune d’Anchawadj est une commune de migration par excellence où, la population effectue une transhumance saisonnière à la recherche des pâturages et des points d’eau. La présence de mares temporaires notamment Djebock, Agdilinta, Samit et Imnas, servant de zone de repli pour le cheptel pendant la saison sèche, n’arrive pas à satisfaire les besoins en eau, tant pour les animaux que pour les populations.

« Une agriculture vivante, commerciale et pérenne est indispensable au développement de notre région, qui représente pour nous un immense intérêt commun, » a souligné le Représentant du Maire d’Anchawadj, tout en poursuivant : « comme l’eau salubre est indispensable à la vie et à la santé, son accès est importants pour le bien-être de la société ».

Ce projet à impact rapide a aussi facilité non seulement la réalisation d’un château d’eau permettant la distribution de l’eau dans les bassins à l’intérieur du périmètre, mais également la construction de bassins et du système d’irrigation qui facilite l’apport de l’eau dans les planches. C’est d’ailleurs « l’une des grandes réussites de ce projet qui vient de mettre l’eau potable à la disposition des animaux et des populations, afin de prévenir les risques de santé publique liés aux maladies transmises par l’eau, » a reconnu le Coordinateur de l’ONG-UAVES.

Crée en juillet 2015 et composée de 63 membres dont 28 femmes, l’Association ""Algafiet"" a pour objectifs de lutter contre la pauvreté, l’analphabétisme et de promouvoir le reboisement dans la zone. Elle cible les jeunes et les femmes qui sont les plus exposés aux catastrophes et aux effets néfastes du conflit armé dans la région.",268,"French"

2373034,"Cluster Nutrition République Centrafricaine: Analyse de la situation nutritionnelle au 1er trimestre 2016 **1. La situation en matière de nutrition et d’insécurité alimentaire**

L’analyse sectorielle de la nutrition sur la base des résultats de l’enquête SMART 2014 révèle une situation nutritionnelle préoccupante sur l’ensemble de la RCA. Ces résultats montrent une prévalence de la malnutrition aiguë globale (6,6%) et sévère (1,9%), avec un taux de mortalité très alarmant chez les enfants de moins de cinq ans dépassant 2,02 décès / pour 10,000 naissances vivantes / par jour, en particulier dans la Nana Gribizi (3,34 décès / 10 000/ jour), l'Ouham (3,41 décès / 10 000 / jour) et Kemo (2,29). 0,4% des malnutris aiguë sévères présentent des œdèmes nutritionnels, la forme marasmique restant prédominante à 1,4%.  

Le taux de la malnutrition chronique est à 40,8%. Ce taux dépasse les 50% dans les préfectures de la Mamberé-Kadei (50,3%) et Sangha Mbaere (53%). 
 
En revanche, l’enquête nutritionnelle réalisée en 2015 dans les sites de déplacés et enclaves en RCA révèle une situation non alarmante du statut nutritionnel des populations vivant dans ses entités. Seuls les sites de Boda dans la préfecture d’Ombella-Mpoko font exception tant pour la malnutrition aiguë globale (9,2%) et sévère (2,2%) que pour la malnutrition chronique (47,2%) et pour l’insuffisance pondérale (26,6%) en présentant une situation qui s’inscrit dans l’urgence par rapport aux seuils de l’OMS. Quant à la mortalité rétrospective, la situation reste dans le seuil d’alerte par rapport aux normes OMS.  

En outre, l’enquête nutritionnelle réalisée en 2016 dans la commune de Grivai-Pamia, Sous-préfecture de Kaga-Bandoro montre une situation nutritionnelle pas particulièrement préoccupante (MAG : 5,8% ; MAS : 1,5% ; Malnutrition chronique : 49.8%). Par contre, celle réalisée dans la commune de Bakou, Sous-préfecture d’Alindao montre une situation nutritionnelle alarmante (MAG : 10,8% ; MAS : 2,8% ; Malnutrition chronique : 41.1%)  

L'insécurité alimentaire est devenue un problème majeur en RCA, en particulier depuis la crise aiguë de l'année 2013 en raison de la production insuffisante, du déplacement de la population agricole, l'impact du changement climatique sur la production alimentaire dans le nord-est et les prix élevés des denrées alimentaires à Bangui et ses environs.  

Selon l’enquête IPC réalisée en Dec-2015, de nombreuses zones sont classifiées au niveau d'insécurité alimentaire phase III, qui peut potentiellement se traduire par l'insécurité alimentaire aigues et des crises de moyens de subsistance. Ceci est confirmé par la dernière enquête EFSA menée par la FAO/PAM qui montrent qu’en RCA, environ la moitié de la population (50,5%) est en insécurité alimentaire. 15,2% de la population est en insécurité alimentaire sévère et 35,3% en insécurité alimentaire modérée. Cette situation varie fortement selon les préfectures. Elle est très élevée (supérieure à 60 pour cent des ménages) dans les préfectures de Nana-Mambéré (77%), Haut-Mbomou (74,5%), Mambéré-Kadéï (73,2%), Ouham (68,6%), Vakaga (64%) et Nana-Gribizi (61,4%).",268,"French"
2372919,"Gao - 16 jours d’activisme contre les violences faites aux femmes et aux filles Quelques heures après la célébration à Bamako de la Journée internationale des droits de l’homme, hier 12 décembre, revenons sur l’un des temps forts de la campagne des 16 jours d’activisme qui, à Gao, a été lancée le 29 novembre dernier. En effet, tous les 25 novembre, le coup d’envoi de la Campagne des 16 jours d’activisme est donné à travers le monde. Elle représente également le démarrage de la série de journées internationales qui ont lieu en décembre, en faveur de la protection des personnes handicapées le 3, ou encore, celle des droits de l’homme le 10.  

« Toute forme d’exploitation sexuelle des femmes et des fillettes offense la dignité de la personne humaine et celle de la femme, » a souligné Mme Ndeye Yande Kane, Cheffe du bureau régional de la Division des Droits de l’Homme de la Protection (DDHP) de la MINUSMA. Elle s’adressait aux participants, en majorité des femmes, venues assister au lancement de la Campagne dite des ""16 jours d’activisme contre les violences faites aux femmes et les filles"", qui s’achève le 10 décembre, Journée Internationale des Droits de l’Homme.

La dignité et la valeur de la personne humaine étaient au centre de l'attention des participants qui ont suivi et applaudi les différents intervenants, notamment M. Oumar Touré, Coordinateur de la clinique juridique DEMESO, M. Sékou Traoré, Chef du sous-bureau ONU Femmes, Mlle Saima Mahamane Maiga, Vice-présidente du Parlement des Enfants de la région de Gao, M. Alassane Touré, représentant du Groupe de Recherche, d’Étude, de Formation Femme Action (GREFFA), Dumisani Hanyani de la Déontologie et Discipline de la Mission onusienne, et Mme Fatoumata Tiegoun Maiga, présidente de l’Association des victimes de la crise.

Mme Ndeye Yande Kane a rappelé le principe de tolérance zéro envers l’exploitation et des abus sexuels. Une règle qui doit être appliquée, observée et respectée par tous les fonctionnaires des Nations Unies. Elle a ensuite encouragé les femmes à dénoncer et à barrer la route à l’inconduite sexuelle, d’où qu’elle vienne, surtout quand celle-ci implique les fonctionnaires de la Mission onusienne. Son intervention a provoqué une salve d'applaudissements montrant clairement l’intérêt que porte la MINUSMA au problème grave que constitue l’exploitation sexuelle dans cette région où, des cas de maltraitance, d’abus et d’exploitation sexuels et autres violations des droits humains, même après les heures les plus sombres de la crises, sont encore dénombrés.

L’évènement a aussi offert une véritable plateforme de communication aux enfants qui ont interpellé, dans une déclaration du Parlement des enfants de Gao, les participants. Ils les ont exhorté à donner leur ""oui"" inconditionnel et irrévocable à la politique de tolérance zéro à l’égard de la violence faite aux femmes, aux filles et aux enfants. « Face à la gravité de la situation, Nous, Enfants parlementaires de la région de Gao disons ""NON"" à la violence faite aux femmes, aux filles et aux enfants, » a conclu sa vice-présidente, Mlle Saima Mahamane Maiga, après avoir donné lecture dudit message.

Les chefs traditionnels de quartiers ont favorablement accueilli ce rappel de vigilance sur la prévention et la protection contre ces violences, et ont tous accepté de collaborer avec la Mission onusienne pour prévenir et protéger les victimes.

L’artiste-musicien Sabane Boubacar Touré (SBT) et son groupe Souba Gomno, ont donné un spectacle qui visait à délivrer des messages clés sur la paix et la réconciliation, mais également sur le thème de la campagne 2017, à savoir "" De la paix à la maison à la paix dans le monde : une éducation sûre pour tous"".",268,"French"
2372779,"RDC: 22 réfugiés centrafricains d’une même famille accueillis par un jeune Congolais à Mobayi-Mbongo Gbadolite, le 13 décembre 2017 (caritasdev.cd) : La conjoncture économique difficile et la solidarité africaine poussent souvent des parents à vivre dans une même parcelle avec leurs enfants et petits-fils. C’est ce qui est arrivé à Madame Ange-Marie NYAKONYADE. Commerçante de son état, cette quinquagénaire vivait paisiblement avec son mari, un pêcheur septuagénaire, et leurs enfants, neveux et petits-fils, dans la localité MUNE, Groupement Somba, en République Centrafricaine (RCA). Leur « petite » famille comptait ainsi 35 personnes. Tous Centrafricains.
 

Mme Ange-Marie excellait dans la vente du poisson. Elle traversait la rivière Ubangi, qui sépare son pays de la République Démocratique du Congo (RDC), particulièrement du Territoire de Mobayi-Mbongo, pour acheter du poisson qu’elle revendait en RCA.

Elle arrivait ainsi avec son mari à satisfaire les besoins fondamentaux de leur famille ; jusqu’au 16 mai 2017, lorsque les affrontements meurtriers entre les miliciens Seleka (d’obédience musulmane) et Anti-Balaka (de tendance chrétienne) les ont obligés à fuir en désordre vers Mobayi-Mbongo en RDC. Il n’était pas facile de réussir pareille opération pour une si grande famille. Mme Ange-Marie et son mari ont dû faire deux navettes avec une pirogue pour faire traverser tous leurs 33 dépendants en RDC.

**B. Kokanda saisi de compassion sur la rive congolaise**
 
De la rive congolaise à Mobayi-Mbongo, on pouvait entendre ce mardi-là des crépitements des balles de l’autre côté de la rivière. Les Congolais voyaient alors les réfugiés centrafricains, affolés, débarquer sur leur rive. Mr Gboku Kokanda était parmi eux.
Habituée à traverser à Mobayi-Mbongo, Mme Ange-Marie s’était enfoncée dans le quartier riverain avec quelques enfants avant de revenir au rivage. Elle réussit ainsi à loger 13 enfants dans trois familles congolaises.

Mais, elle-même, son mari et 20 autres enfants se sont retrouvés sur la plage, ne sachant où aller, sous une pluie battante. C’est là que Gboku Kokanda est entré en jeu. Agé de 28 ans, fils du chef de Groupement, ce pêcheur congolais est marié et père de quatre enfants. Il a vu Mme Ange-Marie se couper en quatre pour mettre ses enfants, déjà traumatisés par la guerre qui les a chassés de leur maison en RCA, à l’abri de la pluie. A part elle et son mari, il y avait 8 filles et 12 garçons. Il a eu pitié d’eux. « Je vais tous les emmener chez moi, même si nous devrions après dormir comme des cochons », se dit-il.
La maison de Gboku Kokanda compte quatre chambres. Lorsqu’il installa ses hôtes, il n’y avait plus de place pour lui, sa femme et ses enfants. Dans son élan de solidarité, il a dû alors leur laisser toute la maison pour aller vivre provisoirement chez son père.

**Survie difficile pour ces réfugiés**
 
Il était dès lors difficile pour Mme Ange-Marie de subvenir aux besoins fondamentaux de sa grande famille, a-t-elle confiée à caritasdev.cd, sous la traduction de Mme Mbuanga Ziambi Mado, Référente de la paroisse Saint Michel de Mobayi-Mbongo du Programme « Veille Humanitaire », piloté par Caritas International Belgique, pour le compte  de la Caritas-Développement Molegbe. « Au début, je traversais et allais dans notre marché du côté de la RCA. Mais, la détérioration des conditions sécuritaires ne le permet plus depuis août dernier. Les miliciens Seleka et Anti-Balaka sont dans les parages. Le petit fonds que nous avons amené de la RCA est épuisé. Du coup, nous vivotons ici », a relevé la réfugiée.

« Pour manger, il faut espérer que l’enfant qui nous a accueillis attrape du poisson, qu’il nous le donne et que nous vendions, pour acheter des feuilles de manioc », a-t-elle poursuivi.

Que dire alors de l’éducation des enfants et des soins médicaux ? « Les enfants, surtout ceux du Cycle secondaire, ont difficile à étudier. Il leur faut des fournitures et frais scolaires. Voilà pourquoi deux enfants n’étudient pas », a regretté la Centrafricaine. Quant aux soins médicaux, ils ne sont pas assurés à la mesure des besoins. Mme Ange-Marie était elle-même couverte d’un gros pull-over, au moment de l’entretien ; car, depuis trois jours, elle faisait une fièvre sans possibilité de se faire soigner… 

**Besoin d’au moins 300 dollars Us pour démarrer un petit commerce**

Face à cette misère, Mme Ange-Marie lance un cri de cœur aux personnes de bonne foi pour lui trouver au moins une somme de 300 dollars américains pour démarrer un petit commerce. Elle pourrait faire la route et aller chercher des marchandises vers Kotakoli (à 75 km) et rentrer les vendre à Mobayi-Mbongo. Elle pourrait aussi, avec moins que cela, débuter à vendre des beignets sur place. (Les bonnes volontés peuvent l’atteindre à travers le Chargé de Communication de la Caritas Congo Asbl au +243 998 45 60 39, communication@caritasdev.cd ).

**Le Programme Veille Humanitaire en actions**

Pour rappel, face à l’afflux des réfugiés centrafricains dans les Diocèse de Molgebe, Caritas International Belgique (CIbe) a intensifié son Programme de veille Humanitaire dans cette partie de la RDC. Caritas-Développement Molegbe, la Croix-Rouge sous la houlette de la Caritas Provinciale de Mbandaka, a organisé récemment une mission d’accompagnement et de renforcement des capacités des Référents CPC de 5 Paroisses  ainsi que des volontaires de la Croix-Rouge sur l’axe Gbadolite-Yakoma, où se retrouvent les réfugiés centrafricains.

Cette mission a offert une belle opportunité à Caritas Congo Asbl de palper du doigt la situation des réfugiés centrafricains et collecter des informations pertinentes à partager avec l’ensemble de la Communauté humanitaire ainsi que toute la Confédération de Caritas Internationalis.

Voilà pourquoi un communiqué de presse a été publié le 11 novembre 2017, sous le titre : « Nord-Ubangi : pas assez d’aide pour les réfugies centrafricains ! ». Et ce témoignage de Mme Ange-Marie est une preuve du travail que réalisent ces Référents paroissiaux de « Veille Humanitaire. »

2372349,"Communiqué de Presse : Pour un accès universel aux services d'assainissement améliorés et la fin de la défécation à l'air libre à Djibouti Djibouti, le 13 Décembre 2017 – La Direction de l’Hydraulique Rurale du Ministère de l’Agriculture, de l’Eau, de l’Elevage, de la Pêche et des Ressources Halieutiques, a procédé ce jour à la validation du premier Plan Stratégique de l’Assainissement Individuel à Djibouti, avec l’appui de ses partenaires, dont l’USAID et l’UNICEF.

Ce plan vise à offrir un cadre opérationnel pour les autorités nationales et tous les acteurs du secteur en vue de faciliter et harmoniser la planification de l'assainissement individuel et de la promotion de l'hygiène en milieu rural, périurbain et urbain à Djibouti. Assorti d’un plan d’action à court, moyen et long terme, ce plan ambitionne de garantir l’accès universel, durable et abordable à des services d’assainissement améliorés et de mettre fin aux pratiques de la défécation à l’air libre. L’accent est mis sur l’assainissement individuel au niveau familial et communautaire.

""L’eau potable, un assainissement de base et de bonnes pratiques en matière d’hygiène constituent un ensemble et sont essentiels pour la survie et le développement des enfants. Ce plan visera à accélérer les efforts du Gouvernement dans ces domaines, en impliquant l’ensemble des acteurs"" a souligné Souad Souleimane Ahmed, Directrice de l’Hydraulique Rurale, à cette occasion.

""L’USAID a répondu avec engouement à l’appel du Ministère de l’Agriculture, de la Pêche, de l’Elevage et des Ressources Hydrauliques, pour l’appuyer à travers l’UNICEF dans l’élaboration du Plan Stratégique d’Assainissement Individuel qui est soumis aujourd’hui pour validation"" a pour sa part déclaré Rabihah Mateen, Représentante de l’USAID à Djibouti.

Djibouti compte parmi les pays ayant atteint les Objectifs du Millénaire pour le Développement en termes d’accès à l’eau potable. Ce n’est cependant pas le cas en matière d’accès aux services d’assainissement. La défécation à l’air libre est encore pratiquée à large échelle, particulièrement en milieu rural. Cette pratique est particulièrement dangereuse car le contact avec les excréments humains peut provoquer des maladies comme le choléra, la typhoïde, l’hépatite, la polio, la diarrhée, les infestations parasitaires intestinales (vers intestinaux) et la dénutrition. A Djibouti, environ un enfant sur 14 meurt avant l’âge de cinq ans pour des causes évitables.

""L'impact que peut avoir un assainissement propre et sûr est transformationnel. Les avantages économiques d'un assainissement amélioré peuvent augmenter la productivité, réduire les coûts des soins de santé et prévenir la maladie, l'invalidité et la mort prématurée. Les personnes qui ont accès à des services d’assainissement propres, sûres et pratiques connaissent également une plus grande dignité, intimité et sécurité. Ceci est particulièrement important pour les femmes et les filles"" a poursuivi Rabihah Mateen.

Ce nouveau plan stratégique s’articulera autour de trois axes spécifiques : (i) l’établissement des conditions cadre nécessaires à la mise en place du plan ; (ii) la génération de la demande des ménages pour des services d’assainissement améliorés ; et (iii) le développement de l’offre en quantité, en qualité et à des prix abordables pour répondre à la demande. Les rôles et les responsabilités des différents acteurs – y compris ceux du secteur privé – sont clairement définis dans ce plan stratégique.

""Un des plus grands défis n’est pas simplement celui de mettre en place des toilettes propres et sécurisées, mais de faire évoluer les comportements de communautés entières. L’UNICEF, grâce au soutien financier constant de l’USAID, accompagnera le Gouvernement pour la mise en œuvre de ce plan dans tous ses aspects"", a conclu Djanabou Mahondé, Représentante de l’UNICEF à Djibouti.

2372194,"Le nombre de familles séparées par un conflit, la violence ou une catastrophe naturelle a atteint un niveau record depuis cinq ans Le nombre de familles séparées par un conflit, une situation de violence ou une catastrophe naturelle n'a jamais été aussi élevé depuis cinq ans, selon les données recueillies par le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR). Entre 2012 et 2016, on a ainsi enregistré une hausse de presque 90 % des nouveaux cas de personnes ayant fait appel à l'institution pour les aider à retrouver leurs proches, et 18 000 nouveaux dossiers ont été ouverts pendant la seule année 2016.

Ce n'est toutefois que la partie émergée de l'iceberg, indique le CICR. En effet, la collecte de données précises étant insuffisante, le nombre de familles dispersées est sans doute nettement plus élevé. Cette mise en garde coïncide avec le lancement d'une nouvelle campagne de Noël de l'institution, qui se fait l'écho de la détresse engendrée par une séparation familiale dans une vidéo poignante de 1 minute et 31 secondes : [Le pire cauchemar de tous les parents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjCUIRot_lM&feature=youtu.be)

Reproduisant des images de vidéosurveillance, le film met en scène des parents dans des lieux familiers, tels que des magasins bondés ou un zoo. Il retranscrit le sentiment de panique de ces mères, pères ou grands-parents qui perdent un instant de vue leurs enfants ou petits-enfants, et montre leurs efforts désespérés pour les retrouver. Cet éloignement temporaire est mis en regard des années de séparation endurées par des milliers de familles à travers le monde. On voit aussi quelques scènes touchantes de réunifications facilitées par le CICR.

L'institution invite le public à partager la vidéo pour sensibiliser l'opinion et à faire un don pour soutenir l'action vitale qu'elle mène afin que les familles soient réunies en cette période particulière, mais aussi le reste de l'année.

« Perdre un enfant est le pire cauchemar de tout parent, mais pour les familles touchées par un conflit, la violence ou une catastrophe naturelle, cette douloureuse réalité peut se prolonger des années. Les conflits durent de plus en plus longtemps et le monde est aujourd'hui confronté aux plus importants déplacements de population depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale, des facteurs qui accroissent le risque de perdre le contact avec sa famille », explique Matt Clancy, porte-parole du CICR.

« Réunir les familles est un aspect aussi important de notre mission humanitaire que de fournir de l'eau, des vivres ou un abri. Il s'agit de rendre leur dignité à ces personnes et de rétablir le contact avec leurs proches. D'autant plus que le droit international reconnaît aux familles le droit d'être réunies dans les situations de conflit armé. »

Le CICR s'attache à lutter contre ce problème en facilitant les réunifications familiales. Depuis plus de 100 ans, en collaboration avec ses partenaires du Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, le CICR met tout en œuvre pour aider les membres de familles séparées à se retrouver. Les liens peuvent être rétablis par une lettre ou un coup de fil, ou les personnes être réunies pour de bon, comme dans la vidéo.

2372184,"Les femmes de l’Afrique de l’Ouest s’engagent à plus s’impliquer dans la prévention des conflits et la consolidation de la paix La Huitième Edition de la journée portes ouvertes sur la mise en œuvre des Résolutions 1325 (2000) et suivantes du Conseil de Sécurité des Nations Unies sur les femmes, la paix et la sécurité s’est tenue le 11 décembre 2017 décembre 2017 à Dakar. Elle a été co-présidée par Mme Priya Gajraj, Coordonnatrice Résidente du système des Nations Unies au Sénégal, qui représentait M. Mohamed Ibn Chambas, Représentant spécial du Secrétaire-général et Chef du Bureau des Nations Unies pour l’Afrique de l’Ouest et le Sahel (UNOWAS) et M. Awudu Ahmed Gumah, Responsable de la Planification, Recherche, Suivi et Evaluation du Centre de la Communauté Economique des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (CEDEAO) pour le Développement du Genre.

Cette journée portes ouvertes avait pour objectif d’engager les parties prenantes nationales des pays de la sous-région et les acteurs régionaux dans la mise en œuvre du plan d’action triennal (2017-2020) de la CEDEAO sur la Composante Femmes, Paix et Sécurité du Cadre de Prévention des Conflits de la CEDEAO (CPCC). Le plan d’action triennal adopté en février 2017, reflète le progrès réalisé par les pays de la sous-région dans la mise en œuvre des Résolutions 1325 (2000) et suivantes, notamment à travers une implication effective des femmes dans la prévention des conflits et l’édification de la paix en Afrique de l’Ouest.

En délivrant l’allocution de M. Ibn Chambas,  Mme Priya Gajraj a souligné que «la région est dominée par des urgences humanitaires et sécuritaires qui ne seront pas complètement résolues sans une implication efficace des femmes et des jeunes ».

De son côté, M. Gumah a insisté sur la nécessité d’avoir une approche holistique qui permet  de construire une base durable pour la paix et la sécurité en Afrique de l’Ouest et dans le Sahel. « On note depuis un certain temps une implication des femmes et des jeunes dans la criminalité  transfrontalière, le terrorisme et le radicalisme en Afrique de l’Ouest. La dimension genre dans l’analyse et l’identification de solutions sur les problématiques de paix et de sécurité s’impose, » a dit M. Gumah.

Rappelant l’importance grandissante du rôle des femmes et des jeunes,  Marie-Josée Kandanga, Conseillère Régionale de ONUFemmes sur les questions de paix, sécurité et action humanitaire a insisté sur la nécessité d’intensifier le plaidoyer pour l’accélération de la mise en œuvre de la résolution 1325 et les suivantes par les Etats et  le renforcement du leadership des femmes de la région dans la lutte contre l’extrémisme violent et l’alerte précoce.

Au regard de l’important rôle que jouent les femmes dans la prévention et le règlement des conflits et dans la consolidation de la paix, les participantes se sont engagées, à  l’issue de cette rencontre,  à s’investir pleinement dans la mise en œuvre de ce plan d’action régionale qui vise à maintenir et promouvoir la paix et la sécurité en Afrique de l’Ouest.

Les journées Portes-ouvertes annuelles ont été instituées depuis l’année 2010 par le Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies, pour engager un dialogue direct avec les femmes et les acteurs des différentes régions du monde, afin de faire le point sur la mise en œuvre des résolutions 1325 et suivantes du Conseil de Sécurité des Nations Unies sur les femmes, la paix et la sécurité.

Cette Huitième Edition de la journée portes-ouvertes a été organisée par UNOWAS, la CEDEAO et ONUFEMMES en partenariat avec le Programme des Nations Unies pour le Développement (PNUD), le Fonds des Nations Unies pour la Population (UNFPA), le Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les Droits de l’Homme (HCDH), le G5 Sahel et l’Union du Fleuve Mano.",268,"French"
2372179,"Kwango : les fidèles de la paroisse de Mwense Anuarite sensibilisés à l’usage d’une bonne latrine Kenge, le 12 décembre 2017 (caritasdev.cd) : A l’ occasion de la Journée Mondiale de la toilette, les fidèles de la paroisse de Mwense Anuarite à Kenge, dans la Province de Kwango en RDC, ont été sensibilisés sur l’importance de l'utilisation de la toilette hygiénique. Dans un entretien accordé à caritasdev.cd mercredi 29 novembre 2017, la Sœur Delphine Nkufi, Chargée de projet à la Caritas Kenge, a parlé de cette activité, visant l’amélioration de l’assainissement et du bien-être de la population. En sa qualité d’oratrice, elle a invité ses interlocuteurs, et à travers eux toute la population de Kenge, à éviter la propagation des maladies mortelles par les excréments humains. D’où, l’importance des toilettes ; car, elles sauvent de vies.
 
En fait, chaque 19 novembre le monde entier célèbre la journée mondiale de la  toilette ou latrine. Et comme cette journée est tombée pour cette année un dimanche, elle a été une occasion pour la sœur Delphine Nkufi de s’adresser directement aux fidèles de sa paroisse.  Dans son exposé, la religieuse a plus mis l’accent sur les cinq moments critiques de lavage des mains pour éviter la transmission fécale et toutes les maladies liées aux mains sales, telles que le choléra, la dysenterie et la fièvre typhoïde.
En parlant de cinq moments critique, elle a cité : après avoir été à la toilette, après le changement de couche de l’enfant, avant de préparer ou de toucher les aliments, avant de manger ou de faire manger et après le manger, enfin  avant d’allaiter un enfant. Sr Delphine a exhorté les paroissiens de mettre en application ces cinq moments en vue d’éviter toutes les maladies liées aux mains sales, après avoir été à la toilette. Pour laver les mains, il faut utiliser le savon ou de la cendre sur les paumes des mains, a-t-elle expliqué à l’assistance.

La sœur Delpline  a également expliqué comment il faut entretenir une toilette hygiénique. Elle a dit qu’il ne  faudrait jamais laisser dans un récipient d’eau stagnante. L’eau doit toujours couler. « Par rapport à la latrine hygiénique, nous avions insisté sur les caractéristiques d’une latrine hygiénique.  Celle-ci doit être sans odeur, sans mouches ou de matières fécales sur la dalle ».

Sr Delphine a ainsi recommandé aux fidèles de toujours garder les murs et la dalle de la latrine propre à chaque utilisation. Il faut aussi verser une poignée de cendre dans le trou. La  pratique simple à faire pour entretenir  une toilette est de laver la latrine avec un ballet dur, sans pourtant verser de l’eau dans le trou de la latrine, a ajouté la sœur Delphine.

Il sied de souligner que  cette sensibilisation ne s’est pas limitée uniquement à la paroisse de Mwense Anaurite. Elle s’est étendue à d’autres paroisses, grâce à la facilitation des animateurs communautaires. Les fidèles ont été contents de recevoir ce message et se sont dit prêts à appliquer ces méthodes en vue d’éviter les maladies liées aux mains sales.

2372174,"La 1ere année du Plan de relèvement et de consolidation de la Paix en RCA passée en revue L’Assemblée nationale a servi de cadre, le mardi 12 décembre 2017,  à une cérémonie officielle commémorant le premier anniversaire du Plan national de relèvement et de consolidation de la paix (RCPCA) et du Cadre d’engagement mutuel (CEM) qui forment tous les deux un ensemble stratégique homogène, lancé officiellement le 17 novembre 2016 à Bruxelles.

Rehaussée par la présence du Président de la République, Faustin Archange Touadera, cette cérémonie a vu aussi la présence du Président de l’Assemblée nationale, Karim Meckassoua, du Premier ministre Simplice Sarandji, de plusieurs membres du gouvernement centrafricain, du Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies et chef de la MINUSCA, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, du Représentant de la Banque Mondiale,  Jean-Christophe Carret, de la cheffe d’Unité pour l’Afrique centrale de l’Union européenne, Francesca Di Mauro, et de plusieurs autres personnalités tant nationales qu’ étrangères.
 
En mai 2016, le Gouvernement de la RCA a sollicité l’appui de l’Union européenne, de l’Organisation des Nations Unies et du Groupe de la Banque mondiale pour réaliser l’Évaluation des besoins pour le relèvement et la consolidation de la paix.

L’évaluation a permis d’identifier les priorités pour les cinq premières années de la période post-électorale, avec trois objectifs précis : aider le Gouvernement de la RCA à identifier les besoins et les priorités en matière de relèvement et de consolidation de la paix, ainsi que les coûts associés ; 

identifier les modalités opérationnelles, institutionnelles et financières qui faciliteront la réalisation des priorités identifiées, compte tenu des contraintes relatives aux capacités et à la sécurité ; créer une plateforme permettant de suivre l’avancement de la mise en œuvre, notamment des grandes réformes engagées, et faire en sorte que toutes les activités de développement, humanitaires, politiques et de sécurité soient menées de façon cohérente.  Le rapport qui en découle a été approuvé par le Gouvernement en octobre 2016 et adopté en tant que Plan de relèvement et de consolidation de la paix.

Cette première revue permettra donc aux experts nationaux et internationaux de faire le point sur ce qui a été réalisé depuis Bruxelles. Mais aussi pour relever les défis rencontrés et pour s’accorder sur les axes prioritaires devant permettre de répondre plus efficacement aux attentes des populations.
Qualifiant la rencontre de « rendez-vous crucial pour le gouvernement et pour le peuple centrafricain », le Représentant résident de la Banque mondiale a souligné que « les attentes des populations sont de plus en plus fortes pour que  nous tenions dans les délais que nous nous sommes imposés »  quant à la  mise en route du plan. « La réussite de la RCPCA  est le passage obligé  pour le retour de la stabilité »  a-t-il  ajouté, réitérant « la détermination de la Banque mondiale à tenir ses engagements pris à Bruxelles »

La Cheffe de l’unité Afrique centrale de l’Union européenne en visite à  Bangui a,  pour sa part, rappelé que « cette revue  annuelle doit être l’occasion de faire le bilan des avancées  et au besoin celui des ajustements nécessaires. » Elle a, en outre, indiqué que l’Union européenne reste le premier donateur de développement en RCA  et «  le premier à tenir ses promesses »  depuis la rencontre de Bruxelles,  avec « plus de 50 millions d’euros injectés pour financer des actions de relèvement depuis le début de l’année 2017 ».

Le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, évoquant le RCPCA, a salué  « Un plan ambitieux, symbole de l’espoir de tous les centrafricains pour un développement équilibré de leur pays et de l’amélioration de leurs conditions de vie,  avant d’affirmer que : « des réformes ont été entreprises et des engagements importants ont été pris. Un certain nombre de projets concrets ont été réalisés. Leur impact commence à se faire sentir dans le vécu quotidien des centrafricains. » Et de faire valoir qu’ « il est indéniable que la crise centrafricaine est aussi et avant tout une crise aigüe de développement. Dans ce contexte, le RCPCA et le Cadre d’engagement mutuel sont porteurs d’une vision cohérente qui se propose d’apporter une réponse concrète au nexus sécurité, développement et aide humanitaire en RCA. » 

Le Président de la République centrafricaine s’est pour sa part félicité des avancées observées au cours de cette première année, notamment au niveau du Pilier 1, concernant la paix et la sécurité, même s’il reconnait  que « les premiers résultats restent en dessous des attentes légitimes de nos populations ». 

« Notre peuple a trop souffert et a besoin de vivre en paix ! », s’est en outre exclamé le Président centrafricain avant de faire une énumération « non exhaustive » des avancées observées pilier par pilier depuis le début de l’année 2017. Puis il a déploré « les capacités limitées de mise en œuvre des projets »,  et le fait que l’essentiel des projets soit établi par les Nations Unies et non par les experts des cabinets ministériels, déplorant au passage des insuffisances locales,  préjudiciables à la réussite complète du Plan.

Il est revenu, au terme de la cérémonie, au ministre de l’Economie, du Plan et de la Coopération de remettre un exemplaire du rapport de cette première année de mise en œuvre, au Président de la République,  au Président de l’Assemblée nationale  et au Premier ministre.",268,"French"
2372169,"Gao : La lutte contre l’impunité au cœur de la célébration de la journée internationale des droits de l’homme La division des droits de l’Homme et de la Protection de la MINUSMA a organisé à Gao, ce lundi 11 décembre 2017, la célébration de la 70e journée internationale des droits de l’Homme. C’était en présence des associations de victimes, des organisations des droits de l’homme, des représentants régionaux de l’administration judiciaire, et de la Commission Vérité, Justice et Réconciliation.

Cette célébration de la journée internationale des droits de l’homme, qui s’est tenue dans la salle de conférence du gouvernorat de Gao, a mobilisé  une centaine de participants. La cérémonie était présidée par madame Ndeye Yandé Kane, représentante du Chef du Bureau de la MINUSMA à Gao et non moins responsable de la Division des droits de l’homme et de la protection de la Mission à Gao.

Après les discours du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies et du Haut-Commissaire des droits de l’homme, lus respectivement par madame Ndeye Yandé Kane et son adjoint Jean Marie Kalama, place a été faite à la conférence débat sur le thème : "" Les avancées et les défis en matière de lutte contre l’impunité et l’administration de la justice"". Elle était animée par le substitut du procureur de Gao, un membre de l’association des victimes, le coordinateur régional de l’Association Malienne des Droits de l’Homme (AMDH), la Commission Régionale Vérité, Justice et Réconciliation…

Le premier intervenant, représentant le tribunal de Gao, a fait un bref état des lieux avant d’attirer l’attention des participants sur les difficultés que la justice rencontre sur le terrain. « Les défis auxquels nous sommes confrontés aujourd’hui sont entre autres le fait de ne pas pouvoir rendre justice au-delà de 30 kilomètres de la ville de Gao. C’est pour vous dire que la justice n’est opérationnel ni à Ansongo, ni à Bourem, encore moins à Ménaka. Une autre difficulté repose sur le port d’armes. Nous sommes dans une localité où les populations n’avaient autres choix que de se défendre elles même à un moment. C’est donc très difficile de contrôler les armes qui circulent de façon anarchiques… »  A expliqué le substitut du procureur de Gao, M. Mohamed Ould Mohamed Lamine.

Comme le substitut du procureur, les autres intervenants ont également mis l’accent sur les insuffisances de la justice, liées à l’insécurité et la lenteur dans le traitement des dossiers. « Nous sommes dans la nécessité de protéger les victimes et d’arrêter les bourreaux qui se promènent tranquillement dans la ville, comme si de rien n’était. Pourtant, nous avons monté des dizaines de dossiers qui ont été transmis à la justice et qui sont restés sous silence, » a témoigné M. Ibrahim Touré de la société civile.

Un accent particulier a été mis sur le rôle que joue la MINUSMA dans le déploiement des acteurs de la justice sur le terrain, la réhabilitation des locaux de la justice, le cadre de concertation des victimes… « C’est grâce à la MINUSMA que les services techniques de la Justice sont là et marchent. C’est le lieu d’exprimer toute notre gratitude pour toutes vos actions en faveur de l’appareil judiciaire, » a souligné le substitut du procureur, Mohamed Ould Mohamed Lamine.

Chaque panéliste de cette 70e journée internationale des droits de l’homme à Gao, s’accordaient sur le besoin d’une justice forte et accessible pour combattre l’impunité dans le but de soulager les populations qui continuent à perdre foi en la justice.",268,"French"
2372019,"Le PNUD et le FEM appuient le Bénin à renforcer la résilience des populations face aux risques climatiques Le Programme des Nations Unies pour le développement (PNUD) a signé ce jour avec le Gouvernement du Bénin à travers le Ministère du Plan et du Développement un document de projet d’un montant total de 34 950 000 USD (dont une contribution de 4 450 000 du Fonds pour l’Environnement Mondial et du PNUD) pour aider le pays à renforcer la résilience des populations rurales face aux risques climatiques.

Ce nouveau projet de Renforcement de la résilience des moyens de subsistance ruraux et du système de gouvernance locale face aux risques climatiques et à la variabilité du climat au Bénin contribuera à réduire la vulnérabilité aux impacts négatifs du changement climatique de plus de 10 000 agriculteurs dont 3281 femmes dans les communes de Bopa, Bohicon, Avrankou, Ouaké et Savalou à travers des infrastructures agricoles productives.

Procédant à la signature du document de projet, M. Abdoulaye Bio Tchané, Ministre d’Etat Chargé du Plan et du Développement a salué la présence de Madame Jeanne Acacha Akoha, Directrice de Cabinet du Ministre en charge du Cadre de vie pour les efforts de son département ministériel en matière de lutte contre les changements climatiques. Il a souligné le caractère transversal des changements climatiques, dont la non prise en compte compromettrait de plus en plus la mise en œuvre efficiente des programmes de réduction de la pauvreté et de développement d’une manière générale, tout en rappelant combien l’amélioration des conditions de vie des populations préoccupe le gouvernement béninois.

« Au-delà de l’éradication de la pauvreté, la réalisation d’une croissance économique inclusive et résiliente est devenu un défi majeur pour le pays ». Mais « les changements climatiques précarisent les conditions de vie des populations, qui déjà peinent à satisfaire leurs besoins essentiels », a-t-il ajouté. C’est donc face à cette situation que le Gouvernement a décidé d’agir urgemment pour trouver les moyens de renforcer la résilience des populations, pour que ces dernières puissent anticiper et surmonter les chocs liés aux changements climatiques. Le Ministre d’Etat a enfin salué l’accompagnement du PNUD pour la mobilisation des ressources nécessaires à la mise en route de ce projet.

« Le présent projet vise à soutenir une agriculture résiliente, à mettre en place des moyens de subsistance durables et à intégrer les considérations relatives aux risques climatiques dans les processus de planification à l’échelle nationale et locale, afin de réduire la vulnérabilité des communautés face aux effets néfastes des changements climatiques », a indiqué Monsieur Siaka Coulibaly, Coordonnateur Résident du Système des Nations Unies et Représentant Résident du PNUD au Bénin.

Ce projet contribuera sans nul doute au Programme d’Actions du Gouvernement  en ses piliers 2 et 3 relatifs à la transformation structurelle de l’économie et de l’amélioration des conditions de vie des populations et à la réalisation au niveau local des Objectifs de Développement Durable notamment les ODD 1 et 2 consacrés à l’élimination de la pauvreté et de la faim, les ODD 8 et 12 relatifs au travail décent et à une consommation et production responsable et enfin l’ODD 13 relatif à la lutte contre les changements climatiques, a expliqué Monsieur Siaka Coulibaly.

Le projet sera mis en œuvre sur une période de cinq ans, de 2017 à 2022, sous la direction technique du Centre de Partenariat et d’Expertise pour le Développement (CePED).

2372014,"Le GARR déplore la situation de droits humains à la frontière haïtiano-dominicaine Spécial Le 10 décembre 2017 marque le 69ème anniversaire de la Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l’Homme (DUDH) adoptée par l’Assemblée Générale des Nations Unies en 1948. Pour honorer cette adoption, la résolution  423 (V) du 4 décembre 1950 a consacré cette date, Journée internationale des droits de l’homme, célébrée depuis lors chaque année partout dans le monde.  Cette commémoration en Haïti est avant tout l’occasion d’évaluer la situation des droits de l’homme dans le pays et d’analyser les obstacles majeurs au respect des droits fondamentaux de la personne.

69  ans après la proclamation de la DUDH, Haïti peine encore à garantir  à ses nombreux fils et filles la jouissance de leurs droits fondamentaux. Partout dans le pays, les violations des droits de la personne sont criantes. Notre Etat semble faillir à sa triple mission de respecter, de protéger et de garantir les droits de ses ressortissantes et ressortissants. C’est  d’ailleurs l’un des facteurs qui les poussent à vouloir quitter, à tout prix, le pays pour émigrer à l’étranger dans des conditions souvent périlleuses.

La situation des droits humains est grave dans tout le pays. Considérons deux communes frontalières du département de l’Ouest : Cornillon/Grand-Bois et Ganthier. La commune de Cornillon ne dispose d’aucune adduction d’eau potable. Il y a deux centres de santé publique mais ils sont maintenant dysfonctionnels. Quant à sa 5ème section Génipailler, elle  ne dispose d’aucune école publique. Les infrastructures routières sont pratiquement inexistantes à l’intérieur de la commune. La route principale qui y conduit se trouve en de très piteux états. C’est toujours à grands risques qu’on s’aventure dans un voyage à Cornillon /Grand-Bois

Tout près de Port-au-Prince, dans la commune de Ganthier où se trouve le point frontalier Malpasse/Jimani, il y a deux sections : Mare Roseaux et Pays pourri qui sont oubliées par les autorités centrales. Elles ne disposent d’aucune infrastructure de base. Elles sont très éloignées du centre communal de Ganthier et aucune route carrossable n’y conduit. Même les motocyclettes ne peuvent y accéder. Ces sections ne sont accessibles qu’à pieds ou à dos de bêtes quand il ne pleut pas. Il n’y existe pas non plus de services de santé qui fonctionnent.

La situation n’est pas meilleure dans de nombreuses autres communes frontalières comme Anse-à-Pitres, Savanette, Thomassique, Baptiste, etc. Les violations de droits humains observées au niveau de ces zones frontalières affectent davantage certains groupes comme les femmes, les enfants, les personnes rapatriées, des usagères et usagers de la frontière aux conditions socioéconomiques difficiles. Ces catégories sont continuellement exposées aux abus de toutes sortes tant sur le territoire national que du côté de l’État voisin.

Dans ces conditions, les populations frontalières souffrent de manière systématique et chronique les violations de leurs droits fondamentaux. En plus des inégalités sociales de toutes sortes, l’inaccessibilité à des services sociaux de base tels que l’éducation, la santé, l’eau potable, le logement décent fait partie de leur quotidien. 

Certaines sections des communes frontalières ne bénéficient d’aucune présence des autorités étatiques. Et même dans le centre des communes frontalières, la Police Nationale d’Haïti  fonctionne avec un effectif très réduit et clame souvent son manque de moyens quand son intervention est requise. Cette situation pousse les membres de la population frontalière à recourir parfois à leurs propres pratiques pour trouver justice. Ce qui fait que la frontière devient le théâtre d’actes de représailles et de banditisme. 

A l’occasion de la commémoration du 69ème anniversaire de la Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l’Homme, le GARR renouvelle son engagement en faveur de la promotion et la défense des droits de la personne consignés dans la DUDH et dans d’autres instruments des droits humains. Il appelle le gouvernement haïtien en tant qu’obligataire des droits de l’homme à travailler pour s’acquitter de sa mission envers la population haïtienne en général, plus particulièrement envers les communautés des zones frontalières.

Il recommande aussi aux autorités haïtiennes d’établir des mécanismes adéquats de gestion des zones frontalières en vue d’y prévenir les divers types de conflits qui se transforment généralement en violence.

Il les exhorte enfin à faire un effort pour doter les zones frontalières d’infrastructures de base nécessaires et y implémenter des programmes socio-économiques. Ce qui permettra d’améliorer les conditions de vie de ces populations trop longtemps délaissées.",268,"French"
2372009,"Au moins 400 000 enfants sévèrement malnutris risquent de mourir dans la région instable du Kasaï en RD Congo posté le 12 DÉCEMBRE 2017 par YVES WILLEMOT  

COMMUNIQUE DE PRESSE – Les besoins des familles déplacées et rapatriées au Kasaï restent énormes après près de deux ans de conflit et de crise

KINSHASA / DAKAR / NEW YORK, 12 décembre 2017 – Au moins 400 000 enfants de moins de cinq ans dans la région du Kasaï en République Démocratique du Congo souffrent de malnutrition aiguë sévère et pourraient mourir en 2018 s’ils ne sont pas assistés par des interventions sanitaires et nutritionnelles, a déclaré l’UNICEF aujourd’hui. La situation désastreuse a été largement causée par la violence, les déplacements massifs et la réduction de la production agricole au cours des 18 derniers mois.

Alors que la situation sécuritaire s’est stabilisée dans certaines parties de la région et que des populations déplacées ont commencé à regagner leurs communautés, les conditions humanitaires restent critiques. Plus de 750 000 enfants dans la région souffrent de malnutrition aiguë, tandis que 25 zones de santé dans la région du Kasaï sont actuellement en situation de crise nutritionnelle avec des seuils d’urgence en matière de nutrition dépassés.

“Cette crise nutritionnelle et l’insécurité alimentaire dans la région du Kasaï font suite au déplacement de milliers de familles qui ont survécu pendant des mois dans des conditions très difficiles“, a déclaré le Dr Tajudeen Oyewale, Représentant par intérim de l’UNICEF en République Démocratique du Congo. “L‘ampleur réelle du problème se précise à mesure que les gens rentrent chez eux dans certaines zones où la sécurité s’est améliorée et où les services de santé ont recommencé à fonctionner“.

La violence et le déplacement de 1,4 million de personnes dans la région du Kasaï ont entraîné des pénuries alimentaires, les deux tiers des ménages étant incapables de travailler leur terre pour cultiver. L’insécurité alimentaire sévère affecte maintenant de grandes parties de la région, et les conditions ne devraient pas s’améliorer avant juin 2018, car les saisons de plantation en 2017 ont été perdues. Les familles n’ont pas pu récolter de produits sur leur terre et ils n’ont rien à vendre sur les marchés.

Les structures de santé ont également été dévastées, ce qui rend plus difficile le traitement et la prise en charge des enfants gravement malnutris. Environ 220 centres de santé ont été détruits, pillés ou endommagés, ce qui a entraîné un affaiblissement du système de santé, un accès réduit aux soins de santé et un risque accru de propagation de maladies transmissibles comme la rougeole.

“Garantir l’accès aux services de santé et de nutrition de base aux populations retournées est essentiel pour aider les enfants souffrant de malnutrition à survivre“, a déclaré le Dr Oyewale.

Depuis janvier 2017, l’UNICEF et ses partenaires ont fourni des soins nutritionnels thérapeutiques à 50 700 enfants souffrant de malnutrition aiguë sévère, âgés de 6 à 59 mois, dans la région du Kasaï. Cependant, Le Fonds des Nations Unies pour l’Enfance n’a reçu que 15 pour cent du financement nécessaire pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels des enfants en 2017.

**Note pour les éditeurs:**

Avec ses partenaires dans la région du Kasaï, l’UNICEF fournit une assistance multisectorielle dans les domaines de la santé, de l’eau, de la nutrition, de l’éducation et de la protection aux populations déplacées et aux retournés. Pour aider les enfants dans leur éducation, l’UNICEF met en place des écoles temporaires dans les communautés où les écoles ont été détruites et forme les enseignants à l’éducation à la paix et au soutien psychosocial. Depuis le début de la crise, l’UNICEF a aidé 800 enfants auparavant associés à des milices.

L’UNICEF met en œuvre des campagnes sanitaires à grande échelle, notamment la vaccination de 1,4 million d’enfants contre la rougeole et la distribution de moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide contre le paludisme ciblant 4,8 millions de personnes dans la région du Kasaï.

2372004,"Action climatique : l'ONU appelle à aider les pays en développement à hauteur de 100 milliards de dollars par an jusqu'en 2020 12 décembre 2017 – Deux ans après l'historique Accord de Paris, conclu à l'issue de la COP21 en 2015, la question du financement de la lutte contre le changement climatique est au centre du One Planet Summit.

Organisé le 12 décembre à Paris à l'initiative du Président français, Emmanuel Macron, du Secrétaire général de l'ONU, António Guterres et du Président de la Banque mondiale, Jim Yong Kim, le sommet réunit chefs d'Etat, secteurs publics et privés pour un engagement plus fort et plus concret du monde de la finance.

Le One Planet Summit a pour ambition de trouver de nouveaux moyens de financer l'adaptation de nos modes de vies aux transformations inéluctables, d'accélérer encore la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et d'ancrer les problématiques climat au cœur de la finance.

« Ceux qui échoueront à investir dans l'économie verte, se préparent un avenir bien sombre », a déclaré le Secrétaire général, lors de son discours d'ouverture. « Les énergies fossiles restent largement subventionnées, ce qui veut dire que nous continuons à investir dans notre propre perte », a-t-il poursuivi.

« Comme je l'ai entendu dire, l'âge de pierre ne s'est pas achevée par manque de pierre. Nous ne devons pas attendre l'épuisement des réserves de charbon et de pétrole pour mettre un terme à l'âge des énergies fossiles. Nous devons investir dans l'avenir et pas dans le passé », a souligné M. Guterres.

La Banque mondiale cessera de financer les activités en amont du secteur gazier et pétrolier après 2019
Afin d'honorer les engagements pris il y a deux ans à Paris, les investissements dans l'action climatique doivent se compter en milliers de milliards, a pour sa part rappelé le Président de la Banque Mondiale.

« Nous travaillons avec nos partenaires afin de mettre en place les mesures adéquates, d'orienter les forces du marché dans la bonne direction, de mobiliser des financements et d'accélérer l'action climatique », a précisé M. Kim.

« Nous annonçons aujourd'hui que le Groupe de la Banque mondiale ne financera plus de (projets) en amont de pétrole et de gaz après 2019 », a-t-il annoncé.

Changement climatique : « les pays en développement ne sont pas responsables du problème »
La mise en œuvre de l'Accord de Paris exige de nouveaux mécanismes de financement notamment pour les pays en développement qui comme l'a souligné le Secrétaire général « ne sont pas responsables du problème auquel ils ont à faire face, et ce n'est donc que justice que les pays développés les aident à mener ce combat ».

Pour le chef de l'ONU, « il faut avant tout veiller à ce que les pays riches honorent leur engagement et apportent 100 milliards de dollars par an jusqu'en 2020 à l'intention des pays en développement ».

Pour cela, il faut à la fois la mobilisation des capitaux privés, l'engagement des institutions du développement, y compris le Groupe de la Banque mondiale, pour créer la confiance et réduire les risques et la création, par les gouvernements, d'un environnement propice à ces investissements, a indiqué M. Guterres.",268,"French"
2371989,"L’Assemblée générale proclame le 12 décembre « Journée internationale de la couverture sanitaire universelle » AG/11992

ASSEMBLÉE GÉNÉRALE PLÉNIÈRE   
SOIXANTE-DOUZIÈME SESSION, 72E SÉANCE – MATIN

Au cours du débat sur la santé mondiale et la politique étrangère, ce matin, l’Assemblée générale a adopté deux résolutions par consensus, l’une invitant à célébrer chaque 12 décembre la « Journée internationale de la couverture sanitaire universelle » et l’autre encourageant à s’occuper de la santé des plus vulnérables pour une société inclusive et à consacrer une réunion de haut niveau à cette question, en 2019, à New York.

Actuellement, des millions de personnes meurent chaque jour de maladies évitables ou guérissables à cause d’un accès limité ou inexistant à des services de santé de qualité et à des médicaments essentiels, de qualité et abordables, a souligné la Thaïlande, qui a présenté les deux projets de résolution.  Dans certains cas, il n’existe même pas d’infrastructure de santé opérationnelle.

La Thaïlande a présenté ces projets au nom des sept membres fondateurs de l’« Initiative politique étrangère et santé mondiale », qui sollicitent chaque année, depuis 2008, une plus grande attention de la communauté internationale sur des sujets perçus comme des défis essentiels.  Cette année, les deux projets continuent de mettre en avant le lien intrinsèque entre santé mondiale et politique étrangère, tout en réaffirmant les engagements pris dans le cadre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030, en particulier celui de ne laisser personne sur le côté et de s’occuper, en premier lieu, des plus vulnérables.

Ainsi, la résolution intitulée « Santé mondiale et politique étrangère: s’occuper de la santé des plus vulnérables pour une société inclusive » souligne l’importance du droit de jouir du meilleur état de santé physique et mentale possible, et d’accorder une attention particulière à ceux qui sont vulnérables ou dans une situation vulnérable.

Comme l’a synthétisé la Thaïlande, le texte engage les États à faire plus pour les enfants, les femmes, les personnes âgées, les personnes handicapées, les personnes ayant des problèmes de santé mentale ou des troubles psychologiques, les personnes à risque, infectées ou affectées par le VIH/sida ou bien la tuberculose, le choléra et d’autres maladies, les personnes souffrant de résistance aux antimicrobiens ou d’autres maladies non transmissibles, les autochtones, les réfugiés, les déplacés et les migrants.

Les États-Unis ont émis des réserves sur la référence au futur pacte mondial pour des migrations sûres, ordonnées et régulières et ont souligné, se référant au paragraphe 14 de la résolution, qu’ils ne reconnaissent pas le « droit » à l’avortement.  Le Saint-Siège a également dénoncé des « libellés très controversés ».  « Les soins de santé procréative et sexuelle forment un ensemble dont l’avortement ne fait pas partie. »

La résolution note par ailleurs qu’il est « urgent que les engagements tendant à renforcer le partenariat mondial pour le développement soient tenus » pour accélérer la lutte contre les inégalités sanitaires.  Les Maldives ont insisté sur le caractère « crucial » de la coopération internationale, la crise d’Ebola et l’épidémie de Zika étant venues rappeler que les crises sanitaires dépassent largement les frontières.

Dans leur très longue explication, les États-Unis ont insisté sur le caractère « non contraignant » du Programme 2030 et du Programme d’action d’Addis-Abeba sur le financement du développement.  Ils ont défendu l’Accord de l’Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC) sur les aspects des droits de propriété intellectuelle qui touchent au commerce (ADPIC), « car c’est la protection de ces droits de propriété intellectuelle qui est le moteur de l’invention et de la distribution de médicaments essentiels ».

La résolution souligne également l’importance de systèmes de santé solides et résilients et de professionnels de santé efficaces.  Elle décide donc de consacrer une réunion de haut niveau à la couverture sanitaire universelle en 2019, à New York.  Un système de couverture sanitaire universelle est en effet le moyen le plus efficace de garantir un accès équitable à des services de santé et à des médicaments de qualité, a expliqué la Thaïlande.

Dans la foulée, l’Assemblée a décidé de proclamer le 12 décembre, « Journée internationale de la couverture sanitaire universelle » et invite les États Membres et les autres parties prenantes à célébrer la Journée comme il se doit et dans le respect des priorités nationales, afin de faire mieux comprendre la nécessité de disposer de systèmes de santé solides et résilients et d’une couverture sanitaire universelle.

Relevant le nombre de plus en plus important de défis à relever et d’épidémies intenses que souligne le rapport de l’Équipe spéciale pour les crises sanitaires mondiales, la Fédération de Russie s’est félicitée de l’idée de se concentrer sur la couverture sanitaire universelle.  Les États-Unis ont défendu le droit des pays à choisir leur régime de couverture selon leurs priorités et contextes nationaux, et se sont opposés à l’idée que toutes les initiatives doivent venir des gouvernements.  Les États-Unis n’étant ni partie au Pacte international relatif aux droits économiques, sociaux et culturels ni à son Protocole facultatif, les droits énoncés, y compris en matière de santé, ne sauraient être invoqués devant les cours et tribunaux américains, ont-ils insisté.

La prochaine réunion de l’Assemblée générale sera communiquée dans le Journal des Nations Unies.

Déclarations

M. VIRACHAI PLASAI (Thaïlande) a présenté deux projets de résolution au nom des sept membres fondateurs de l’Initiative politique étrangère et santé mondiale, à savoir l’Afrique du Sud, le Brésil, la France, l’Indonésie, la Norvège, le Sénégal et la Thaïlande.  Ce groupe, formé en septembre 2006, considère l’importance croissante de la santé mondiale et est conscient des défis persistants et émergents dans le domaine de la santé, à l’intérieur et au-delà des frontières.  Chaque année depuis 2008, l’Initiative présente donc à l’Assemblée générale des projets de résolution sur la santé mondiale et la politique étrangère pour mieux faire reconnaître l’interdépendance et le lien intrinsèque entre ces deux réalités, en abordant divers sujets perçus comme des défis essentiels demandant une plus grande attention de la part de la communauté internationale.

Cette année, a poursuivi le représentant, l’Initiative présente deux projets de résolution qui continuent à mettre en avant le lien effectif entre santé mondiale et politique étrangère, tout en réaffirmant les engagements pris dans le cadre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030, en particulier celui de ne laisser personne sur le côté et de s’occuper, en premier lieu, des plus vulnérables.

Le projet de résolution intitulé « Santé mondiale et politique étrangère: s’occuper de la santé des plus vulnérables pour une société inclusive » ([A/72/L.28](https://undocs.org/fr/A/72/L.28)) repose sur le fait que la santé n’est pas seulement un préalable mais aussi un résultat et un indicateur des trois dimensions du développement durable, a expliqué le représentant.  Afin de répondre aux défis liés à la santé de manière effective, la communauté internationale doit coopérer et adopter une approche inclusive, holistique et axée sur l’individu.  Il est donc impératif que les politiques étrangères prennent en compte la santé et ses liens avec d’autres déterminants sociaux, économiques et environnementaux.

Le projet de résolution souligne l’importance du droit au meilleur état de santé physique et mentale possible, notamment pour ceux qui sont vulnérables ou dans une situation vulnérable.  Actuellement, des millions de personnes meurent chaque jour de maladies évitables ou guérissables à cause d’un accès limité ou inexistant à des services de santé de qualité et à des médicaments essentiels, de qualité et abordables, a souligné M. Plasai.  Dans certains cas, il est alarmant de constater qu’il n’existe même pas d’infrastructure de santé opérationnelle.

Par conséquent, le projet de résolution appelle à accorder davantage d’attention à ceux qui sont souvent oubliés et à ceux dont la voix n’est qu’un murmure.  Il exhorte les États Membres à faire plus pour les enfants, les femmes, les personnes âgées, les personnes handicapées, les personnes ayant des problèmes de santé mentale ou des troubles psychologiques, les personnes à risque, infectées ou affectées par le VIH/sida ou bien la tuberculose, le choléra et d’autres maladies, les personnes souffrant de résistance aux antimicrobiens ou d’autres maladies non transmissibles, les autochtones, les réfugiés, les déplacés et les migrants.

Le projet de résolution souligne l’importance de garantir une bonne santé à tous, y compris la santé sexuelle et procréative, faisant en sorte que chacun puisse exercer ses droits en matière de procréation, conformément au Programme d’action de la Conférence internationale sur la population et le développement, au Programme d’action de Beijing sur les femmes et aux documents finaux des conférences d’examen qui ont suivi.

Le projet de résolution encourage les États Membres à assurer le financement à long terme et à investir dans les infrastructures de santé, notamment dans la recherche et le développement de nouveaux médicaments.  Il souligne la nécessité d’aider les États Membres, en particulier les pays en développement, dans leurs efforts visant à garantir à leurs concitoyens un accès à des services de santé et à des médicaments de qualité, y compris par le biais de mécanismes internationaux.

Le projet souligne l’importance de systèmes de santé solides et résilients et de professionnels de santé efficaces.  C’est la raison pour laquelle les membres de l’Initiative ont décidé de proposer à l’Assemblée, au paragraphe 24 du dispositif, de consacrer une réunion de haut niveau à la couverture sanitaire universelle en 2019 à New York.  Ils sont fermement convaincus, a expliqué M. Plasai, qu’un système de couverture sanitaire universelle est le moyen le plus efficace de garantir un accès équitable à des services de santé et à des médicaments de qualité.  Une telle couverture améliore la prestation de services pour tous les individus tout en veillant à ce qu’ils ne se retrouvent pas dans une situation financière précaire ou qu’ils ne tombent pas dans la pauvreté en raison de leurs factures de santé.  Ceci est en droite ligne avec les objectifs du Programme 2030 d’éliminer la pauvreté sous toutes ses formes et dans toutes ses dimensions, a ajouté le représentant.

Les coauteurs du projet sont convaincus qu’il est temps de discuter de la couverture sanitaire universelle au Siège des Nations Unies à New York.  Cette question, particulièrement dans le contexte du Programme 2030, couvre un champ bien plus large que la santé, a fait observer M. Plasai.  La volonté et l’engagement politiques au plus haut niveau possible sont nécessaires sur cette question essentielle pour l’avenir de l’humanité, a-t-il encore souligné.  C’est la seule manière de veiller à ce que des mesures concrètes soient adoptées dans le monde entier, ainsi que des partenariats mondiaux par le biais de la coopération Nord-Sud, Sud-Sud et triangulaire impliquant le secteur privé et d’autres acteurs pertinents.

Le représentant de la Thaïlande a ensuite présenté le projet de résolution intitulé « Journée internationale de la couverture sanitaire universelle » ([A/72/L.27](https://undocs.org/fr/A/72/L.27)).  À travers ce projet, l’Initiative politique étrangère et santé mondiale propose que le 12 décembre de chaque année soit proclamé Journée internationale de la couverture sanitaire universelle.  Le projet invite les États Membres et des parties prenantes à célébrer la Journée comme il se doit et dans le respect des priorités nationales, afin de faire mieux comprendre la nécessité de disposer de systèmes de santé solides et résilients et d’une couverture sanitaire universelle.  Le projet souligne également la nécessité pour tous d’avoir accès à des services de santé essentiels de qualité et à des médicaments et vaccins essentiels sûrs, efficaces, de qualité et d’un coût abordable.

Pour les coauteurs, l’adoption de ce projet aura une grande importance.  En effet, les pays qui célèbrent la Journée internationale le 12 décembre le feront un jour officiellement reconnu par les Nations Unies, qui se joindront ainsi à cette cause juste aux côtés des pays et des différents partenaires qui prônent la couverture sanitaire universelle depuis 2012.

Pour terminer, M. Plasai a indiqué que les textes finaux de ces projets de résolution sont le fruit du travail acharné des nombreuses délégations qui ont participé activement et constructivement aux négociations.  Votre soutien aujourd’hui est vital, a-t-il lancé à l’Assemblée, car il contribue à renforcer la mise en œuvre des objectifs de développement durable, en faisant avancer en particulier l’objectif commun de vies saines et du bien-être pour tous, à tous les âges, afin que personne ne soit laissé sur le côté.

Mme FATHMATH RAZANA (Maldives) a estimé que les investissements dans le secteur de la santé ne sont pas une fin en soi mais surtout un moyen d’avancer dans le développement socioéconomique.  C’est en tout cas l’expérience des Maldives, a dit la représentante, qui a indiqué que son pays consacre plus de 9% de son produit national brut aux dépenses de santé, soit le taux le plus élevé de la région de l’Asie du Sud-Est.  Aujourd’hui, l’espérance de vie y est de 78 ans, contre 47 en 1977, et le taux de mortalité maternelle de 45 pour 100 000 naissances contre 680.  Ce sont là des améliorations « spectaculaires », s’est enorgueillie la représentante, avant de passer aux progrès enregistrés dans le contrôle et l’élimination de plusieurs maladies contagieuses.  Le pays est devenu le premier de sa région à avoir été proclamé par l’OMS en 2015 « zone sans paludisme », éliminant aussi la filariose lymphatique et la rougeole.  La polio ainsi que le tétanos maternel et néonatal avaient déjà été éliminés tandis que la lèpre n’est plus un problème de santé publique depuis 2000.  Les Maldives figurent également parmi les rares pays qui ont atteint les cibles mondiales pour d’autres maladies dont la tuberculose. 

Pour toutes ces raisons, les Maldives ont pu émerger de la liste des pays les moins avancés (PMA).  C’est une grande fierté mais, en tant que petit État insulaire, il est difficile de passer au prochain niveau de développement, s’agissant en particulier des efforts visant à réaliser les objectifs de santé et liés à ce secteur du Programme 2030, car ils exigent des investissements énormes.  La représentante a donc souligné le caractère « crucial » de la coopération internationale, la crise d’Ebola et l’épidémie de Zika étant venues rappeler que les crises sanitaires dépassent largement les frontières et exigent une coopération plus forte aux niveaux international, régional et sous-régional.  Nous devons trouver des idées novatrices, de nouveaux partenariats et de nouveaux mécanismes pour mieux combattre les crises sanitaires, en mettant l’accent sur l’appropriation nationale, les résultats, l’inclusivité et les responsabilités partagées, a conclu la représentante.

M. SERGEY B. KONONUCHENKO (Fédération de Russie) a exprimé sa reconnaissance à l’OMS pour avoir préparé le rapport sur les crises sanitaires mondiales, qui montre qu’il y a de plus en plus de défis à relever et d’épidémies intenses, résultant de l’urbanisation et de la pauvreté.  Le représentant s’est félicité de l’idée de se concentrer sur la couverture sanitaire universelle, et sur les plus vulnérables.  Il a dit accorder une grande importance à la formation du personnel de santé et a soutenu les deux projets de résolution, dont l’idée des réunions de haut niveau sur les maladies non transmissibles et la tuberculose en 2018 et sur l’accès à la santé universelle en 2019.  La Fédération est prête à faire sa part, a promis le représentant, qui a indiqué que, s’agissant de la tuberculose, l’OMS a déjà réuni, à Moscou, les représentants de nombreux pays et du secteur privé qui se sont mis d’accord sur des recommandations lesquelles, il faut espérer, seront examinées aux réunions de haut niveau.  Concernant les maladies non transmissibles, il a rappelé que la Conférence de l’OMS, à Montevideo, sur les politiques pouvant contribuer à réaliser les objectifs de développement durable sur la santé et l’éducation, a montré le lien de cause à effet entre ces deux secteurs.  La santé s’améliore mais de nombreux traitements sont toujours trop chers et la pauvreté se réduit trop lentement, a alerté le représentant.

S’agissant de la couverture sanitaire universelle, Mme LAURIE SHESTACK PHIPPS (États-Unis) a estimé que les États Membres doivent pouvoir choisir leur propre régime, conformément à leurs priorités et contextes nationaux.  Mon pays, a-t-elle dit, s’oppose à l’idée que la couverture sanitaire universelle ne peut être assurée que par les gouvernements.  Pour les États-Unis, les documents cités dans les projets de résolution dont le Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030 et le Programme d’action d’Addis-Abeba sur le financement du développement ne sont pas des textes « contraignants » et ne créent, par conséquent, ni droit ni obligation au regard du droit international.

Chaque pays doit pouvoir établir ses propres priorités de développement et travailler à leur mise en œuvre, conformément à ses propres politiques nationales.  Pour les États-Unis, le Programme 2030 n’est pas un engagement à créer un nouveau marché des biens et services.  Le Programme n’interprète ni ne change aucun accord ou décision de l’Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC), dont l’Accord sur les aspects des droits de propriété intellectuelle, qui touchent au commerce (ADPIC). 

Quant au Programme d’action d’Addis-Abeba, a poursuivi la représentante, le libellé sur les questions commerciales a, depuis juillet dernier, été dépassé par les évènements.  Ils sont donc « immatériels ».  Elle a dénoncé un libellé « inacceptable » sur l’Accord sur les ADPIC et la Déclaration de Doha sur cet Accord et la santé publique.  Les États-Unis, a-t-elle prévenu, ne sauraient accepter que l’ONU et certains de ses membres profitent des fora autres que l’OMC pour essayer d’interpréter les règles et les accords de l’OMC.  Ceci pourrait conduire, a-t-elle dit craindre, à une mauvaise interprétation des obligations commerciales internationales et avoir un impact négatif sur la faculté des pays à encourager la fabrication de nouveaux médicaments et à en élargir l’accès.

Car c’est en effet la protection des droits de propriété intellectuelle qui est le moteur de l’invention et de la distribution de médicaments essentiels et les résolutions de l’ONU ne sauraient être le format approprié pour réinterpréter les engagements commerciaux, au risque de porter préjudice aux négociations en cours ou de préjuger des négociations futures dans différents fora.

La représentante a aussi tenu à souligner le consensus international selon lequel les Programmes d’action de Beijing et du Caire ne créent aucun nouveau droit international, et certainement pas le « droit » à l’avortement.  Pour les États-Unis, l’avortement n’est pas une méthode de planification familiale et il ne fait pas partie des services de santé reproductive. 

Les États-Unis ne soutiennent pas non plus la référence au futur pacte mondial pour les migrations, a ajouté la représentante, avant de rappeler que son pays n’est ni partie au Pacte international relatif aux droits économiques, sociaux et culturels ni à son Protocole facultatif.  Les droits énoncés dans ce Pacte, y compris celui de bénéficier des normes les plus élevées en matière de santé, ne sauraient être invoqués devant les cours et tribunaux américains. 

Mgr TOMASZ GRYSA, du Saint-Siège, a réaffirmé son attachement à la jouissance des meilleures conditions de santé physique et mentale, soulignant que les efforts doivent garantir la dignité humaine, y compris la qualité de vie et la qualité de la santé.  Concernant le projet de résolution [A/72/L.28](http://undocs.org/fr/A/72/L.28), il a fait part de sa préoccupation sur l’inclusion de libellés très controversés qui ne servent pas le consensus.  Il a estimé que les soins de santé procréative et sexuelle forment un ensemble dont l’avortement ne fait pas partie, insistant sur le droit à la vie.  Concernant l’égalité des sexes, il a fait observer que ce n’est pas une question de psychologie ou de statut social.

2371954,"Nord du Burkina Faso : ce que cache le jihad - Rapport Afrique N°254 **Synthèse** 

Longtemps épargné par les groupes armés actifs au Sahel, le Burkina Faso est confronté à des attaques de plus en plus fréquentes et meurtrières visant la partie nord du pays. Si l’insécurité résulte en grande partie d’une extension du conflit malien, la crise au Nord du Burkina révèle une dynamique sociale endogène. 

Présenté comme lié aux jihadistes actifs dans le Sahel, le groupe armé Ansarul Islam, qui semble être l’acteur principal de l’insécurité, est avant tout un mouvement de contestation de l’ordre social qui prévaut dans la province du Soum, dans la région burkinabè du Sahel. Malgré une reprise en main de la situation au printemps 2017, la crise est loin d’être terminée. Le Burkina et ses partenaires sont conscients qu’elle exige une réponse globale, et non uniquement militaire, et que sa résolution définitive dépend en partie de la situation au Mali. Mais cette réponse doit surtout tenir compte des dimensions sociales et locales de la crise, qui prévalent sur ses dimensions religieuses ou sécuritaires. 

Ansarul Islam, créé par Malam Ibrahim Dicko, un prêcheur originaire du Soum, est né de la contestation de l’organisation sociale en vigueur dans la province. Des années durant, Malam prône l’égalité entre les classes sociales. Il remet en cause la toute-puissance des chefferies coutumières et le monopole de l’autorité religieuse détenu par les familles maraboutiques, qu’il accuse de s’enrichir aux dépens des populations. Cette rhétorique lui vaut un écho considérable, surtout parmi les jeunes et les cadets sociaux. Même s’il perd une grande partie de ses adeptes lorsqu’il bascule dans la lutte armée, il parvient à en conserver suffisamment pour mener une guerre de basse intensité contre les autorités locales et nationales. L’éventualité de sa mort au cours d’opérations militaires menées au printemps 2017, qui n’a pas été prouvée ni confirmée, ne mettrait pas fin à la crise. 

Produit des réalités sociopolitiques et culturelles locales, Ansarul Islam tient au moins autant de l’insurrection sociale que du mouvement islamiste. Il n’est pas tant un groupe critique de la modernité qu’un mouvement qui rejette des traditions perçues comme archaïques. Il exprime les doléances de la majorité silencieuse de la population qui ne détient ni le pouvoir politique, ni l’autorité religieuse. L’islam devient alors un référent de contestation d’une société figée productrice de frustrations.  
Ansarul Islam n’est pas non plus un groupe de défense des Peul, majoritaires dans le Sahel burkinabè. La revendication ethnique et identitaire est pour le moment marginale dans son discours. 

Le rapport distant qu’entretiennent les populations avec l’Etat nourrit également la crise. Le contraste entre le potentiel économique du Nord et le manque de développement alimente un sentiment d’abandon des populations. Comme au Mali, fonctionnaires et forces de sécurité sont plus souvent perçus comme des corps étrangers cherchant à s’enrichir que comme des agents chargés de fournir des services. Les habitants du Soum sont réticents à collaborer avec des forces de sécurité venues d’autres provinces et au comportement parfois brutal. 

La crise au Nord du Burkina est beaucoup plus que le simple miroir de la situation au centre du Mali. Certes, le Mali sert de base arrière à Ansarul Islam. Des similarités existent. Mais la poussée de la violence qui se revendique du jihad conduit à négliger la dimension sociale et extrêmement locale des conflits et la capacité des groupes armés à exploiter les clivages qui traversent certaines sociétés. L’insécurité au Nord du Burkina ne résulte pas uniquement d’un déficit de développement, d’une incompréhension entre un Etat central et un territoire lointain ou de l’influence négative d’un voisin en guerre. Elle est surtout le résultat d’une crise profonde qui agite les groupes humains qui habitent les terroirs du Nord. C’est sur ces fractures très locales entre maitres et sujets, dominants et dominés, anciens et modernes que Malam Dicko a bâti sa popularité.",268,"French"
2371699,"Force du G5 Sahel : trouver sa place dans l’embouteillage sécuritaire *Créée en février 2017, la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel est une force de nouvelle génération dans un espace sahélien où se bousculent des initiatives militaires et diplomatiques parfois concurrentes. Il ne suffira pas de fournir des armes et de l’argent pour résoudre les crises sahéliennes. Pour atteindre ses objectifs, la force doit gagner la confiance des populations et des puissances régionales et obtenir leur soutien.*

**Que se passe-t-il ?**  Dix mois après son lancement, la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel (FC-G5S), fruit de l’initiative de cinq pays du Sahel visant au règlement des conflits armés sahéliens, soulève de nombreuses questions et peine à trouver sa place dans la région.
 
**En quoi est-ce significatif ?**  Le succès ou l’échec de cette force dépendra de sa capacité à se positionner dans l’embouteillage des diverses forces armées présentes dans le Sahel et à gagner la confiance des populations.
 
**Comment agir ?**  Les efforts de cette force armée doivent s’accompagner d’une action politique, ils doivent être coordonnés avec ceux des autres forces et acteurs régionaux et internationaux et reposer sur un financement solide de ses bailleurs.
 
**Synthèse**
Dix mois après son lancement, la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel (FC-G5S), initiative commune à cinq pays du Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritanie, Niger et Tchad), prend forme peu à peu. Elle s’appuie désormais sur deux résolutions du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies, possède son propre quartier général et a effectué, début novembre, sa première mission aux confins du Mali, du Niger et du Burkina Faso. Cette force, qui est importante pour remédier à l’inquiétante instabilité dont souffre le Mali et plus largement le Sahel, reste à construire. Elle soulève de nombreuses questions sans réponses quant à son financement, sa capacité opérationnelle, la coopération politique entre ses cinq membres et sa place dans un espace sahélien où se bousculent des initiatives militaires et diplomatiques parfois concurrentes. Réunis à l’occasion de la conférence de Paris du 13 décembre visant à parfaire son opérationnalisation, les promoteurs de la FC-G5S devront avoir à l’esprit que la construction de cette force, et plus largement le règlement des crises sahéliennes, n’est pas uniquement une affaire d’armes et d’argent.

Composante d’une organisation plus large nommée G5 dont le lancement a eu lieu en 2014, la FC-G5S est une force qui reste largement expérimentale. Elle résulte d’une volonté croissante, tant du continent que des acteurs extérieurs, de mettre en œuvre ce type de réponse militaire de nouvelle génération dans un contexte où le concept onusien de maintien de la paix, inadapté à des conflits asymétriques et au terrorisme suscite de plus en plus de scepticisme.

Sans se désengager complètement du Sahel, la France et les autres pays européens présents dans cette région tentent de limiter leur présence militaire au sol et de diminuer le coût financier de leurs opérations extérieures en déléguant une partie de celles-ci à leurs partenaires africains et à des drones. Pour la France et l’Allemagne en particulier, le Sahel reste une région stratégique pour leurs intérêts économiques et politiques. Elle est surtout perçue comme une menace potentielle pour leur propre sécurité, et une source de migration et de terrorisme. Les Etats africains, quant à eux, ne font plus confiance à leurs propres organisations régionales et continentales pour garantir leur sécurité et expérimentent donc de nouvelles pistes en matière de défense collective, nommées forces ad hoc par les spécialistes.

La FC-G5S a été créée peu après une autre force ad hoc, la Force multinationale mixte (FMM), lancée par quatre pays (Cameroun, Niger, Nigéria et Tchad) et qui combat, depuis 2012, l’insurrection de Boko Haram dans le bassin du lac Tchad. Comparée à cette force cousine, la force du G5 présente de nombreuses faiblesses : ses armées ont des capacités moindres et ses membres sont beaucoup moins riches. Là où la FMM agit avec l’appui discret de puissances occidentales contre un ennemi unique, le G5 évolue dans une région où les groupes armés sont plus d’une vingtaine, ce qui complique la définition d’une cible commune. De plus, cette nouvelle force devra trouver sa place dans une région où opèrent déjà les forces de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (Minusma), l’opération française Barkhane et un contingent américain dont le nombre exact d’hommes reste un mystère.

Le succès ou l’échec de cette nouvelle force dépendra en grande partie de son positionnement dans cet embouteillage sécuritaire et de l’articulation de son action avec des armées qui sont sur place depuis 2013. S’il est assez clair que l’opération française Barkhane servira de tuteur à la FC-G5S, sa collaboration avec la Minusma, à laquelle les Etats membres du G5 fournissent 35 pour cent de ses effectifs, l’est beaucoup moins. L’aide logistique que pourrait apporter la Minusma à la FC-G5S ne peut par exemple pas être régionale, car le mandat de stabilisation de cette mission concerne uniquement le Mali.

Sa réussite sera aussi liée à la capacité qu’auront ses promoteurs à l’intégrer dans un cadre plus large, doté d’objectifs politiques. Dans les zones où agit la force du G5 et si elle arrive à les pacifier, des espaces de négociation locaux doivent être rapidement ouverts et des canaux de communication avec certains chefs de groupes jihadistes, issus des terroirs sahéliens doivent être maintenus ou réactivés. La FC-G5S atteindra son objectif si elle parvient à isoler les groupes jihadistes des communautés locales et des autres groupes armés, qui leur apportent actuellement du soutien.

Pour ce faire, la FC-G5S a besoin de l’appui et de la confiance de ses propres populations. Leurs droits doivent donc être strictement respectés. Les bavures et les exactions à leur encontre pousseront, à coup sûr, ces populations du côté de groupes jihadistes, habiles à offrir protection et promesse de vengeance. Dans ce domaine, la FMM est un exemple à ne pas suivre, car la brutalité de ses armées, en particulier celle du Nigéria, a poussé des milliers de citoyens, apeurés ou en colère, à rejoindre les rangs de Boko Haram.

Le G5 et sa force armée devront aussi gagner la confiance de l’Algérie et de la Communauté économique des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (Cedeao). Pour l’instant, ces deux puissances régionales lui préfèrent le processus de Nouakchott regroupant onze pays d’Afrique de l’Ouest, du bassin du lac Tchad et du Maghreb et donc jugé plus inclusif. A leurs yeux, ce processus est aussi plus légitime, car initié par l’Union africaine. Faute d’une meilleure entente avec ces deux partenaires, la recherche de plus de cohésion régionale débouchera paradoxalement sur de nouvelles divisions entre voisins. De même, sa lente et difficile construction et les énergies qu’elle mobilise ne doivent pas faire oublier qu’un processus de paix est en cours et piétine au nord du Mali, et qu’il est à ce jour la seule solution politique à une crise qui avant d’être militaire est éminemment politique et sociale. En somme, la FC-G5S ne doit pas seulement être une façade qui cache une absence de vision politique.

**Recommandations**

Les droits des populations vivant dans les zones où opère la FC-G5S doivent être strictement respectés, faute de quoi une partie de ces populations, à la recherche de protection, se rangera du côté des groupes jihadistes actifs au Sahel. Cela nécessite une sensibilisation des personnels militaires, policiers et judiciaires des pays du G5 aux droits humains fondamentaux ; la mise en place de voies de recours juridiques pour les familles des personnes tuées ou arrêtées dans le cadre des opérations de la force du G5 ; la conformité avec le cadre de référence en matière de droits humains et de droit humanitaire international défini par  le Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme ; et la prise de sanctions exemplaires contre les auteurs de violations des droits humains.
 
La FC-G5S doit être une composante d’un projet qui va au-delà de la répression et qui intègre la recherche de solutions politiques aux crises sahéliennes. Son opérationnalisation doit s’accompagner de la promotion de négociations au niveau local visant à traiter la cause des conflits et à inciter certains chefs de groupes jihadistes, issus des terroirs sahéliens, à s’engager dans le dialogue.
 
Un travail diplomatique parallèle à l’action de la force doit être mené par les pays du G5 et la France, son principal soutien. Cette action a pour premier objectif de calmer les inquiétudes que suscite l’opérationnalisation de la FC-G5S auprès de l’Algérie et de la Cedeao afin de créer une unité régionale qui dépasse les frontières du G5 Sahel et de s’assurer que ces deux puissances régionales travailleront avec le G5 et non contre lui.
 
La coopération militaire bilatérale des Etats-Unis doit être aménagée pour mieux coïncider avec les autres forces présentes au Sahel. Les Etats-Unis, s’ils veulent lutter contre les groupes jihadistes, ont intérêt à ce que leur coopération bilatérale ne duplique pas mais complète celle que la France, l’Union européenne et les Nations unies apportent à la FC-G5S.
 
La FC-G5S doit reposer sur des moyens financiers importants. Ses bailleurs gagneraient à lui apporter des financements immédiats et effectifs et non des promesses de dons. Ils devraient se montrer suffisamment généreux pour aller au-delà du budget initial demandé et garantir à la force un financement sur le long terme.

2371684,"Vers une action concertée en RDC *Les manœuvres dilatoires du président Kabila paralysent la transition politique de la République démocratique du Congo alors que les dissensions internes et la répression gouvernementale affaiblissent l’opposition. Face à une crise de plus en plus grave, les acteurs occidentaux et africains doivent coordonner leur approche, soutenir les efforts déployés en vue de mener des élections démocratiques et encourager l’ouverture de l’espace politique.*

**Que se passe-t-il ?**  L’apparente détermination du président Joseph Kabila à rester au pouvoir risque de prolonger la situation d’impasse dans laquelle se trouve la République démocratique du Congo (RDC). Le régime a détourné l’accord de la Saint-Sylvestre de décembre 2016 qui prévoyait un processus électoral ; il gagne en confiance tandis que l’opposition s’affaiblit et devient plus divisée.

**En quoi ces évènements sont-ils significatifs ?**  La RDC est déjà le pays qui traverse la plus grave crise humanitaire du monde. La violence s’est accrue dans plusieurs provinces et le risque d’une escalade de la violence est élevé. Un éclatement rapide de la violence pourrait avoir des conséquences désastreuses pour la stabilité du pays et de la région.

**Comment agir ?**  Les puissances occidentales et régionales doivent redoubler d’efforts pour promouvoir une transition pacifique. Le calendrier électoral annoncé récemment est l’occasion pour la communauté internationale de renouveler son engagement, de préférence conformément aux principes de l’accord de la Saint-Sylvestre. L’opposition congolaise et la société civile devraient participer à ce processus politique et non le boycotter.

**Synthèse**

La République démocratique du Congo (RDC) est toujours dans une impasse politique et les violences se sont multipliées dans plusieurs provinces au cours de l’année 2017. Pourtant, le régime du président Joseph Kabila semble déterminé à rester au pouvoir en reportant les élections. Il a déjoué les stratégies de l’opposition et des acteurs internationaux. Ce blocage peut s’avérer très dangereux pour la stabilité du pays et de la région ; plus la crise se prolonge plus il sera difficile de sauver la situation. Pour minimiser ces risques, les puissances occidentales et africaines doivent vaincre leur inertie et dégager un consensus sur les moyens de faire pression sur Joseph Kabila. Dans ce sens, il pourrait être utile de revoir les mécanismes de coordination internationale pour la RDC. Une approche occidentale et africaine conjointe devrait se concentrer sur le suivi des préparatifs basés sur le calendrier électoral publié récemment et contribuer à ouvrir l’espace public et à faire régner la confiance nécessaire au déroulement crédible et pacifique du vote et au maintien de la stabilité après le scrutin.

Depuis la signature le 31 décembre 2016 de l’accord de la Saint-Sylvestre, qui stipulait que les élections devaient avoir lieu en 2017 et que le président Kabila devait quitter le pouvoir, le régime s’est retranché dans ses positions et a usé l’opposition jusqu’à l’affaiblir complètement. Faisant fi de l’accord, le régime de Kabila contrôle le gouvernement et le conseil national de suivi de l’accord, ainsi que la commission électorale. Il n’a pas de stratégie à long terme pour assurer son maintien au pouvoir, il n’en a pas besoin. Le contrôle qu’il exerce sur les finances de l’Etat et les principales institutions, la faiblesse de l’opposition après la mort de son chef de file historique, Etienne Tshisekedi, et la perte d’intérêt de la communauté internationale lui ont permis de contourner la mise en œuvre de l’accord.

Le Rassemblement, principale coalition de l’opposition, est resté relativement cohérent, mais il est faible et a perdu son attrait auprès d’une population nerveuse. Il demande la mise en place d’un gouvernement de transition sans Kabila pour la fin de 2017, ce qui n’a aucune chance de se produire. La faiblesse de l’opposition et les méthodes répressives du régime ont ouvert la voie aux groupes armés. Insurrections, évasions massives des prisons, réactions féroces ou maladroites des forces de sécurité se sont intensifiées en 2017. Certains éléments laissent penser que les groupes armés tentent de coordonner leurs positions, ce qui pourrait menacer la stabilité de la région. Au moins dix provinces sont désormais en prise avec les conflits armés, ce qui donne lieu à la crise humanitaire la plus complexe et la plus problématique du monde. Les pays voisins, en particulier l’Angola et la République du Congo, s’inquiètent à la perspective de voir arriver une nouvelle vague de réfugiés sur leur territoire. C’est un cercle vicieux : à mesure que le gouvernement perd le contrôle du pouvoir, il recourt à des méthodes fortes, au mépris de l’état de droit, et se sert ensuite de l’instabilité qui en découle pour justifier le report des élections, ce qui met de l’huile sur le feu.

La commission électorale, après des mois de retard, a finalement publié son calendrier électoral, prévoyant l’élection présidentielle le 23 décembre 2018, un an après la date fixée dans l’accord de la Saint-Sylvestre. Le gouvernement a les coudées franches et risque de faire trainer encore davantage les préparatifs électoraux. La faible participation des acteurs internationaux s’explique, d’une part, par leur sentiment de frustration au vu de l’intransigeance des parties, et, d’autre part, par leurs propres désaccords concernant les moyens de faire pression sur le gouvernement. De nombreuses puissances occidentales sont devenues plus critiques vis-à-vis du régime et l’Union européenne (UE) et les Etats-Unis ont déjà imposé des sanctions à une vingtaine de représentants congolais. Les chefs d’Etat africains, en revanche, ont laissé le gouvernement violer l’esprit et la lettre de l’accord de la Saint-Sylvestre et tendent à considérer que les sanctions occidentales sont inopérantes. Bien que ni les acteurs occidentaux ni les acteurs africains ne parlent d’une même voix, les divisions profondes qui les séparent permettent au gouvernement de choisir les interlocuteurs et les avis qui l’arrangent et de taxer les pressions internationales de néo-colonialistes. Le nombre considérable d’acteurs en présence, dont une multitude d’organisations régionales, rendent la situation d’autant plus problématique.

Les puissances occidentales et africaines doivent commencer par affirmer que le président Kabila conduit le pays vers une grave situation d’instabilité, malgré l’incertitude qu’une transition pourrait générer. Même si nombreux sont ceux qui estiment qu’il est très peu probable que le régime actuel abandonne le pouvoir, il reste essentiel de faire avancer les préparatifs électoraux et de faire en sorte que les élections aient lieu et que la scène politique reste ouverte. Tous les acteurs internationaux ont intérêt à ce que le président Kabila respecte les principes fondamentaux de l’accord de la Saint-Sylvestre qui restent la meilleure garantie d’une sortie de crise, à savoir l’organisation effective d’élections, le refus d’un amendement de la constitution qui permettrait au président Kabila de rester au pouvoir, l’ouverture de l’espace politique et le respect des droits de l’homme.

En privé, les dirigeants africains reconnaissent les dangers existants, mais il est plus difficile de vaincre les forces d’inertie. Kabila jouit ainsi d’un soutien public constant sur le continent qui donne à son régime une grande marge de manœuvre. Les puissances occidentales devraient redoubler d’efforts pour dépasser les différends avec leurs homologues africains, entendre leurs préoccupations et, pour l’heure, éviter d’imposer de nouvelles sanctions. Même unies, les puissances occidentales et régionales ne parviendront pas aisément à pousser Kabila vers la transition et à sortir la RDC de la situation actuelle. Si elles sont divisées, les chances d’y parvenir deviennent infimes.

Pour que la diplomatie régionale et internationale connaisse un nouvel élan en RDC, il faudrait créer un groupe composé de quelques représentants d’institutions déjà engagées dans l’appui du processus électoral (Union africaine, Nations unies, Francophonie, UE et Communauté de développement de l’Afrique australe) et de préférence en présence des Etats-Unis. Idéalement, la diplomatie africaine et occidentale devrait se réunir autour d’un consensus pour promouvoir les points suivants :

Respect d’un calendrier électoral et d’un budget transparent. La publication récente d’un calendrier électoral réaliste, qui donne à l’opposition le temps de s’organiser avant le vote, est une occasion de s’engager activement dans le processus électoral. Les acteurs internationaux impliqués dans la préparation des élections, y compris l’ONU, les groupes régionaux et l’UE, devraient surveiller que le calendrier est respecté et dénoncer les reports injustifiés. Le gouvernement et la commission électorale (CENI) devraient en priorité clarifier et détailler le financement de ces élections. La CENI devrait également indiquer rapidement ce que représente, d’un point de vue financier et opérationnel, le vote semi-électronique qu’elle a proposé. Chaque proposition devra comprendre une évaluation approfondie et ouverte de ses répercussions sur le calendrier électoral. Le parlement doit très rapidement adopter la législation électorale correspondante. La législation électorale, tout comme d’autres initiatives juridiques, devra éviter de restreindre l’activité politique.

Mise en œuvre des mesures de renforcement de la confiance discutées au préalable. Le gouvernement devrait établir un processus crédible d’évaluation de la légalité et de la validité des poursuites à l’encontre de plusieurs responsables de l’opposition. Il devrait également autoriser les manifestations politiques pacifiques, l’activité des partis et une couverture médiatique libre. Les acteurs internationaux, y compris les acteurs régionaux, devraient veiller à ce que le gouvernement applique ces mesures. Les initiatives récentes, telles que la restriction de la loi sur la société civile, vont à l’encontre de l’accord de la Saint-Sylvestre et risquent d’entacher la transparence du processus électoral.

Renforcement de l’engagement des partis d’opposition dans ce processus. Plutôt que de boycotter les négociations ou de refuser de participer à des discussions essentielles, comme celles relatives au calendrier électoral, les chefs de l’opposition devraient renforcer leur engagement dans ce processus, y compris en remettant activement en cause la manipulation par le régime de la sphère judiciaire. L’opposition devrait changer de discours et aborder les questions économiques cruciales, prouvant ainsi sa pertinence à des citoyens méfiants. Les dirigeants de l’opposition devraient également préparer les structures et la base de leur parti en vue des prochaines élections.

Enfin, les acteurs internationaux, y compris l’ONU, doivent se préparer à la possibilité d’une détérioration de la situation sur le court terme. Le Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies devrait analyser attentivement les recommandations de l’examen stratégique de septembre 2017 de la mission des Nations unies, en particulier les points concernant un déploiement plus rapide des forces et la surveillance du respect des droits de l’homme. Le risque d’une escalade de la violence dans les prochains mois est élevé et les acteurs internationaux, y compris les Nations unies, devraient se préparer au mieux aux conséquences d’une telle éventualité.

Nairobi, Bruxelles, 4 décembre 2017",268,"French"
2371419,"Le nombre de victimes de mines en hausse dans les zones de conflit (Washington, DC, le 14 décembre 2017) : Deux décennies après l’ouverture à la signature du traité interdisant les mines antipersonnel, l’utilisation nouvelle de ces armes par des états est extrêmement rare et les pays continuent leurs efforts pour mettre un terme au fléau que représente les mines d’ici 2025.  

Cependant, selon le rapport 2017 de l’Observatoire des mines, les conflits armés en Afghanistan, en Libye, en Ukraine, et au Yémen ont entraîné pour la deuxième année consécutive à un nombre exceptionnellement élevé de victimes de mines, dont des dispositifs improvisés qui s’enclenchent comme des mines, et d’autres restes de guerre Le dernier rapport annuel de la Campagne internationale pour interdire les mines, lauréate du prix Nobel de la paix, est publié aujourd’hui. « 

Quelques conflits intenses, où l’indifférence totale pour la sécurité des civils persiste, ont abouti à des nombres très élevés de victimes de mines pour la deuxième année consécutive. » a déclaré Loren Persi rédacteur de la section sur les victimes et l’assistance aux victimes du rapport 2017 de l’Observatoire des mines. « Cela démontre la nécessité pour tous les pays d’adhérer au Traité d’interdiction des mines et pour des niveaux accrus d’assistance aux victimes des mines. » Pour l’année civile 2016, l’Observatoire des mines a recensé 8 605 victimes de mines et restes explosifs de guerre, dont au moins 2 089 personnes ont été tuées. Après la forte augmentation enregistrée en 2015, le total de victimes pour 2016 représente le total annuel de victimes enregistrées le plus important de ceux rapportés par l’Observatoire des mines depuis 1999 (9 228), le plus grand nombre d’enfant jamais rapporté parmi les victimes, et le total annuel de victimes de mines improvisées le plus élevé. Bien qu’étant des armes de guerre ; les mines et les restes explosifs de guerre tuent et blessent principalement des civils, qui ont représenté 78% des victimes recensées en 2016, un niveau comparable à ceux des années précédentes.  

De façon plus positive, les contributeurs internationaux ont augmenté leur soutien à l’action contre les mines, un terme générique qui englobe le déminage, l’assistance aux victimes, l’éducation aux risques, la destruction des stocks, les activités de suivi et de plaidoyer. Trente-deux donateurs ont contribué 479,5 millions en assistance internationale pour l’action contre les mines dans 40 États et trois autres territoires, une augmentation d’environ 85,5 millions de dollars par rapport à 2015. Les contributions par les états affectés pour leurs propres programmes nationaux ont totalisé 85 millions en 2016. Globalement, les contributions à l’action contre les mines se sont élevées à approximativement 564,5 millions de dollars, une augmentation d’environ 40 millions de dollars par rapport à 2015.  

En 2016, les pays ont continué leurs efforts considérables pour rendre des zones anciennement minées accessibles et utilisables en toute sécurité, et ont rapporté la libération d’au moins 170 km2 de terres—un niveau similaire à celui de 2015—et la destruction de plus de 232 000 mines—une augmentation conséquente par rapport à 2015. Parmi les 61 pays et autres territoires connus pour être contaminés par les mines, 33 sont des États parties au Traité d’interdiction des mines, qui prévoit le déminage des zones contaminées connues dans un délai de 10 ans. Seulement quatre d’entre eux semblent être en mesure de respecter leurs délais de déminage : le Chili, la Mauritanie, le Pérou, et la République démocratique du Congo.

« Il est encourageant que les donateurs internationaux aient augmenté leur soutien à l’action contre les mines en 2016 et que plus de pays soient libérés des mines, » a déclaré Jeff Abramson, coordinateur de l’Observatoire des mines et des armes à sous-munitions et responsable éditorial du rapport 2017 de l’Observatoire des mines. « Une détermination soutenue et encore plus importante est nécessaire pour atteindre l’objectif d’un monde exempt de mines d’ici 2025. » Lors de la dernière Conférence d’examen du traité, les États parties se sont engagés à achever leurs obligations respectives d’ici 2025.  

L’utilisation nouvelle de mines antipersonnel par les États demeure un phénomène relativement rare, c’est seulement au Myanmar et en Syrie—deux États non parties au Traité d’interdiction des mines—que des forces gouvernementales ont encore activement posé des mines au cours de l’année passée (d’octobre 2016 à octobre 2017). Pendant cette période, les groupes armés non-étatiques ont utilisé des mines antipersonnel, notamment des mines improvisées, dans au moins neuf pays : en Afghanistan, en Inde, en Irak, au Myanmar, au Nigeria, au Pakistan, en Syrie, en Ukraine, et au Yémen.  

Le Traité d’interdiction des mines, qui est devenu une norme de droit international en 1999 et comptabilise 162 Etats parties à ce jour, interdit l’utilisation de mines qui explosent par contact humain, également désignées comme « activées par les victimes, » ainsi il s’applique également aux engins explosifs improvisés qui agissent comme des mines antipersonnel, aussi appelés mines improvisées.  
Parmi les autres conclusions du rapport :

- Collectivement, les États parties ont détruit plus de 53 millions de mines antipersonnel stockées, dont plus de 2,2 millions ont été détruites en 2016.

- Le Belarus a achevé la destruction de ses stocks en avril 2017.

- Les États parties de l’Angola, de l’Equateur, de l’Irak, de la Thaïlande, et du Zimbabwe attendent l’approbation de leurs demandes de prolongation de leurs délais de déminage qui seront étudiées lors de la Seizième Assemblée des États parties en décembre 2017.

- L’Ukraine est en violation du Traité d’interdiction des mines pour avoir dépassé sa date butoir du 1er juin 2016 pour le déminage sans avoir demandé ou obtenu une prolongation. Elle est également en violation du traité pour avoir dépassé sa date butoir pour la destruction de ces stocks.

2370339,"Les associations s’opposent au tri des personnes sans abri Les associations nationales d’hébergement et de lutte contre l’exclusion ont été réunies aujourd’hui 8 décembre 2017 par le ministre de l’ Intérieur et le ministre de la Cohésion des Territoires pour une présentation du projet gouvernemental d’examen de la situation administrative des étrangers présents dans les centres d’hébergement accueillant les sans-abri.  

Cette orientation prévue par circulaire répond à la volonté de l’Etat d’identifier, dans les centres d’hébergement , les personnes étrangères dont le statut administratif est précaire, notamment les personnes sous statut Dublin ou déboutées du droit d’asile.  

Des équipes mobiles, constituées d’agents de l’OFII et des préfectures , feront des visites de contrôle dans les centres d’hébergement.  

Lors de cette rencontre ce matin, les associations ont dit aux ministres que cette réunion ne pouvait en rien se substituer à l a demande de rendez - vous avec le Président de la République qu’elles ont saisi par courrier le 14 novembre 2017.  

Dans un contexte d’extrême saturation du parc hébergement, les associations ont réaffirmé les principes et priorités de leur action vis-à-vis des étrangers :

- L’ accueil inconditionnel de toute personne en situation de détresse présente sur le territoire est un principe socle du code de l’action sociale et des familles : il s’oppose au tri des sans-abri en fonction de leur situation administrative. Ce principe qui constitue l’ADN des associations de lutte contre l’exclusion n’est pas négociable.  

C’est également un marqueur fort des valeurs de solidarité et républicaines de notre pays.

- Les services de police ne peuvent intervenir dans les centres d’hébergement en dehors de l’application d’une décision de justice.

- La CNIL encadre strictement la transmissio n d’informations individuelles : les associations veilleront scrupuleusement au respect de ce cadre légal .

- le renforcement des mesures de contrôle des personnes dans les lieux d’hébergement va précariser les personnes, dont des familles avec enfants, les éloigner des structures d’accueil en favorisant ainsi la reconstitution de squats et campements indignes, particulièrement dans les grandes villes.  

Enfin les associations rappellent que l ’Etat a toujours la possibilité de requalifier le statut des personnes sous Dublin afin qu’elles puissent demander l’asile en France et bénéficier des conditions d’hébergement et d’accompagnement garanties par le droit commun.  

Sur ces principes - notamment le respect du principe d’accueil inconditionnel dans l’hébergement et le respect des missions d’accompagnement des associations en faveur des personnes en situation de précarité, quel le que soit leur situation – les associations réitèrent leur demande d’être reçues et entendues par le chef de l’Etat.

Le gouvernement a commencé à évacuer quelque 2 000 migrants de Tripoli à la suite de récentes dénonciations de traitements inhumains par les passeurs. Les autorités avaient auparavant informé les migrants désireux de rentrer chez eux de la possibilité de rapatriement. Jusqu'à présent, l'ambassade du Niger à Tripoli a enregistré 3 850 migrants. Le gouvernement a également mis des vols à disposition pour ces opérations. L'OIM fournira de la nourriture à l'arrivée et pendant le transport vers leurs villages d'origine.

*DE NOUVEAUX SITES POUR RÉDUIRE LA CONGESTION DES CAMPS*

Le HCR a ouvert deux nouveaux sites dans deux provinces de l'est afin de réduire la congestion des camps et accueillir plus de réfugiés. Le premier site au Sud-Kivu accueillera 5 000 Burundais qui vivront avec la communauté hôte et partageront leurs ressources. Le second site qui est dans le Haut-Uele accueille déjà 500 personnes et peut accueillir jusqu'à 43 000 personnes. Environ 90 000 Burundais,  
Centrafricains et Sud-Soudanais ont fui en RDC l'année dernière, portant à plus de 500 000 le nombre de réfugiés dans le pays

**CAMEROUN**

*10 PERSONNES PERDENT LA VIE DANS LE SUD-OUEST DU CAMEROUN*

Au moins 10 personnes ont été tuées les 7 et 10 décembre dans la région du Sud-Ouest, laquelle, avec le Nord-Ouest, connaît des manifestations et violences en protestation de la marginalisation présumée de ces régions par le gouvernement. Plus de 5 000 personnes ont déjà fui vers le Nigeria. Ce chiffre risque d’augmenter avec l'escalade des tensions

*BESOINS HUMANITAIRES EN HAUSSE POUR 2018*

Environ 4,1 millions de personnes auront besoin d'une aide humanitaire en 2018, contre 3,7 millions en 2017, selon les dernières évaluations. L'insécurité alimentaire affectera plus de 22% de la population contre 19% cette année. Près de 800 000 personnes – 200 000 de plus qu'en 2017 –, parmi lesquelles la moitié sont des femmes, feront face à des situations d'insécurité alimentaire « de crise » et «d'urgence » et auront besoin d'aide alimentaire et agricole urgente.

**TCHAD**

*L'INSÉCURITÉ ALIMENTAIRE AUGMENTE MALGRÉ UNE BONNE RÉCOLTE*

Bien que les récoltes devraient dépasser la moyenne des cinq dernières années, les faibles précipitations dans certaines zones du Sahel ont provoqué d'importantes pénuries de céréales et de pâturages. Au total, 3,5 millions de personnes seront en insécurité alimentaire durant la période de soudure, qui commencera certainement plus tôt dans les zones les plus touchées. Quelque 889 000 personnes seront confrontées à des niveaux de « crise » et « d’urgence » d'insécurité alimentaire. Alors que les chiffres globaux sont similaires à ceux de 2017, davantage de personnes sont tombées dans le « niveau d'urgence » (de 36 000 en 2017 à 101 000 en 2018). De plus en plus de départements sont également frappés par l’insécurité alimentaire sévère. Le chiffre ne comprend pas les 411 000 réfugiés ni 60 000 rapatriés tchadiens qui ont également besoin d'aide alimentaire.",268,"French"
2370264,"2.100 familles bénéficieront de transferts monétaires au Kasaï Central et Kasaï Oriental Le Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés lancera, cette semaine, l’opération de transferts monétaires aux personnes vulnérables dans les Provinces du Kasaï Central et du Kasaï Oriental. Avec ses partenaires, les ONG ActionAid et Conseil norvégien pour les réfugiés, le HCR compte soutenir 2.100 ménages composés de plus de 16.000 personnes.  
Les bénéficiaires des distributions ont été identifiés avec les communautés.  

Il s’agit des déplacés internes, des familles d’accueil et des retournés. Il y a parmi eux des personnes âgées, des femmes chefs de ménage et d’autres personnes extrêmement vulnérables.  

Les localités ciblées ont été fortement affectées par les violences pendant la crise au Kasaï. Elles se trouvent dans les territoires de Dimbelenge et Kazumba (dans la Province du Kasaï Central) et de Kabeya Kamwanga (dans la Province du Kasaï Oriental).  

Ces personnes recevront de l’argent en espèces et, dans certains cas, des bons d’achats électroniques qui leur permettront d’acheter des biens de première nécessité ou de relancer leurs activités économiques.  

Au-delà de cela, 200 ménages dans le territoire de Kazumba recevront également une assistance qui leur permettra de reconstruire leurs maisons.  

Les évaluations dans la phase préparatoire du programme ont clairement démontré que la destruction des abris est l’un des principaux problèmes qui freinent le retour et la réintégration de la population déplacée. Il y a un besoin urgent de renforcer la réponse humanitaire pour la reconstruction des logements. Le HCR compte élargir ce programme en 2018 après cette première phase.",268,"French"
2370234,"Deux ans après l'Accord de Paris, le One Planet Summit vise à initier de nouvelles mesures relatives aux changements climatiques Le 12 décembre 2017, à l'occasion de l'anniversaire de l'adoption de l'Accord historique de Paris sur les changement climatiques, de nombreux dirigeants de la communauté internationale se retrouvent dans la capitale française dans le but d'accélérer les engagements pour ralentir les changements climatiques.

[The One Planet Summit](https://www.oneplanetsummit.fr/en/) qui réunira le Président Français, le Président de la Banque mondiale et le Secrétaire général des Nations Unies, entre autres dirigeants, vise à mobiliser de nouvelles annonces de projets audacieux et d'engagements financiers substantiels pour lutter contre les changements climatiques. Le Sommet présentera également des initiatives réussies qui pourraient être généralisées si elles bénéficiaient d'un soutien adéquate.

La bonne nouvelle est que les mesures pour la protection du climat sont en marche dans tous les pays et à tous les niveaux, de nombreux secteurs commence déjà à s'aligner sur l'Accord de Paris et les objectifs de développement durable plus larges.

170 pays ont déjà ratifié l'Accord de Paris, entré en vigueur en moins d'un an - un record moderne pour un tel traité mondial.

De nombreux pays ont élaboré et sont en train de mettre en œuvre leurs plans d'action nationaux pour le climat dans le cadre de l'Accord de Paris. Certains domaines avancent rapidement : de nouvelles données indiquent que la croissance mondiale des énergies renouvelables comme l'énergie éolienne et solaire double tous les 5,5 ans.

> Cent soixante-dix pays ont déjà ratifié l'Accord de Paris, entré en vigueur en moins d'un an - un record des temps modernes pour un tel traité mondial.

Les coûts de ces technologies sont en train de dégringoler : dans de nombreux endroits, l'énergie éolienne est aussi bon marché que le charbon, quant à l'énergie solaire, elle se rapproche rapidement de la compétitivité économique des combustibles fossiles. Plus de 40 pays, menés par l'Inde et récemment rejoints par la Chine, ont signé l'International Solar Alliance qui vise à générer 1 000 GW d'énergie solaire d'ici 2030.

Les villes, les états, les régions et les territoires soutiennent l'action climatique dans le cadre d'initiatives telles que la Under2Coalition des gouvernements infranationaux. Ils ont promis de réduire les émissions de 95% à l'horizon 2050 grâce à une initiative touchant plus de 1,3 milliard de personnes et représentant 30 billions de dollars de production économique, soit 17% de la population mondiale et près de 40% de l'économie mondiale.

De nombreuses entreprises à la pointe progressent également dans les pays développés et en développement. Plus de 100 entreprises aux États-Unis, en Europe, en Chine et en Inde se sont engagées à utiliser 100% d'énergie renouvelable dans le cadre de l'initiative RE100.

Le monde de la finance, tant public que privé, adopte également de nouvelles initiatives et de nouveaux instruments comme les obligations vertes. En octobre, ONU Environnement et Rabobank [ont annoncé](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/rabobank-and-un-environment-announce-new-billion-dollar-partnership) la création d'une nouvelle facilité d'un milliard de dollars pour financer l'agriculture durable en se reposant sur un co-financement public-privé. Lors de la conférence de l'ONU sur le climat le mois suivant, le gouvernement de la Norvège et la multinationale Unilever ont annoncé 400 millions de dollars pour les forêts et les petits agriculteurs en Amazonie.

> En septembre 2018, l'État de Californie, avec l'aide de l'Organisation des Nations unies et d'autres partenaires clés, organisera une grande conférence pour accélérer les initiatives et sera suivie par la Conférence des Nations Unies sur le climat en Pologne plus tard dans l'année.

L'Allemagne a lancé un partenariat mondial avec le G20, le groupe de pays vulnérables V20, et des sociétés privées pour accélérer la mise en oeuvre d'une assurance abordable à l'horizon 2020 pour 400 millions des personnes les plus pauvres, grâce à l'engagement de 125 millions de dollars supplémentaires.

JP Morgan Chase et HSBC ont récemment déclaré qu'un total de 200 milliards de dollars et 100 milliards de dollars seront investis dans des projets et initiatives verts au cours des prochaines années.

Selon l'Initiative sur les politiques climatiques, les flux annuels moyens de financement climatique s'élèvent à plus de 400 milliards de dollars par an. Mais l'ampleur des flux financiers, en particulier dans les pays les plus pauvres, ne correspond pas à la rapidité et à l'ampleur nécessaires pour que l'action climatique et le programme plus large du développement durable correspondent à l'urgence de la situation. Certains pays développés s'inquiètent également du fait que le strict minimum - 100 milliards de dollars promis par les pays développés d'ici 2020 - reste incertain.

En septembre 2018, l'État de Californie, avec l'aide de l'Organisation des Nations unies et d'autres partenaires clés, organisera une grande conférence pour accélérer les initiatives et sera suivie par la Conférence des Nations Unies sur le climat en Pologne plus tard dans l'année.

2370214,"Identification et evaluation des pratiques et technologies pour une Agriculture Intelligente face au Climat (AIC) au Bénin La présente étude a été initiée en vue d’approfondir les connaissances et d’apporter des éléments scientifiques sur l’adéquation des pratiques agricoles au regard des piliers de l’AIC au Bénin et d’en déduire les bonnes pratiques. L’étude vise spécifiquement à 1) faire l’état des connaissances disponibles sur les technologies et bonnes pratiques relatives aux trois piliers de l’AIC, 2) faire la compilation et une analyse des différentes technologies et bonnes pratiques par sous-secteur, 3) proposer des options recommandées de pratiques tenant compte des contextes environnementaux et sociaux économiques spécifiques. 

L’approche méthodologique utilisée comporte essentiellement deux phases complémentaires: une revue de littérature et une analyse multicritère de hiérarchisation des pratiques basées sur des indicateurs définis pour chaque pilier AIC. Du fait du manque de données scientifiques, l’évaluation des indicateurs a été faite à travers une enquête auprès des experts (personnes ressources) nationaux des sous-secteurs complétées par des informations issues de la littérature. 

Pour faire face aux impacts des changements climatiques, plusieurs pratiques existent ou ont été développées. Nombre d’entre elles sont climato-intelligentes et permettent d’augmenter la productivité, de développer la résilience tout en limitant les émissions de GES. Mais ces dernières restent relativement peu connues sous cet angle à l’échelle nationale. Les pratiques AIC offrent plusieurs opportunités pour faire face aux défis actuels des changements climatiques. Ces technologies/pratiques varient selon les sous-secteurs (production végétale, production animale, production halieutique, chaîne de valeur ajoutée, foresterie) du secteur agricole et surtout des impacts des changements climatiques perçus par les producteurs. 

Pour le sous-secteur de la production végétale, les pratiques sont liées à la prévention et à la gestion du risque climatique, à l’information climatique, à la gestion des systèmes de culture et du calendrier agricole, des pratiques de gestion du matériel végé-tal de production, des pratiques de conservation physique des eaux et des sols et des pratiques de conservation biologique des eaux et des sols. Les pratiques prioritaires en production végétale sont: l’utilisation des variétés améliorées (variétés à cycle court, résistantes à la sècheresse, aux maladies); le paillage des cultures (utilisation des ré-sidus de récolte, de paille ou de film polyéthylène pour pailler le sol); le Système Amé-lioré de Production (SAP) (Assolement-rotation dans l’exploitation agricole); l’irrigation localisée (goutte à goutte ou microdiffuseur) et la gestion des semis (resemis, sursemis, changement de date de semis). 

Les pratiques/technologies AIC du secteur de la production animale visent essentiellement l’amélioration des systèmes d’élevage, des techniques de reproduction et l’alimentation des animaux par valorisation des sous-produits de la production végétale sans pour autant compromettre l’environnement. Les pratiques prioritaires en élevage sont: l’introduction de races améliorées, le croisement avec les races locales pour une bonne résistance aux maladies; la constitution des réserves alimentaires pour la saison sèche (foin, ensilage, etc.); le recours à de nouvelles sources d’aliments (légumineuses arbustives, paille de riz, etc.); la culture de variétés fourragères résistantes et la pratique de mobilité saisonnière du bétail. 

Les pratiques/technologies de production halieutique visent à améliorer les systèmes d’élevage, la gestion des espèces halieutiques, la gestion de la qualité de l’eau et de l’alimentation. Les pratiques prioritaires ici sont: l’élevage des poissons en bassins; l’introduction de souches de poisson à cycle court (tilapia); l’utilisation des bacs hors sol; des cages flottantes et les étangs piscicoles et la fertilisation des étangs piscicoles.

Les pratiques/technologies du secteur de la foresterie visent l’aménagement des forêts et des plantations, une exploitation rationnelle des ressources naturelles, la sauvegarde des écosystèmes, la préservation de l’environnement et la lutte contre la déforestation ainsi que l’agroforesterie. Les pratiques prioritaires en foresterie sont: les plantations/ reboisements (domaniales, communales ou à grande envergure y compris les mangroves à l’aide des palétuviers et espèces à croissance rapide; les pratiques améliorées de gestion (labour, fauchage, éclaircie, lutte contre les parasites animaux et végétaux…) des plantations et parcs forestiers; la culture en couloirs/agroforesterie (cultures annuelles entre les rangées d’arbres); la domestication et la plantation des espèces fruitières locales adaptées au climat et la conservation des eaux et des sols.  

Pour le sous-secteur des chaînes de valeur ajoutée, les pratiques/technologies visent le stockage, la conservation des produits, les transformations locales des produits agricoles et l’utilisation rationnelle des ressources naturelles en faisant aussi la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies propres (énergies renouvelables). Les pratiques prioritaires ici sont: la fabrication et la promotion de nouveaux produits agroalimentaires (jus de fruits, vinaigre, amandes fermentées de baobab, alcool d’ananas, etc.); l’utilisation de nouvelles sources de matières organiques pour l’énergie domestique (balles de riz, coque de palmiste, sciure); les foyers traditionnels améliorés; le cuiseur à vapeur pour les mets locaux (ex.: Ablo) et les séchoirs solaires.  

Les lacunes des données sont similaires dans tous les sous-secteurs. En général, très peu de pratiques/technologies sont abordées par la communauté scientifique en termes d’AIC. Pour le pilier de la productivité, les analyses coûts-bénéfices sont rares, de même que les données liées aux pertes post-récolte. Pour le pilier de l’adaptation, les données existantes regroupent souvent la disponibilité et l’efficience d’utilisation de l’eau, mais les informations sur la contribution des pratiques à gérer ou prévenir les risques climatiques sont très rares et restent qualitatives. Enfin, pour le pilier de l’atténuation, il faut remarquer que les efforts ne sont qu’à leurs débuts et nécessitent d’approfondissement.  

Les informations existantes sur l’atténuation sont, pour la plupart, liées à la foresterie et à la production animale. Dans la plupart des autres secteurs, il existe très rarement des estimations renseignant de façon détaillée sur la quantification des émissions des GES par pratique.

L’analyse des contraintes et des difficultés de l’adoption par technologie/pratique a montré qu’il y a 1) une insuffisance de programmes scientifiques d’évaluation des pratiques, 2) une insuffisance des capacités des acteurs, 3) un défaut de financement de la recherche et des acteurs pour l’adoption.

Des recommandations ont été faites en fonction des différentes zones agroécologiques pour l’amélioration et la mise à échelle des bonnes pratiques identifiées pour une agriculture intelligente face au climat.",268,"French"
2370204,"Démarrage du rapatriement volontaire des réfugiés soudanais **Bangui, le 12 décembre 2017** — Le gouvernement centrafricain a démarré ce jour 12 décembre, avec l’appui du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les Réfugiés (HCR), le rapatriement volontaire de quelques 1500 réfugiés soudanais du camp de Pladama Ouaka, dans le centre de la Centrafrique à Bambari vers Nyala, une localité située dans le sud du Darfour au Soudan.  

En effet, au courant du mois d’octobre dernier, les réfugiés soudanais du camp de Pladama - Ouaka avaient librement et volontairement exprimé leur volonté de retourner dans leur pays d’origine. Ils avaient confirmé ce désir le 21 novembre 2017 lors de leur visite par les autorités soudanaises qui étaient venues s’enquérir de leur situation dans ce camp. 

“Nous avons décidé de retourner volontairement à Dafaq, une de nos destinations finales, parce que nous sommes bien informés qu’avec la mise en œuvre effective des activités de désarmement des groupes armés, la sécurité y est revenue”, explique Ahmat l’un des leaders réfugiés du camp de Pladama Ouaka. 

“Cette volonté de retour exprimée par les réfugiés a été fortement attestée par un sondage qu’a effectué le HCR au sein de la communauté des réfugiés et qui a révélé que parmi les 1700 réfugiés que compte le camp de Pladama-Ouaka, 1500 sont favorables au rapatriement vers le Soudan, leur pays d’origine”, a expliqué Buti Kalé, Représentant du HCR en Centrafrique. 

“Le rapatriement volontaire étant la meilleure solution durable aux problèmes des réfugiés, le HCR se réjouit de ce développement et notre Agence facilite cette opération avec les gouvernements centrafricain et soudanais,” a ajouté Kale.

“Pendant toute la durée de leur séjour en Centrafrique, le gouvernement centrafricain a pris toutes les mesures nécessaires pour assurer la sécurité de ces réfugiés et protéger leurs droits. Il en sera de même pour le reste qui optera d’être intégré localement” a déclaré Valerie Yamande, Secrétaire Générale de la Commission Nationale pour les Réfugiés (CNR). “Aujourd’hui, nous sommes heureux avec la grande partie des réfugiés qui ont exprimé librement leur souhait de retourner chez eux, car on n’est mieux que chez soi”, a précisé la Secrétaire Générale de la CNR.

Pour rendre effectif ce rapatriement, le HCR a affrété deux avions dont un est destiné au transport des réfugiés et l’autre au transport de leurs bagages. Ces avions effectueront plusieurs rotations par semaine entre Bambari et Nyala. A partir de Nyala, les équipes du HCR et du gouvernent soudanais accompagneront ces réfugies vers leurs destinations finales.  

Les réfugiés soudanais du camp de Pladama Ouaka sont arrivés en Centrafrique en mai 2007, en raison des combats qui opposaient le gouvernement du Soudan aux groupes rebelles dans le sud du Darfour.

2370179,"Le HCR recherche 1 300 places de réinstallation d’urgence pour des réfugiés vulnérables en Libye Le HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés, a lancé aujourd’hui un appel urgent pour la mise à disposition de 1 300 places de réinstallation d’ici fin mars 2018 pour des réfugiés très vulnérables qui sont bloqués en Libye.

« C’est un appel désespéré à la solidarité et à l’humanité. Nous devons faire tout notre possible pour que des réfugiés extrêmement vulnérables quittent la Libye dès que possible », a déclaré Volker Türk, Haut Commissaire assistant du HCR chargé de la protection internationale.

« De nombreux réfugiés, demandeurs d'asile et apatrides en Libye sont victimes d’effroyables violations des droits de l'homme, y compris différentes formes de traitements inhumains, cruels et dégradants », peut-on lire dans [l’appel éclair du HCR](https://reliefweb.int/node/2368349/), soulignant également que beaucoup d'entre eux sont détenus pour une durée indéterminée dans des conditions déplorables.

En tant qu’organisation en charge de la protection des réfugiés, le HCR est fermement opposé à la détention systématique des réfugiés et des personnes déplacées, et plaide continuellement pour des alternatives à la détention et des systèmes d’asile équitables.

« Compte tenu des besoins humanitaires imminents et de la détérioration rapide des conditions de vie dans les centres de détention en Libye, le HCR s’emploie activement à organiser davantage d’évacuations de réfugiés vers le Niger dans les semaines et les mois à venir », a indiqué Volker Türk. Un premier groupe de 25 réfugiés de nationalité érythréenne, éthiopienne ou soudanaise avait été évacué depuis la Libye vers le Niger le mois dernier.

Des réfugiés vulnérables vont être évacués vers le Niger et, nous l’espérons, dans d’autres installations de transit d’urgence en attendant leur réinstallation vers des pays tiers. Il s’agit notamment d’enfants non accompagnés, de mères célibataires, de femmes en danger, de personnes souffrant d’affections médicales graves ainsi que de personnes ayant été gravement torturées ou maltraitées au cours de leur voyage ou qui sont détenues en Libye.

« Du fait de la situation humanitaire critique survenant actuellement en Libye et des conditions déplorables dans les centres de détention, le HCR appelle une nouvelle fois la communauté internationale à faire preuve de solidarité », a déclaré Volker Türk.

« Compte tenu de la situation déplorable des réfugiés en Libye, nous devons explorer toutes les possibilités de solutions durables, y compris la réinstallation, le regroupement familial, l’évacuation vers les installations d’urgence gérées par le HCR dans d’autres pays, ou le retour librement consenti », a-t-il ajouté.

2370159,"L'ONU lance une campagne d'un an pour marquer les 70 ans de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme 11 décembre 2017 – Les Nations Unies ont lancé une campagne d'un an pour honorer la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme, un document fondamental qui fêtera l'an prochain son 70e anniversaire.

« En sept décennies, ce document important a contribué à changer profondément notre monde. Il établit l'égalité et la dignité de chaque être humain. Il stipule que chaque gouvernement a le devoir de permettre à tous les peuples de jouir de leurs droits et libertés inaliénables. Et il établit que ces droits sont universels », a souligné lundi le Secrétaire général de l'ONU, António Guterres, lors d'une manifestation au siège de l'Organisation à New York.

« Où que nous vivions, quelles que soient nos circonstances ou notre place dans la société, notre sexe ou notre orientation sexuelle, notre race, notre religion ou notre croyance, nous sommes tous égaux en termes de droits humains et de dignité », a-t-il ajouté.

La Déclaration universelle proclame les droits inaliénables de tout être humain sans distinction de race, de couleur, de religion, de sexe, de langue, d'opinion politique, d'origine nationale ou sociale, de naissance ou d'autre statut. C'est le document le plus traduit au monde, disponible dans plus de 500 langues.

La campagne pour honorer ce document été officiellement lancée dimanche au Palais de Chaillot, à Paris.

Lundi, le chef de l'ONU a tenu à rappeler que les droits de l'homme ne sont liés à aucune tradition, culture ou croyance. « Lorsque les nations ont adopté la Déclaration universelle en 1948, elles ont reconnu la diversité des cultures et des systèmes politiques. Mais elles ont également affirmé que la Déclaration était un 'standard commun à atteindre pour tous les peuples et toutes les nations' », a-t-il dit.

M. Guterres s'est félicité des succès enregistrés au cours de ces dernières décennies. « En sept décennies, l'humanité a accompli des progrès considérables. Les gens du monde entier ont progressivement gagné en libertés et en égalité », a-t-il noté.

« Mais, nous devons aussi faire le point sur ce qui nous manque », a-t-il ajouté. « Dans la pratique, la reconnaissance de la dignité et des droits égaux des êtres humains est encore loin d'être universelle. Des millions de personnes continuent de subir des violations des droits humains et des abus dans le monde entier ».

Le Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l'homme, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, a également souligné que grâce à la Déclaration universelle, la vie quotidienne de millions de personnes a été améliorée.

« Le fait même qu'elle ait résisté à l'épreuve du temps témoigne de l'universalité durable de ses valeurs éternelles d'égalité, de justice et de dignité humaine », a-t-il ajouté.

La période précédant le 10 décembre 2018, le jour du 70e anniversaire de la Déclaration universelle, sera « une année de réflexion intense et profonde sur l'importance continue et vitale de chacun des 30 articles contenus dans ce document extraordinaire », a encore noté le Haut-Commissaire.",268,"French"
2370139,"L’Assemblée générale apporte des améliorations à ses résolutions sur l’aide humanitaire « pour refléter la réalité actuelle » AG/11991  
11 DÉCEMBRE 2017

L’Assemblée générale a terminé aujourd’hui son débat sur le renforcement de la coordination de l’aide humanitaire et des secours en cas de catastrophe fournis par les organismes des Nations Unies, en adoptant, sans vote, quatre résolutions dont la résolution omnibus et son dispositif de 74 paragraphes qui, cette année, comportent un certain nombre d’améliorations « pour refléter la réalité humanitaire actuelle ». 

C’est ce qu’avait affirmé, vendredi dernier, la Suède lors de la présentation du texte omnibus sur le renforcement de la coordination de l’aide humanitaire d’urgence.* La résolution, expliquait-elle, place un accent particulier sur la situation alarmante en matière de sécurité alimentaire et sur les risques de famine, y compris les forces motrices de ces crises, dont les conflits.  Elle comprend un libellé plus robuste sur la protection des écoles et la nécessité d’assurer la protection de l’environnement scolaire pendant les urgences humanitaires.  

Elle a aussi un libellé plus fort sur la sûreté et la sécurité du personnel médical et les soins pendant les conflits armés et offre une plateforme plus solide pour la réforme et le financement de l’aide humanitaire, soulignant la responsabilité des donateurs et des acteurs humanitaires ainsi que l’importance des modalités telles que la mise en commun des fonds au niveau des pays.

La résolution engage d’ailleurs tous les États Membres, le secteur privé et toutes les personnes et institutions intéressées à envisager d’accroître leurs contributions volontaires au Fonds central pour les interventions d’urgence afin de porter le financement annuel à un milliard de dollars des États-Unis d’ici à 2018.

Par le texte sur « la sûreté et sécurité du personnel humanitaire et le personnel des Nations Unies »**, entériné après l’adoption par vote d’un amendement maintenant deux références à la Cour pénale internationale (CPI), l’Assemblée condamne dans les termes les plus énergiques l’augmentation alarmante du nombre de menaces pesant sur ces personnels et du nombre d’actes terroristes et d’attaques contre les convois humanitaires.

En présentant la résolution, l’Union européenne avait souligné qu’il s’agit de reconnaître les menaces diverses et multidimensionnelles auxquelles sont exposés les femmes et les hommes du personnel humanitaire, y compris les ONG, le personnel médical, le personnel des Nations Unies et le personnel associé.  Pour cette raison, la résolution souligne l’importance qu’il y a à ce que la sécurité et la sûreté des personnels humanitaires et de l’ONU soient systématiquement et intégralement prises en compte dans la planification de l’action humanitaire.  

La résolution encourage et appuie tous les efforts visant à renforcer les partenariats et les échanges d’informations avec les ONG et souligne la vulnérabilité du personnel local et l’augmentation du nombre des attaques sexuelles.  La résolution salue aussi les améliorations apportées au système de gestion de la sécurité aux Nations Unies.

Quant à la résolution sur la coopération internationale en matière d’aide humanitaire, à la suite de catastrophes naturelles***, l’Équateur, au nom du Groupe des 77 et de la Chine, expliquait, vendredi dernier, que cette année, la résolution reconnaît l’importance croissante et l’ampleur des catastrophes naturelles, y compris celles dues aux changements climatiques.  

La résolution met une emphase particulière sur la prévention et l’atténuation des catastrophes, ainsi que sur l’état de préparation et les systèmes d’alerte précoce.  Elle invite les États Membres, les organisations internationales et autres à améliorer leur capacité d’intervention sur la base des informations provenant des systèmes d’alerte rapide et les encourage à continuer d’aider à adapter la préparation et l’intervention en cas de catastrophe aux conditions locales et à faire en sorte que les intervenants nationaux et locaux aient les moyens de répondre aux besoins et aux priorités locaux.

La résolution encourage aussi les États Membres, appuyés par l’Organisation des Nations Unies s’ils en font la demande, à œuvrer à la création et au renforcement de bases de données nationales sur les pertes dues aux catastrophes, de profils de risque et de capacités, et à continuer de recueillir, de mettre en commun et d’utiliser les données recueillies afin d’éclairer les mesures et les stratégies pertinentes.

S’agissant de « l’assistance au peuple palestinien »****, l’Assemblée prie les États Membres, les institutions financières internationales du système des Nations Unies, les organisations intergouvernementales et non gouvernementales, et les organisations régionales et interrégionales d’apporter, aussi rapidement et généreusement que possible une assistance économique et sociale au peuple palestinien.

Aujourd’hui, l’Observateur permanent de l’État de Palestine a axé son intervention sur les efforts consentis par le Gouvernement palestinien « menacés par l’occupation israélienne » pour la réalisation des objectifs de développement durable pour son peuple.  Ces efforts reposent sur « Le Citoyen d’abord », Plan de mise en œuvre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030, pour la période 2017-2022 dont les trois piliers sont l’indépendance, la réforme de la gouvernance et le développement durable.

L’Assemblée générale a aussi adopté sans vote deux autres résolutions sur la « culture de paix ».  Le premier, sur la promotion du dialogue, de l’entente et de la coopération entre les religions et les cultures au service de la paix*****, salue le rôle de chef de file de l’UNESCO dans le domaine du dialogue interculturel et la contribution qu’elle apporte au dialogue interreligieux.  L’Assemblée y invite les États Membres et les organisations intergouvernementales et non gouvernementales compétentes à continuer d’envisager d’organiser des activités à l’appui du Plan d’action pour la Décennie internationale du rapprochement des cultures (2013-2022) de l’UNESCO.

S’agissant de la suite donnée à la Déclaration et au Programme d’action en faveur d’une culture de paix******, adoptés le 13 septembre 1999, l’Assemblée se félicite que la promotion d’une culture de paix soit prévue dans le Programme 2030.  Elle prie à nouveau son Président d’envisager d’organiser un forum de haut niveau sur la mise en œuvre du Programme d’action lequel se tiendrait à l’occasion de l’anniversaire de son adoption, le ou vers le 13 septembre.  Elle invite en outre le Secrétaire général à lancer une campagne de communication visant à faire mieux connaître le Programme d’action et ses huit domaines d’intervention.

L’Assemblée a en outre approuvé le rapport de la Commission de vérification des pouvoirs, élu 20 membres du Comité du programme et de la coordination; et reporté la nomination de sept membres du Comité des conférences*******.

L’Assemblée poursuivra ses travaux demain à 10 heures pour examiner les questions relatives à la « santé mondiale et politique étrangère » et se prononcer sur deux projets de résolution.

**Déclarations**

M. ABDULLAH ABU SHAWESH, Observateur de l’État de Palestine, a attiré l’attention sur « Le Citoyen d’abord », Plan de mise en œuvre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030, pour la période 2017-2022.  Lancé le 1er janvier 2016, après consultations avec tous les segments de la société et les partenaires internationaux, le Plan repose sur trois piliers, à savoir l’indépendance, la réforme de la gouvernance et le développement durable.  Mais, a prévenu l’Observateur, pour que les Palestiniens puissent atteindre les objectifs fixés, l’occupation israélienne doit cesser.  Insistant sur les défis mondiaux comme les répercussions des changements climatiques, l’Observateur a appelé à une planification adéquate et à la mobilisation des fonds.  Les efforts du Gouvernement palestinien en ce sens sont menacés par l’occupation israélienne, a répété l’Observateur. 

M. SPOERRI, Comité international de la Croix Rouge (CICR), a déclaré que la « simplicité de l’approche » initiée par le Secrétaire général dans son plan de réforme des Nations Unies est « rafraîchissante » et signifie que toutes les agences du système doivent s’unir pour parvenir à des résultats collectifs.  Il s’est aussi réjoui que 2017 aura marqué des pas diplomatiques importants, en ce qui concerne un pacte mondial pour les migrations et un autre pour les réfugiés, deux domaines dans lesquels intervient le CICR.  Cette année aura également marqué, à la fois, le quarantième anniversaire des Protocoles additionnels aux Conventions de Genève et le vingtième des Principes directeurs relatifs au déplacement de personnes à l’intérieur de leur propre pays, deux instruments clefs dans la protection des plus vulnérables en cas de conflit.  Elle aura aussi été une année significative pour la lutte antiterroriste, avec de nouvelles approches au plan international.  Dans ce contexte, il est à espérer que 2018 consolidera la réforme du Secrétaire général, a dit le représentant, anticipant toutefois que l’année 2018 sera exigeante pour l’action humanitaire.

S’agissant de la réforme voulue par le Secrétaire général, le CICR, en tant qu’organisation intervenant sur les questions et les situations humanitaires, comprend l’importance des connections entre action humanitaire, développement et paix, en particulier dans les situations de conflit.  Il constate cependant qu’il y a des lacunes dans la politique des Nations Unies et parmi elles, la « protection ».  La politique actuelle de l’ONU, s’est expliqué le représentant, s’appuie trop sur le développement et la paix sans reconnaître que la protection est essentielle aux deux.  La protection des civils est en effet la condition préalable du développement et de la paix.  Si les gens sont attaqués, contraints de fuir, pillés, appauvris, assiégés, détenus ou trop effrayés pour aller à l’hôpital ou à l’école, comment peuvent-ils atteindre le développement ou la paix ?  « La protection est indivisible du développement et de la paix ». 

Le CICR relève aussi des lacunes dans la neutralité, l’impartialité et l’indépendance de l’action humanitaire alors qu’il est primordial que des organisations impartiales comme le CICR puissent travailler avec toutes les parties prenantes d’un conflit et atteindre les personnes qui ont besoin d’aide, a-t-il dit. 

C’est pourquoi, le CICR lance un appel aux États afin qu’ils s’assurent que la question de la protection et de l’impartialité de l’action humanitaire soit intégrée aux politiques sur les conflits armés et la violence.  Le CICR juge primordial que les lois pénales contre le terrorisme ne s’applique en aucun cas « aux activités exclusivement humanitaires et impartiales ».

Mme ANNE CHRISTENSEN, Fédération internationale des Sociétés de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (FICR), a souligné que l’un des défis les plus importants de notre temps est les changements climatiques.  Plus de 90% des catastrophes naturelles sont désormais liées au climat.  Nous savons ce qu’il faut faire et notamment réduire les risques et améliorer la résilience.  La réduction des risques nécessitera, a prévenu la représentante, des investissements accrus dans l’action locale et des efforts plus robustes pour veiller à ce que ceux qui souffrent le plus ne soient laissés de côté.  Pour voir de vrais changements et de réels progrès, il faudra resserrer les liens entre la science, les politiques, la prise de décisions et l’action sur le terrain et par exemple, trouver les moyens de s’attaquer aux phénomènes climatiques extrêmes grâce à des systèmes d’alerte rapide qui « alertent » même les communautés les plus vulnérables et leur permettent de réagir.

La Fédération a par exemple mis au point une nouvelle méthode de pré-positionnement financier fondé sur les prévisions météo.  Ainsi, un jour avant que le cyclone ne frappe le Bangladesh, la Croix-Rouge bangladaise avait déjà distribué à près de 2 300 ménages un don de 60 euros pour qu’ils se préparent à la catastrophe naturelle.  Pour 2018, la Fédération a créé une nouvelle « fenêtre financière » fondée sur la météo dans son Fonds pour les secours d’urgence en cas de catastrophe.  La représentante a conclu en rappelant que cette année marque le dixième anniversaire des « Lignes directrices relatives à la facilitation et à la réglementation nationales des opérations internationales de secours et d’assistance au relèvement initial en cas de catastrophe ».  Le mois dernier, la Fédération a adopté « l’Appel à l’action sur les besoins humanitaires des migrants vulnérables » qui insiste sur certaines questions « fondamentales » apparemment écartées du débat sur le pacte mondial pour les migrations, dont l’extrême vulnérabilité des migrants clandestins, tant dans les pays de transit que dans les pays de destination. 

Adoption des projets de résolution

À la demande du Soudan, l’alinéa 28 et le paragraphe 7 de la résolution sur la « sûreté et sécurité du personnel humanitaire et protection du personnel des Nations Unies » (A/72/L.22), a été soumis aux voix et adopté par 95 voix pour, 12 voix contre et 17 abstentions. 

L’alinéa 28 se lit comme suit: « rappelant que les attaques délibérées contre le personnel participant à une mission d’aide humanitaire ou de maintien de la paix établie en vertu de la Charte des Nations Unies, dans la mesure où celui-ci peut se prévaloir de la protection accordée aux civils ou aux biens de caractère civil au titre du droit international des conflits armés, sont considérées comme des crimes de guerre au regard du Statut de Rome de la Cour pénale internationale, et notant le rôle que peut jouer la Cour pénale internationale, le cas échéant, dans le jugement des responsables de violations graves du droit international humanitaire ».

Le paragraphe 7 prévoit que l’Assemblée générale « engage également tous les États à envisager de devenir parties au Statut de Rome de la Cour pénale internationale ».

Au nom de plusieurs pays, le Canada a douté de la pertinence de ce vote séparé compte tenu des attaques croissantes et directes contre le personnel de l’ONU lesquelles peuvent constituer des crimes de guerre.  La résolution parle des faits et de rien d’autre, a-t-il tranché, arguant que la Cour pénale internationale (CPI) peut se saisir de situations que les tribunaux nationaux ne peuvent ou ne veulent pas traiter.

C’est la deuxième année consécutive qu’un vote séparé est demandé, a commenté la Fédération de Russie, qui a rappelé qu’elle a été à l’initiative de la création des tribunaux de Nuremberg et de Tokyo, prenant part à l’élaboration de documents fondamentaux.  Mais aujourd’hui, les choses sont différentes, a-t-elle estimé, car la CPI « ne répond pas aux espoirs qu’elle avait suscités et n’a pas réussi à se convertir en un organe impartial et efficace ».  Son inefficacité a d’ailleurs été avérée lors des enquêtes qu’elle a lancées, a insisté la Fédération de Russie qui a voté contre l’alinéa et le paragraphe.

Au nom de l’Union européenne, les Pays-Bas ont regretté la mise aux voix.  Les violations massives du droit international humanitaire et des droits de l’homme montrent bien à quel point il est indispensable que la CPI complète le travail des juridictions nationales.  La CPI a rendu à des milliers de victimes de crimes atroces l’espoir que justice peut être faite.  La paix et la justice sont complémentaires, ont insisté les Pays-Bas. 

Le Soudan a maintenu ses réserves sur la mention de la CPI et d’autres résolutions visant à exercer des pressions « inacceptables » sur certains États Membres.  La Cour, a-t-il argué, n’est pas un organe des Nations Unies en dépit des vaines tentatives pour prouver le contraire.  Le Statut de Rome a outre dit le représentant, est « incompatible » avec d’autres traités internationaux dont la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des traités.  Depuis 2002, a-t-il encore dénoncé, la pratique de la Cour s’est écartée des notions de justice et de paix.  La CPI est devenue « un obstacle à la paix » au Darfour et à la stabilité au Soudan, en Afrique et ailleurs.  Rappelant les scandales et les affaires de corruption qui entachent désormais la Cour, le Soudan a dit ne pas voir comment la CPI serait indépendante alors que la moitié de son budget vient des contributions volontaires des États et des ONG qui, en échange, exercent leur contrôle.

Israël a dit voir dans la résolution la confirmation du rôle unique que jouent les Nations Unies dans l’action humanitaire.  Mais il a pris la parole pour insister sur son attachement aux règles de procédure qui n’ont pas tout à fait été respectées.

Le projet de résolution sur la « Coopération internationale en matière d’aide humanitaire à la suite de catastrophes naturelles: de la phase des secours à celle de l’aide au développement » (A/72/L.23) a été adopté sans vote, de même que ceux sur « le renforcement de la coordination de l’aide humanitaire d’urgence et des secours fournis par des organismes des Nations Unies » (A/72/L.24) et sur l’« assistance au peuple palestinien » (A/72/L.25).

Réitérant une nouvelle fois son attachement aux règles de procédure, Israël a douté du droit de l’État de Palestine à se porter coauteur d’une résolution.  Toute violation de ces règles ne peut que porter préjudice aux décisions de l’Assemblée générale, a-t-il prévenu. 

Le Saint-Siège a remercié les facilitateurs de la résolution sur le renforcement de la coordination de l’aide humanitaire et salué l’esprit positif qui a caractérisé les négociations sur les dispositions liées aux migrants.  Il a cependant émis des réserves sur certains concepts, précisant que l’avortement ne devrait pas faire partie de la santé reproductive.  Il a aussi émis une réserve sur la définition du terme « genre ». 

RAPPORT DE LA COMMISSION DE VERIFICATION DES POUVOIRS (A/72/601)

Le rapport a été présenté par la Présidente de la Commission de vérification des pouvoirs, Mme GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Irlande).

Après que l’Assemblée l’eut approuvé, la République islamique d’Iran a émis des réserves quant aux parties du rapport qui pourraient constituer une reconnaissance du régime israélien.  L’Indonésie a attiré l’attention sur les actes « peu amicaux » des Vanuatu à la session de l’Assemblée générale, dont le soutien apporté aux mouvements séparatistes de Papouasie occidentale où les dissidents ont pourtant des intentions « malveillantes ».  Rappelant que la Charte des Nations Unies et les différentes résolutions démontrent clairement l’importance de l’amitié entre États et l’inviolabilité de leur territoire, l’Indonésie a estimé que la présence de certaines personnes dans la délégation des Vanuatu est une attaque contre sa souveraineté.  Elle a exigé des explications.

**CULTURE DE PAIX**

**Adoption des projets de résolution**

Présentant le projet de résolution sur la promotion du dialogue, de l’entente et de la coopération entre les religions et les cultures au service de la paix (A/72/L.29) qui a été adopté sans vote, les Philippines, également au nom du Pakistan, ont souligné que ce texte a recueilli l’appui de beaucoup de pays de la région d’Asie-Pacifique, d’Afrique, des Amériques et d’Europe, après des consultations « ouvertes ».  Cette année, la résolution a deux objectifs: promouvoir le dialogue interreligieux et interculturel en faveur de la paix et de la stabilité, comme la voie la plus prometteuse vers la réalisation du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030; et renforcer les mécanismes et prendre les mesures appropriées en faveur d’une promotion sincère d’un dialogue constructif entre les religions et les cultures pour favoriser le respect mutuel et la tolérance en dépit des différences.  Les Philippines ont dénoncé la montée et l’exploitation par les groupes terroristes de la xénophobie, de l’intolérance religieuse et de l’extrémisme dans toutes les régions.  Ils ont voulu que l’on continue de renforcer les valeurs communes pour aboutir à une culture mondiale de la paix.  Les Philippines ont ensuite apporté deux amendements oraux à l’alinéa 23 du préambule.

S’agissant de la résolution intitulée « suite donnée à la Déclaration et au Programme d’action et au Programme d’action en faveur d’une culture de paix (A/72/L.30) également adoptée sans vote, le Bangladesh a déclaré que toute l’humanité aspire à la culture de paix.  La propagation doit être au cœur de la gestion créative des différends et tensions.  Il a rappelé que le Bangladesh est, depuis 18 ans maintenant, facilitateur de cette résolution « fondamentale » et que le Premier Ministre, Cheikh Hasina, est personnellement attaché à cette question.  Le Bangladesh a dégagé quatre nouveaux éléments dans le texte soumis cette année et d’abord, la reconnaissance de la manifestation de haut niveau du 7 septembre dernier sur le Programme d’action, qui était axée sur la petite enfance.  Le texte rappelle aussi la résolution 70/262 sur l’examen de l’architecture de la consolidation de la paix à l’ONU qui a introduit la notion de « pérennisation de la paix » et qui a souligné que les efforts dans ce sens doivent prendre en compte la promotion de la culture de paix.

Troisièmement, la résolution prend note de la création du Bureau des Nations Unies contre le terrorisme et quatrièmement, elle reconnaît le travail de l’Alliance des civilisations en faveur de la culture de paix.  Le texte mentionne également la manifestation du 22 septembre dernier sur l’engagement de la jeunesse.  La résolution demande, à nouveau, l’organisation d’un forum de haut niveau sur la mise en œuvre du Programme d’action.

L’Arménie a tenu à dénoncé les pays qui ont pris l’habitude d’abuser de certains forums internationaux pour diffuser leur propagande, notamment l’Azerbaïdjan.  Elle l’a accusé de violer les droits de l’homme et de détruire des éléments de patrimoine culturel et religieux, notamment des croix arméniennes.

Se disant déterminés à encourager une culture de paix et à rejeter la violence, les États-Unis ont appuyé tous les efforts visant à favoriser le dialogue entre les cultures et les religions.  S’ils ont reconnu le Programme 2030, ils ont néanmoins souligné que chaque pays a ses propres priorités en matière de développement.  Ils se sont également dits préoccupés par des « politiques de modération », qui restent à définir, et ont insisté sur le respect des droits de l’homme, y compris la liberté d’expression.

Le Canada a dit comprendre que les interventions qui participent de la « modération » visant à aider les communautés à renforcer leur résilience à l’extrémisme.  C’est un équilibre « délicat » mais le Canada est déterminé à s’y employer avec tous ses partenaires. 

Commentant la résolution sur le Programme d’action en faveur d’une culture de paix, le Brésil a noté que c’est la première fois qu’un document négocié inclut le concept de « pérennisation de la paix ».  Il a voulu que l’on évite tout chevauchement dans la mise en œuvre des textes agréés, insistant sur le lien entre culture de paix et développement.

Se félicitant également de la résolution sur le Programme d’action, El Salvador a estimé que la préservation et la promotion de la mémoire historique sont décisives pour ancrer la tolérante et l’harmonie dans les sociétés.  Il a jugé important que la résolution souligne l’accent à placer sur la petite enfance pour développer des sociétés plus pacifiques.  El Salvador a aussi relevé le rôle important que jouent les femmes dans la prévention et le règlement de conflits et dans la consolidation de la paix.  Quelque 25 ans après l’accord de paix, El Salvador est conscient que le règlement de la question politique ne suffit pas.  Il faut aussi régler la question socioéconomique.  Le pays y travaille, avec le soutien de l’ONU, convaincu de l’importance d’institutions fortes, du libre accès à l’information et de la redevabilité gouvernementale.  C’est la raison pour laquelle, El Salvador s’est doté d’un « Secrétariat d’État de la transparence active » pour galvaniser la lutte contre la corruption sous toutes ses formes.  La paix n’est pas seulement l’absence de guerre ou de violence.  Sa réalisation doit impliquer tous les segments de la société.

**Droit de réponse**

L’Azerbaïdjan a reproché à l’Arménie de tenter, une fois de plus, de politiser les objectifs de la culture de paix qu’elle ne comprend décidément pas. Dans sa déclaration du 16 octobre 2017, a rappelé l’Azerbaïdjan, le Secrétaire général a voulu que l’on s’appuie sur les conclusions du Sommet de Genève pour régler le différend entre l’Arménie et l’Azerbaïdjan.  Mais, la semaine dernière à Vienne, l’Arménie a encore rendu « illusoire » tout espoir de solution, sans oublier la poursuite de sa politique de nettoyage ethnique dans les territoires occupés, y compris au Nagorno-Karabakh.  L’Azerbaïdjan a cité la liste « non exhaustive » des exactions de l’Arménie.",268,"French"
2370124,"La jeunesse placée au cœur de la célébration de la journée des droits de l’homme en RCA Pour la 70eme journée anniversaire de l’adoption de la déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme, le ministère de la justice et le réseau des ONG de promotion et de défense des droits de l’homme ont marqué solennellement l’évènement, avec l’appui de la division des droits de l’homme de la MINUSCA, lors d’une cérémonie officielle tenue le  11 décembre 2017 à Bangui.   

Pour l’occasion, de nombreux élèves, étudiants, activistes des droits de l’homme se sont joints au représentant du ministre de la justice et des droits de l’homme, Firmin Ngbeng Moukoue, au coordonnateur adjoint du réseau des ONG de promotion et défense des droits de l’homme, Célestin N’zala, au directeur de la division des affaires politiques de la MINUSCA, Ray Virgilio Torres Flores, et au directeur de la division des droits de l’homme, Musa Gassama, pour **« élargir l’horizon des jeunes sur la problématique des droits de l’homme en lien surtout avec les acteurs associatifs et institutionnels », comme le souligne** Célestin N’zala. 

En effet, dira-t-il dans son allocution de la circonstance, **« la journée du 10 décembre est surtout une journée de sensibilisation à l’endroit de la jeunesse car l’éducation aux droits de l’homme contribue de manière essentielle à prévenir des conflits ». **

L’assistance a aussi pris connaissance du message du Secrétaire général de l’ONU, Antonio Guterres, lequel rappelle entre autres que _« __nous avons tous le droit de nous exprimer librement et d’être associés aux décisions qui nous concernent. Nous avons tous le droit de ne subir aucune forme de discrimination _». Un message délivré par le  directeur de la division des affaires politiques de la MINUSCA qui a aussi souligné que le moment a été opportun pour renouveler une fois de plus **« l’engagement de la MINUSCA à mobiliser tous les efforts pour apporter une réponse aux violations des droits de l’homme qui sont commises en Centrafrique et qui continuent d’être documentées ». **

Au nom du ministre de la Justice, le chargé de mission au ministère de la justice et des droits de l’homme Firmin Ngbeng Moukoue a salué le concours de la communauté internationale à travers la MINUSCA, car **« cet atout non-négligeable a été traduit par la mise en place de la Cour pénale spéciale qui demeure une importante avancée pour la promotion et la défense des droits de l’homme en Centrafrique ». I**l a surtout souligné l’importance des droits de l’homme dans le développement. 

Une préoccupation qui est aussi l’avis d’Elvis Magama, un étudiant en droit présent à la cérémonie. **_« On ne peut concevoir le développement sans le respect des droits de l’homme. Et il est important de souligner que c’est le mépris des droits de l’homme qui a mis notre pays dans cette situation que nous vivons. Pour sortir définitivement des spirales de violences, il est important pour la jeunesse de s’inscrire dès maintenant dans le respect des droits de l’homme »._**

Ponctuée**_ _**de sketchs, la cérémonie était terminée dans une ambiance où les messages ont été transmis avec succès, comme le souligne Elvis Magama : **_« Nous espérons qu’à partir d’aujourd’hui les droits de l’homme ne seront pas de vains mots ».  _**

Notons qu’en prélude de cette cérémonie officielle une conférence-débat et des manifestations culturelles ont aussi organisées autour des questions de droits de l’homme de même qu’une marche pacifique pour rappeler leur importance. Diverses activités commémoratives ont aussi eu lieu à travers les autres régions du pays.",268,"French"
2369784,"Burkina Faso. La torture, les violences commises par des milices et les mariages précoces dominent les inquiétudes en matière de droits humains à l’approche de l’examen de l’ONU Les autorités du Burkina Faso doivent trouver une solution aux violences commises par des groupes d’autodéfense, ouvrir une enquête sur des actes de torture présumés commis par la police et protéger les femmes et les filles exposées à des risques de mariage précoce, a déclaré Amnesty International le 8 décembre dans sa communication présentée à l’occasion de l’Examen périodique universel du pays.

Le rapport sur l’EPU, intitulé [Burkina Faso. Un chemin difficile vers le respect des droits humains](https://www.amnesty.org/fr/documents/afr60/7367/2017/fr/), évalue le cadre de protection des droits humains du pays et appelle le gouvernement à mettre un terme à l’impunité massive pour les violations des droits humains.

« Que ce soit en ce qui concerne la torture en garde à vue ou les homicides de manifestants, nos recherches démontrent que le Burkina Faso a encore beaucoup à faire pour mettre un terme à l’impunité », a déclaré Gaetan Mootoo, chercheur sur l’Afrique de l’Ouest à Amnesty International.

« Si le gouvernement veut faire clairement savoir qu’il est déterminé à assurer un meilleur respect des droits humains au Burkina Faso, ces problèmes doivent être réglés immédiatement. »

**Groupes d’autodéfense opérant dans l’illégalité**

Connus localement sous le nom de « kogleweogo », des groupes d’autodéfense se sont formés dans de nombreuses régions rurales en réaction à l’insécurité grandissante dans certaines parties du pays. Cette année, ces groupes ont continué de commettre des exactions, notamment des homicides illégaux et des traitements inhumains, bien qu’un décret réglementant la police de proximité ait été adopté en décembre 2016.

En janvier, des groupes d’autodéfense ont torturé à mort un homme soupçonné d’avoir volé un poulet. En mai, six personnes, dont deux civils, ont été tuées dans un affrontement entre des « kogleweogo » et des habitants de la région du Centre-Ouest du pays. Ces deux dernières années, des groupes d’autodéfense ont entravé la justice dans le but de protéger leurs membres et ont empêché la tenue de procès dans au moins deux villes. En 2016 et 2017, seuls deux membres de ces groupes ont été inculpés pour des homicides, ce qui représente une très petite part des graves atteintes aux droits humains commises.

**Des dizaines de détenus torturés en garde à vue**

Lors de l’EPU précédant, le Burkina Faso avait affirmé qu’aucun acte de torture ou d’autres mauvais traitements n’était commis dans le pays. Cependant, au cours des trois dernières années, Amnesty International a recueilli les témoignages de plus de 40 détenus affirmant avoir été victimes d’actes de torture et d’autres mauvais traitements aux mains de la police, généralement au moment de l’arrestation ou pendant la garde à vue.

Un homme a déclaré avoir été torturé tous les jours pendant un mois. D’autres ont indiqué qu’on les avait frappés pour leur extorquer des aveux, et certains ont été détenus pendant 36 jours avant d’être inculpés.

**Les conséquences néfastes des mariages précoces et forcés**

Lors de l’Examen périodique universel de 2013, le Burkina Faso avait accepté sept recommandations l’invitant à mettre un terme aux mariages précoces et forcés. Cependant, le nombre de mariages précoces et forcés dans le pays est toujours parmi les plus élevés du monde.

Au cours des trois dernières années, des dizaines de femmes et de jeunes filles ont déclaré à Amnesty International subir un mariage forcé et précoce, y compris une adolescente de 13 ans qui a parcouru 160 km à pied en trois jours pour échapper à un mariage arrangé par son père avec un homme de 70 ans qui avait déjà cinq épouses.

Les mariages précoces et forcés ont des conséquences néfastes pour la santé, la vie et l’accès à l’emploi et à l’éducation des femmes et des filles, et les gouvernements sont tenus de les interdire et de les empêcher au titre du droit international. En février 2016, le gouvernement du Burkina Faso s’est engagé à augmenter l’âge légal du mariage pour les filles à 18 ans, mais cela n’a toujours pas été fait.

« Les autorités se sont publiquement engagées l’année dernière à faire de la fin des mariages précoces et forcés une priorité pour le nouveau gouvernement. Il est maintenant temps de passer des paroles aux actes en modifiant le Code de la famille et inscrivant leur engagement dans la loi », a déclaré Gaetan Mootoo.

« Les autorités doivent faire davantage de progrès clairs en menant des campagnes d’information et d’éducation destinées à sensibiliser au préjudice que subissent les victimes de mariages précoces et forcés et au coût pour la société », a déclaré Gaetan Mootoo.

**Mortalité maternelle et violences contre les femmes**

En dépit de la suppression des obstacles financiers à l’accès aux services de santé maternelle en mars 2016, les dernières données disponibles dénombrent 371 décès maternels pour 100 000 naissances au Burkina Faso, et au moins 2 700 femmes meurent en accouchant chaque année.

Lors d’un entretien avec un professionnel de santé en juin 2017, Amnesty International a été informée d’au moins 100 décès maternels dans les cinq mois précédents dans l’un des deux principaux hôpitaux de Ouagadougou, la capitale.

L’EPU précédent avait également soulevé des inquiétudes quant aux violences faites aux femmes au Burkina Faso et les autorités avaient accepté huit recommandations invitant le pays à adopter des lois permettant d’y mettre fin. En septembre 2015, une loi pour la prévention, la sanction et l’octroi de réparations pour les violences contre les femmes et les filles, ainsi que pour l’aide aux victimes a été adoptée. Cette loi prévoit notamment des mesures visant à créer des centres pour les femmes victimes de violences dans lesquels est proposée une aide juridique, psychologique et médicale. Cependant, à ce jour, un seul centre a été ouvert. 

**Complément d’information**

Le bilan du Burkina Faso en matière de droits humains avait été évalué pour la dernière fois en avril 2013, et 138 recommandations avaient été acceptées. Parmi ces recommandations figuraient l’interdiction des mariages précoces et forcés et l’adoption de lois spécifiques destinées à lutter contre les violences faites aux femmes.

Un projet de nouvelle Constitution a été déposé pour approbation. Il prévoit plusieurs articles qui renforceraient la protection des droits humains dans le pays, notamment l’abolition de la peine de mort. Le 31 décembre 2016, 12 personnes se trouvaient sous le coup d’une peine de mort dans le pays.",268,"French"

**A. Rappel du contexte et justification de l’intervention**

Depuis mai 2017, les populations de la ville de Niem, située dans la commune d’élevage de Niem-Yéléwa, sont victimes de traumatismes constants liés soit à des menaces d’attaque, soit à des attaques effectives, occasionnant à chaque fois des mouvements de populations. A la fin du mois d’août et jusqu’à début septembre, une succession d’attaques (à Niem, Service Kolo, Vakap, Sanguéré 3) et de combats entre groupes armés a occasionné une fois de plus un déplacement massif des populations de Niem et environs vers Bouar, Koui et sur l’axe BouarGaroua Boulaï.  

Depuis la mi-novembre, les populations ont commencé à retourner à Niem pour des raisons de difficultés rencontrées dans leur lieu de refuge mais aussi suite à l’engagement pacifique de quelques autorités locales retournées et groupe armé in situ. Conformément à son mandat d’intervenir auprès des populations retournées et rapatriées, une équipe RRM-ACF s’était déployée dans la zone de retour du 15 au 17/11/2017 pour une évaluation multisectorielle (MSA) permettant d’évaluer les besoins des populations civiles retournées et rapatriées. 
 
La MSA réalisée a révélé les vulnérabilités de ces populations dans divers secteurs dont un score NFI global de 4,3, score largement supérieur au seuil d’intervention RMM de 3,9 et une situation très inquiétante en Eau Hygiène et Assainissement.  

C’est ainsi que l’équipe RRM – ACF a proposé d’organiser une mission d’intervention NFI/WASH avec distribution de kits complets d’Articles ménagers essentiels et intervention WASH par la remise en service d’une pompe ainsi que la redynamisation des comités de gestion point d’eau (CPE) et du comité d’hygiène du centre de santé déjà existants.  

Suite à la validation de cette intervention l’équipe d’intervention RRM-ACF s’est rendue dans la zone du 23 au 28 novembre 2017.

**B. Présentation de la zone d’intervention** 

La ville de Niem est une localité de la commune de Niem-Yelewa se trouvant à 60 km au nord-ouest de Bouar, sa sous-préfecture. Elle compte 24 quartiers dont la plupart commencent à être réinvestis par la population suite au retour progressif des populations en fuite.",268,"French"

Les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux, en droits et en dignité. C'est le principe fondamental consacré par la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme de 1948.

Cet idéal est aussi pertinent et aussi pressant aujourd'hui qu'il y a près de soixante-dix ans, lorsque les nations ont émergé de l'ombre de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et ont promis ensemble de protéger les droits et la dignité de tous les peuples.

Près de 70 ans plus tard, ces droits demeurent la pierre angulaire de la mission et du mandat des Nations Unies. Aujourd’hui encore, ils sont menacés dans de nombreux endroits du monde. Aujourd’hui encore, les protéger requiert notre attention et notre vigilance.

Pour la communauté du développement, les droits de l'homme sont la base sur laquelle notre travail se construit.

Lorsque nous aidons les plus pauvres et les plus vulnérables, lorsque nous aidons les gouvernements à construire des institutions fortes, justes et inclusives, lorsque nous soutenons la fourniture de services et d'infrastructures essentiels, nous aidons à mettre en place les conditions nécessaires pour que les gens puissent vivre des vies de dignité et d'opportunité.

Alors que nous nous préparons à célébrer le 70e anniversaire de la Déclaration en 2018, concentrons-nous sur l'esprit qu'il incarne.

Rappelons-nous aussi que la Déclaration est beaucoup plus qu'un noble idéalisme. Les droits qu'il consacre protègent les individus, les communautés et, en fin de compte, le respect et la cohésion sociale qui nous unissent.

Avec les objectifs de développement durable et le Programme 2030, les droits de l'homme ouvrent la voie vers un monde sans discrimination ni exclusion, un monde de paix et de prospérité durable, un monde où personne n'est laissé pour compte.",268,"French"

Situé à 375 Km de Bangui et chef-lieu de l’Ouham Pendé, à 6°19’02’’ de latitude Nord et 16°22’42’’ de longitude Est, la ville de Bozoum a accueilli des déplacés de Bocaranga suite à l’attaque de la ville le 23 septembre 2017. Si la plupart des déplacés ont trouvé refuge dans des familles d’accueil ; plus de 620 se sont installés sur trois sites (Croix Rouge, Brigade de recherche et Ecole mixte 1) selon le recensement lors de la MSA.  

Plusieurs interventions dans les domaines de la santé, NFI et vivres menés par des acteurs humanitaires (Caritas, HCR) ont permis d’assister les déplacés mais, dans le domaine de l’Eau, l’Hygiène et l’Assainissement (EHA) il n’y avait pas encore eu d’action. C’est dans ce cadre qu’Action contre la Faim a mené une évaluation sectorielle EHA conduite par l’équipe RRM. L’équipe Forages mobiles (projet financé par ECHO) a également évalué la zone, conjointement, du 16 au 20 octobre 2017.  

Cette évaluation a révélé des vulnérabilités au niveau de l’accès à l’eau (57% des ménages s’approvisionnent auprès de puits non aménagés), de mauvaises conditions d’hygiène et d’assainissement (seulement 13% des IDPs disposent de savon ou cendre pour le lavage de mains, 0% des IDPs dispose de latrines acceptables).",268,"French"

Le suivi des flux de population (FMP) est une activité qui permet de quantifier et de qualifier les flux, les profils des migrants, les tendances et les routes migratoires sur un point d’entrée, de transit ou de sortie donné. En Guinée, quatre (4) points de suivi ont été installés depuis fin mars 2017 dans les localités frontalières avec Mali. Il s’agit des localités de Kouremalé, Nafadji, Balandougouba et Niantanina où l’on observe les mouvements des voyageurs en transit. Durant cette période la proportion des mineurs observés sur l’ensemble des points de suivi des flux a légèrement augmenté de 1% par rapport au mois dernier, soit 8%. Cette infographie est un résumé des données collectées par le point de suivi de Balandougouba pour la période du mois de août 2017. Ce point a enregistré 15% des individus observés dans les points de suivi des flux en Guinée, avec une majorité d’hommes voyageant principalement à bord des moto-triporteurs et des mini bus.

Parmi les individus observés qui arrivent à Balandougouba, la plupart viennent de Mandiana.
Ces individus se dirigent essentiellement vers le Mali, et la Côte d’ivoire. D’autres destinations sont évoquées, mais à faible taux.
Au cours de ce mois, les Guinéens et les Maliens constituent la majorité des migrants suivis des Nigériens. Les étrangers constituant plus de 56% sont des migrants en provenance des sites miniers de la préfecture de Mandiana.

**Téléchargez des photos, vidéos et un exemplaire du rapport** : http://uni.cf/2j2GvHC

**NEW YORK, le 11 décembre 2017** – Bien que les enfants soient très présents sur Internet – un internaute sur trois dans le monde est un enfant – les mesures prises pour les protéger des périls du monde numérique et accroître leur accès à un contenu en ligne sûr sont bien trop rares, affirme l'UNICEF dans son rapport annuel phare publié ce jour.

Le rapport de l’UNICEF La situation des enfants dans le monde 2017 : Les enfants dans un monde numérique analyse pour la première fois de manière exhaustive la manière dont la technologie numérique affecte la vie des enfants et les possibilités qui s'offrent à eux, identifiant à la fois les dangers et les opportunités. Il souligne que les gouvernements et le secteur privé ne se sont pas adaptés au rythme des changements, exposant ainsi les enfants à de nouveaux risques et dangers et laissant de côté des millions d'enfants parmi les plus défavorisés. 

« Qu’elle soit utilisée à bon ou à mauvais escient, la technologie numérique fait désormais partie intégrante de nos vies, et ce, de manière irréversible », confie Anthony Lake, Directeur général de l’UNICEF. « Dans un monde numérique, notre double défi est d'atténuer les effets nocifs et d’optimiser les avantages d'Internet pour chaque enfant. »

Le rapport explore les avantages que peut offrir la technologie numérique aux enfants les plus défavorisés, et plus particulièrement à ceux qui grandissent dans la pauvreté ou sont touchés par des crises humanitaires : meilleur accès à l'information, développement de compétences utiles dans un environnement de travail numérique et offre d'une plateforme leur permettant d'échanger en ligne et de faire connaître leurs points de vue.

Le rapport montre néanmoins que des millions d’enfants sont laissés pour compte. Dans le monde, environ un tiers des jeunes – soit 346 millions de personnes – ne sont pas connectés, ce qui accentue les inégalités et réduit la capacité des enfants à prendre part à une économie de plus en plus numérique.

Le rapport souligne, par ailleurs, qu'Internet accroît la vulnérabilité des enfants aux risques et dangers : utilisation de leurs informations personnelles à mauvais escient, accès à des contenus nuisibles et intimidation en ligne, notamment. Car, comme l’indique le rapport, avec l'omniprésence des dispositifs mobiles, l’accès à Internet de nombreux enfants est moins surveillé et potentiellement plus dangereux.

Sans compter que des réseaux numériques comme l'Internet clandestin et les cryptomonnaies favorisent les pires formes d'exploitation et de maltraitance, y compris la diffusion en ligne de contenus pédopornographiques « sur commande » et la traite.

Le rapport offre des analyses et des données récentes sur l'utilisation d'Internet par les enfants et l’effet de la technologie numérique sur le bien-être des enfants, s'intéressant à des débats croissants sur « l'addiction » au numérique et les possibles effets du temps passé devant un écran sur le développement cérébral.

Autres points mis en avant dans le rapport :  

- Les jeunes constituent la tranche d’âge la plus connectée. À l’échelle mondiale, 71 % d’entre eux utilisent Internet contre 48 % pour la population totale.  

- Les jeunes Africains sont les moins connectés. Environ trois jeunes sur cinq n'utilisent pas Internet, contre seulement un sur 25 en Europe.  

- Dans un monde où 56 % des sites Internet sont en anglais, beaucoup d’enfants ne peuvent pas accéder à des contenus qu’ils comprennent ou qui sont en rapport avec leur culture.  

- Cinq pays hébergent à eux seuls plus de 9 sites pédopornographiques sur 10 confirmés à l’échelle mondiale : le Canada, les États-Unis, la France, la Fédération de Russie, et les Pays-Bas.  

Selon le rapport, seule une action collective de la part des gouvernements, du secteur privé, des organisations de défense des enfants, du milieu universitaire, des familles et des enfants eux-mêmes peut aplanir les disparités d’accès à Internet et rendre l'espace numérique plus accessible et plus sûr.

Parmi les recommandations pratiques qui peuvent contribuer à l'élaboration de politiques plus efficaces et à la mise en place de pratiques commerciales plus responsables bénéficiant aux enfants figurent les suivantes :

- Offrir à tous les enfants un accès abordable à des ressources en ligne de qualité.  
Protéger les enfants des dangers d’Internet – y compris la maltraitance, l’exploitation, la traite, l’intimidation et l’exposition à des contenus inappropriés.  

- Protéger la vie privée et l’identité des enfants en ligne.  

- Promouvoir l’habileté numérique pour permettre aux enfants de s’informer et de se connecter en toute sécurité.  
- Tirer parti du pouvoir du secteur privé pour faire progresser les normes et les pratiques éthiques qui protègent les enfants et servent leurs intérêts en ligne.  

- Placer les enfants au cœur de la politique numérique. 

« Conçu pour les adultes, Internet est de plus en plus utilisé par les enfants et les jeunes – et la technologie numérique affecte de plus en plus leur vie et leur avenir. Les politiques, pratiques et produits numériques devraient, de ce fait, davantage tenir compte des besoins des enfants, de leurs points de vue et de leur voix », conclut A. Lake.",268,"French"
2367994,"“Il n’y a pas grand-chose à récolter et à manger. La population n’a rien.” KASAI – Même si la paix est revenue dans de nombreux territoires de la région du Kasaï, les conséquences de la crise sur les enfants se font encore sentir aujourd’hui. Crispin est infirmier au centre nutritionnel de la zone de santé de Tshikaji, à une dizaine de kilomètres de Kananga. La zone a beaucoup souffert de la violence.

**Des mois sans accès aux services de base**   
Crispin lui-même a dû se cacher dans un petit local de son centre lorsque de violents combats ont fait rage à quelques mètres du centre. Lorsque plus tard, le centre a été occupé, il a fui pendant trois semaines. Aujourd’hui, la paix est revenue mais “la population ici continue à souffrir“.

Avant la violence, Crispin traitait en moyenne entre 10 et 15 enfants souffrant de malnutrition aiguë chaque jour. “Aujourd’hui, je dois prends en charge en moyenne 40 enfants“, souligne Crispin. “La population a dû se cacher pendant plusieurs mois dans la brousse, sans accès aux soins de santé, à l’eau potable et à l’assainissement. Il n’y avait presque pas de nourriture. Quand ils sont sortis de la brousse, beaucoup de jeunes enfants étaient sévèrement malnutris.”

**Peu d’espoir à court terme pour les populations du Kasai**  
Le Dr Bruno Kapinga, médecin chef de la zone de santé de Thsikashi, estime que la situation risque de ne pas s’améliorer à court terme. “Les gens n’ont pas été en mesure de cultiver leurs champs l’année dernière. Il n’y a donc pas grand-chose à récolter et à manger. La population n’a rien qu’ils peuvent vendre sur le marché local. Il leur manque l’argent pour payer pour les soins de santé de leurs enfants.”

De nombreux territoires dans la région du Kasaï sont aujourd’hui en niveau 4 en termes d’insécurité alimentaire, le deuxième niveau le plus dangereux. Les conséquences se feront sentir au moins jusqu’en juin 2018. Peut-être même plus longtemps, car il y a encore beaucoup de gens qui n’osent toujours pas encore se rendre sur leur champ, de peur d’être confrontés à nouveau à la violence. C’est une situation dangereuse qui risque de faire augmenter le nombre d’enfants souffrant de malnutrition aiguë.

**Objectif : sauver des vies**   
Crispin ne laisse se laisse pas décourager. Il est là pour sauver la vie des enfants. “Chaque matin, je commence par peser et mesurer les enfants qui viennent au centre. Chaque enfant qui prend du poids, me rend heureux. Avec la pâte thérapeutique d’arachides enrichie de minéraux et de vitamines que l’UNICEF met à notre disposition, je traite les enfants. Avec cette alimentation thérapeutique, un enfant peut être sauvé de la mort dans quelques jours.”

Dans un coin du centre, Crispin a créé un espace de cuisine où il donne aux mères des conseils pratiques pour assurer une alimentation saine et équilibrée à leurs enfants, avec le peu de nourriture qu’ils ont à leur disposition.

Monique est l’une des mères qu’aide Crispin. Elle s’est rendue il y a trois semaines au centre nutritionnel avec sa fille Tshitala, âgée d’un an et demi. Après avoir vécu trois mois en brousse, la petite fille était sévèrement ma nourrie et présentait des œdèmes sur tout le corps. Aujourd’hui Tshitala porte mieux mais Crispin précise que “sa maman va devoir s’assurer qu’elle donne à Tshitala une bonne alimentation pour qu’elle ne rechute pas dans la malnutrition.”

**Lutter contre la malnutrition aiguë sévère au Kasaï**    
Avant la crise du Kasaï, quatre zones de santé dans la Province du Kasaï Central et de la Province voisine du Kasaï étaient en état d’alerte nutritionnelle, avec plus de 2% des enfants souffrant de malnutrition sévère aiguë. Aujourd’hui, ce nombre a augmenté à quinze zones de santé. L’UNICEF estime que 700 000 enfants sont touchés par la malnutrition aiguë dans toute la région du Kasaï. 350 000 enfants souffrent de malnutrition aiguë sévère. Sans assistance, ces enfants risquent de mourir.

L’UNICEF et ses partenaires ne disposent actuellement que de 15% des fonds nécessaires pour prendre en charge les enfants souffrant de malnutrition sévère aiguë à Tshikaji et dans le reste de la région du Kasaï. Il y a donc un besoin urgent de plus de fonds pour éviter que des milliers d’enfants dans la région du Kasaï meurent des conséquences de la malnutrition.",268,"French"
2367954,"Après la violence au Kasaï, le retour à l’école se fait sous les tentes de l’UNICEF KASAI – Depuis plusieurs semaines, l’espoir refait surface à Kanzala, dans la périphérie de Tshikapa, capitale de la Province du Kasaï en République Démocratique du Congo. Les enfants ont retrouvé le chemin de l’école grâce à l’école temporaire sous des tentes de l’UNICEF.

**Des écoles temporaires au Kasaï**    
Deha Njeka est directeur de l’école Kamajiba à Kanzala. Il est heureux de pouvoir à nouveau accueillir ses élèves dans de bonnes conditions. Il parle avec émotion des événements du 4 décembre 2017 et de ce qui suit.

« Notre école a été complètement détruite. Les professeurs ont été oblige d’enseigner pendant des mois sous les arbres. A ce moment-là, il n’y avait presque pas d’enfants à l’école. Beaucoup avaient fui avec leur famille. Ils ne sont revenus que des mois plus tard lorsque la paix est revenue. »


L’école Kamajiba est loin d’être une exception. Plus de 400 écoles dans la [région du Kasaï}(http://ponabana.com/crise-kasai-enfants-victimes/) ont été pillées, incendiées ou détruites durant la crise et 440.000 enfants n’ont pas pu terminer l’année scolaire 2016-2017. Pour faire face à cette situation, l’UNICEF a organisé des cours de rattrapage pour des milliers d’enfants. Il faut également prévoir la reconstruction des écoles détruites, mais cela ne va pas de soi : il faut du temps et des fonds.

C’est pourquoi l’UNICEF a lancé un appel au Ministère de l’éducation pour qu’il autorise la mise en place d’écoles temporaires sous tentes. « Rien n’est aussi important pour des enfants qui ont connu l’horreur de la guerre que de retourner à l’école. À l’école, ils parviennent à lutter contre les traumatismes suite à la violence », précise Deha Njeka, le directeur de l’école Kamajiba.

**Un nouvel espoir pour l’avenir**   
Dès que Gouvernement a donné son approbation, l’UNICEF a commencé à installer des écoles temporaires dans les communautés où les écoles avaient été complètement détruites. L’école de Kamajiba est l’une des premières à avoir ouvert ses portes. L’école est composée de quatre grandes tentes qui abritent six classes de l’école primaire. Chaque classe a des bancs et un tableau scolaire. L’école a dix enseignants, dont quatre sont eux-mêmes des déplacés.

Mi-octobre, une centaine d’élèves étaient inscrits et de nouveaux enfants rejoignent l’école tous les jours. « Aujourd’hui nous accueillons 427 enfants », précise le directeur avec fierté. Bakala elle est l’une de ces élèves. Durant des mois, fuyant les violences avec sa mère, la jeune fille est restée sans éducation. Aujourd’hui elle est heureuse de retourner à l’école et a de nouveau espoir en l’avenir : elle veut devenir couturière.

**L’action de l’UNICEF et de ses partenaires**   
Dans toute la région du Grand Kasaï, l’UNICEF prévoit de créer 100 écoles temporaires qui permettront à un total de 33.000 enfants de retrouver le chemin de l’école. Il est crucial pour les enfants de reprendre le chemin de l’école pour restaurer un sentiment de normalité dans leur vie après des mois de peur et d’incertitude.",268,"French"

2367879,"L’OIM au Liban soutient la réinstallation de 1 937 réfugiés en France Beyrouth/Paris – La semaine dernière (24/11), l’OIM, l’organisme des Nations Unies chargé des migrations, a soutenu la réinstallation de 22 réfugiés syriens en France. Avec ce groupe, le nombre de réfugiés réinstallés en France depuis le Liban s’élève à 1 937 depuis le début du programme financé par l’UE en 2014.

Bruno Foucher, Ambassadeur de France au Liban, était présent à l’aéroport international Rafik Hariri à Beyrouth pour assister au départ des réfugiés et leur souhaiter le meilleur dans leur nouvelle vie en France.

L’OIM au Liban a aidé les réfugiés dès les entretiens de sélection jusqu’à leur départ. Elle a notamment organisé les déplacements nationaux et internationaux, a coordonné les demandes de sortie du territoire avec le HCR auprès de la Direction générale de la sécurité du Liban et a aidé les réfugiés à l’aéroport avant leur départ.

L’OIM en France a aidé les réfugiés à leur arrivée à Paris, en collaborant avec les ONG et les fournisseurs d’hébergement chargés de leur intégration, de leur suivi, de leur soutien et plus généralement de s’assurer que les réfugiés soient immédiatement pris en charge à leur arrivée en France.

« La réinstallation des réfugiés est un programme important qui démontre la solidarité et le sens des responsabilités partagées avec le Liban en réponse au problème des réfugiés dans ce petit pays qui accueille plus d’un million de réfugiés syriens », a déclaré Fawzi Al Zioud, responsable du Bureau de l’OIM au Liban.

Pour se préparer à leur réinstallation, les réfugiés ont assisté à des séances d’orientation avant le départ, qui visent à fournir aux réfugiés des informations pratiques sur la vie en France et sur les processus d’intégration et d’adaptation culturelle. Lors de ces séances interactives, des formateurs de l’OIM qui parlent la langue des réfugiés, ont traité des questions comme l’égalité homme-femme, les pratiques religieuses et les droits et devoirs dans le cadre du plan de réinstallation.

Avant le voyage, des médecins du Département de la santé des migrants de l’OIM ont réalisé des examens médicaux pour s’assurer que tous les réfugiés soient aptes à voyager et qu’ils ne souffrent d’aucune maladie qui pourrait compromettre la sécurité ou celle des autres passagers.

Parmi les réfugiés se rendant en France se trouvait Sham, 4 ans, dont c’était l’anniversaire en ce jour de départ, et qui était donc d’humeur festive. Comme les autres réfugiés du groupe, les parents de Sham ont fui la Syrie vers le Liban il y a quelques années et souhaitent démarrer une nouvelle vie en France.

Depuis janvier jusqu’au 24 novembre 2017, l’OIM au Liban a aidé à la réinstallation et au regroupement familial de 17 231 réfugiés et migrants dans 23 pays dont le Canada, le Royaume-Uni et la Suède. La France fait partie des 37 pays du monde mettant en place des programmes de réinstallation et est un des partenaires principaux de l’OIM dans la recherche de solutions durables et de prise en charge digne des réfugiés et des migrants.

Le programme actuel de réinstallation est financé par le programme national du Fonds de l’UE pour l’asile, la migration et l’intégration (FAMI), géré par le Ministère français de l’intérieur (Direction générale des étrangers en France).

2367339,"Avec l'aide de l'OIM, le Niger rapatrie par avion ses migrants de Libye 8 décembre 2017 – L'Organisation internationale pour les migrations (OIM) et le gouvernement du Niger ont commencé à évacuer les près de 4.000 migrants nigériens en Libye qui ont souhaité retourner volontairement dans leur pays d'origine.

Un premier avion charter transportant 504 migrants nigériens, dont des femmes et des enfants, est arrivé mercredi à l'aéroport international Diori Hamani de Niamey. Il s'agit du premier vol d'une série de huit dans le cadre d'une opération organisée par les autorités nigériennes. Au total, ce sont près de 3850 Nigériens enregistrés par leur ambassade en Libye qui pourront bénéficier d'un retour dans leur pays.

Cette opération d'évacuation de grande ampleur est menée avec l'appui technique et logistique de l'OIM. Le personnel de l'agence onusienne est présent à l'aéroport pour accueillir, enregistrer, profiler, fournir de la nourriture et de l'eau et faciliter le retour des rapatriés dans leurs villages d'origine. Une aide qui s'inscrit dans le cadre du mécanisme de ressources et d'intervention pour les migrants (MRRM) financé par l'Union européenne.

L'OIM et le gouvernement du Niger étudient également les possibilités de réintégration socio-économique des migrants qui vont arriver dans les prochaines semaines.

Le Ministre de l'Intérieur du Niger, Mohamed Bazoum, a salué le partenariat fructueux de son gouvernement avec l'OIM, et a félicité l'agence pour avoir rendu possible le retour digne des migrants nigériens dans les meilleures conditions possibles.

« Après les discussions au sommet [Union africaine-Union européenne] à Abidjan, le gouvernement a démontré son engagement à faire de cette évacuation une priorité et une réalité », a déclaré Alberto Preato, responsable du programme MRRM de l'OIM. « Le succès de l'opération est un tremplin pour le renforcement du partenariat entre l'OIM et le gouvernement du Niger. L'OIM est fière de participer à cette opération et de redonner espoir à ceux qui l'ont depuis longtemps perdue », a-t-il ajouté.

Les équipes de l'OIM ont quitté l'aéroport jeudi matin tôt après s'être assurées que les 504 migrants de retour rentraient chez eux. Le personnel de l'agence onusienne était prêt à accueillir le deuxième avion charter prévu ce vendredi.

En étroite collaboration avec leurs collègues en Libye, la mission de l'OIM au Niger se prépare à recevoir d'autres groupes de migrants qui se trouvent actuellement dans des centres de détention à travers le territoire libyen.

2367334,"L'ONU appelle à défendre les valeurs de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme aujourd'hui menacées 8 décembre 2017 – A l'occasion de la Journée des droits de l'homme, le [Secrétaire général](http://www.un.org/sg/fr) de l'ONU, António Guterres, et le Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l'homme, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, exhortent les citoyens et les dirigeants de tous les pays à se battre pour tous les droits de la personne.

Cette année, la Journée (10 décembre) marque le début d'une année de célébrations marquant le 70e anniversaire de l'adoption par l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme.

« La Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme consacre les principes de l'égalité et de la dignité de chaque être humain, et dispose que tout État a pour devoir essentiel de garantir à chacun l'exercice de l'ensemble de ses droits et libertés inaliénables », a rappelé le Secrétaire général dans [un message publié en vue de la Journée](https://www.un.org/press/fr/2017/sgsm18816.doc.htm).

Depuis la proclamation de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme en 1948, les droits de l'homme sont, avec la paix et le développement, les trois piliers de l'ONU.

« La Déclaration universelle a permis d'améliorer la vie quotidienne de millions de personnes, de prévenir d'innombrables souffrances humaines et de poser les fondations d'un monde plus juste », a pour sa part rappelé le Haut-Commissaire. « Bien que la vision qu'elle porte n'ait pas encore été pleinement réalisée, le simple fait qu'elle ait résisté à l'épreuve du temps démontre l'universalité de ses valeurs d'égalité, de justice et de dignité humaine », a-t-il ajouté.

**Droits de l'homme : des principes mis à l'épreuve partout dans le monde**

Si les progrès en matière de droits de l'homme sont indéniables, les grands principes de la Déclaration universelle sont mis à l'épreuve dans toutes les régions du monde, ont alerté les deux responsables onusiens.

« Nous voyons grandir l'hostilité envers les droits de l'homme et leurs défenseurs chez des individus qui cherchent à tirer profit de l'exploitation et de la division. Nous voyons se manifester la haine et l'intolérance, et assistons à des atrocités et crimes de toutes sortes », a déploré M. Guterres. « Ces actes représentent un danger pour chacun de nous », a prévenu le chef de l'ONU.

Rédigée au lendemain de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale et en connaissance de l'Holocauste, la Déclaration universelle souligne dans son préambule que 'la méconnaissance et le mépris des droits de l'homme ont conduit à des actes de barbarie qui révoltent la conscience de l'humanité'.

« Aujourd'hui, alors que la Seconde Guerre mondiale et l'Holocauste s'éloignent, cette prise de conscience semble s'estomper à un rythme alarmant », a déploré le Haut-Commissaire. « Les progrès gigantesques qui ont été réalisés grâce à la mise en œuvre progressive des principes énoncés dans la Déclaration universelle sont de plus en plus oubliés ou volontairement ignorés ».

Pour M. Zeid, l'universalité des droits de l'homme est contestée dans une grande partie du monde et est largement attaquée par les terroristes ainsi que des dirigeants autoritaires et populistes « qui semblent trop souvent disposés à sacrifier, à des degrés divers, les droits des autres au nom du pouvoir. Leur influence s'est accrue au détriment de la démocratie, de la paix et de la justice »

**« En fin de compte, cela dépend de nous, de 'Nous le peuple' »**

Bien que la Déclaration universelle constitue un engagement de tous les États à protéger et à promouvoir les droits de l'homme, M Zeid a souligné qu'elle doit également être un engagement de tous les individus qui doivent s'organiser et se mobiliser pour défendre la décence humaine et un meilleur avenir commun.

« Si nous ne défendons pas assez les droits de l'homme - si nous nous détournons quand ils sont maltraités - ils disparaitront lentement et mourront. Si cela arrive, le coût en vies humaines et la misère seront immenses, et l'humanité entière paiera un lourd tribut », a prévenu le Haut-Commissaire.

« En fin de compte, cela dépend de nous, de 'Nous le peuple' pour qui cette déclaration a été écrite. Cela dépend de moi, de vous, de chacun d'entre nous, dans chaque ville, province et pays où il y a encore la place pour s'exprimer, participer aux décisions, faire entendre sa voix », a déclaré le chef des droits de l'homme de l'ONU. « Nous devons agir pour promouvoir la paix, lutter contre la discrimination et défendre la justice ».",268,"French"
2367329,"Humanitaire : l'ONU appelle les Etats à contribuer à hauteur d'un milliard de dollars à son fonds d'intervention d'urgence 8 décembre 2017 – Le Secrétaire général des Nations Unies, António Guterres, a appelé vendredi les Etats à contribuer à hauteur de 1 milliard de dollars au Fonds central d'intervention d'urgence ([CERF](http://ochaonline.un.org/Default.aspx?alias=ochaonline.un.org/cerf)) - un fonds de l'ONU qui soutient les opérations humanitaires de secours dans le monde.

« Au cours des 12 dernières années, le CERF a été à la pointe de la réponse humanitaire », a déclaré le Secrétaire général des Nations Unies lors d'une conférence à New York, en remerciant les 126 Etats membres et observateurs, ainsi que les autres donateurs. « Le CERF est sans aucun doute l'un de nos outils les plus importants pour atteindre rapidement les gens et sauver des vies », a-t-il ajouté.

Pour le Secrétaire général adjoint des Nations Unies aux affaires humanitaires, Mark Lowcock, le calcul est simple. « Un CERF plus important signifie que plus de personnes pourront être atteintes avec une aide vitale, plus rapidement », a -t-il déclaré.

Cette année, le CERF qui est géré par le Bureau des Nations Unies pour la Coordination des Affaires Humanitaires ([OCHA](http://ochaonline.un.org/)), a financé à hauteur de 130 millions de dollars des activités qui ont permis de sauver des vies au Nigéria, en Somalie, au Soudan du Sud et au Yémen. Le fonds a également soutenu des interventions humanitaires dans d'autres régions, notamment pour les réfugiés palestiniens, pour les réfugiés rohingyas au Bangladesh et pour les victimes des ouragans Irma et Maria dans les Caraïbes.

M. Guterres a annoncé que 100 millions de dollars du CERF seront alloués pour répondre aux besoins critiques dans neuf situations d'urgence sous-financées en République démocratique du Congo (RDC), en Ouganda, en Tanzanie, au Cameroun, au Mali, aux Philippines, en Érythrée, en Haïti et au Pakistan.

Les conflits prolongés et l'impact des catastrophes naturelles, aggravés par la fragilité structurelle et la vulnérabilité chronique, ont augmenté le nombre de personnes qui se retrouvent en mode de survie, constamment sous la menace de castastrophes. L'année 2018 ne s'annonce pas meilleure, les conflits prolongés risquant d'être aggravés par les conséquences toujours plus intenses du changement climatique.

« Il n'y a aucun signe de relâchement des besoins humanitaires », a prévenu le chef de l'ONU, soulignant que l'Assemblée générale a adopté il y a un an une résolution appelant à un élargissement de l'objectif de financement annuel du CERF de 450 millions à 1 milliard de dollars.

Notant que le déficit de financement humanitaire mondial s'élevait à 11 milliards de dollars au 30 novembre et que les plans d'intervention humanitaire ne sont financés qu'à 60% en moyenne, le Secrétaire général a souligné qu'un CERF financé à hauteur de 1 milliard de dollars contribuera à renforcer le financement des urgences. « 1 milliard de dollars est un objectif ambitieux mais réalisable », a déclaré M. Guterres. “Une Organisation des Nations Unies forte a besoin d'un CERF fort », a-t-il martelé.",268,"French"
2367324,"Pour appuyer la Force conjointe des États du G5 Sahel, le Conseil de sécurité propose un accord technique avec l’ONU et l’Union européenne, via la MINUSMA CS/13112

CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ  
8129E SÉANCE – APRÈS-MIDI

Par la résolution 2391 (2017), adoptée à l’unanimité cet après-midi, et soumise par la France, le Conseil de sécurité demande au Secrétaire général de prendre les dispositions nécessaires pour conclure dès que possible un « accord technique » entre l’ONU, l’Union européenne et les États du G5 Sahel, en vue de fournir, par l’intermédiaire de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA), un appui opérationnel et logistique spécial à la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel.

La France a salué une résolution qui marque un véritable « bond en avant » du Conseil de sécurité sur la question de la paix et de la sécurité dans la région. La résolution a été appuyée par la Mauritanie et le Mali qui ont toutefois considéré que le soutien de l’ONU aurait pu être « plus large ».

Créée en début d’année par les États du G5 Sahel, à savoir le Burkina Faso, le Mali, la Mauritanie, le Niger et le Tchad, en vue de lutter contre le terrorisme et les réseaux criminels transnationaux, la Force conjointe, qui a été saluée par la [résolution 2359 (2017)](http://www.un.org/fr/documents/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2359(2017)) il y a six mois, compte des effectifs en personnel militaire et personnel de police pouvant aller jusqu’à 5 000 personnes.

Par ce texte, le Conseil précise que « l’appui ne serait accordé aux forces de défense et de sécurité des États du G5 Sahel que lorsqu’elles interviennent sur le territoire malien dans le cadre de la Force conjointe ». Cet appui prévoirait des évacuations sanitaires ainsi que l’accès aux articles consommables essentiels (carburant, eau et rations), l’utilisation d’engins de levage et de terrassement et de matériel de génie de l’ONU, et d’unités de génie en uniforme de la MINUSMA pour aider à préparer les bases opérationnelles de la Force conjointe au Mali.

L’ONU devrait être « pleinement remboursée » au moyen d’un dispositif de financement coordonné par l’Union européenne aux fins de la coordination des contributions volontaires internationales à l’appui de la Force conjointe, peut-on lire dans la résolution. De plus, le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général pour le Mali et Chef de la MINUSMA « peut décider ou non », en étroite coordination avec le Commandant de la Force d’accorder cet appui, « du moment que cela ne remette pas en question la capacité de la MINUSMA de s’acquitter de son mandat ». 

Le Conseil souligne par ailleurs que les opérations de la Force conjointe doivent être menées « dans le plein respect du droit international, notamment du droit international humanitaire, du droit international des droits de l’homme et du droit international des réfugiés ». 

Dans cet esprit, le Secrétaire général est prié de veiller à ce que tout appui fourni à des forces de sécurité non onusiennes soit « strictement conforme à la politique de diligence voulue en matière de droits de l’homme, et demande à la Force conjointe de coopérer avec l’ONU pour appliquer cette politique.

Enfin, le Conseil de sécurité invite le Secrétaire général à lui faire rapport sur les activités de la Force conjointe, cinq mois après l’adoption de la présente résolution, puis tous les six mois.

« La résolution que nous venons d’adopter ne se borne pas à créer un lien opérationnel entre la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel et la MINUSMA », a expliqué le représentant de la France. Elle entérine la détermination des pays du G5 Sahel à unir leurs efforts de lutte contre la menace terroriste et appelle chacun à prendre ses responsabilités pour que la Force conjointe atteigne au plus tôt sa pleine capacité opérationnelle. Pour lui, « l’accord technique » constitue « un tremplin » pour progresser. « Il s’agit d’une opportunité que nous ne devons pas rater », a-t-il lancé. 

Son homologue des États-Unis a salué « la créativité et l’innovation de cette résolution qui laisse voir ce qu’il est possible de faire à l’échelle internationale pour la résolution des conflits ». 

D’après le représentant du Mali, le G5 Sahel aurait souhaité obtenir un mandat « beaucoup plus robuste et placé sous le Chapitre VII de la Charte des Nations Unies », ainsi qu’un « soutien plus large de l’ONU » en termes de communication et d’équipements, une extension de l’appui à la MINUSMA à l’ensemble des fuseaux de déploiement de la Force conjointe (centre, est et ouest) et un financement prévisible et durable de cette force, « y compris à travers les Nations Unies ». 

La Mauritanie a insisté sur la nécessité d’assurer à la Force conjointe un financement adéquat et pérenne, de 423 millions d’euros au départ et de 115 millions d’euros par an par la suite, et de veiller à ce que la Force effectue des offensives sur toute la bande sahélo-saharienne.

Plusieurs délégations ont aussi rappelé l’importance de la mise en œuvre de l’Accord pour la paix et la réconciliation au Mali pour assurer la paix et la sécurité durables dans la région du Sahel.

En début de séance, le Conseil a observé une minute de silence à la mémoire des 14 Casques bleus tanzaniens tués hier dans une attaque en République démocratique du Congo (RPDC).

*Soulignant* que c’est aux États du G5 Sahel que revient la responsabilité principale de faire face à ces menaces et ces difficultés, et qu’il importe que la communauté internationale aide les États d’Afrique à unir leurs efforts au niveau régional ou sous régional pour lutter contre le terrorisme et la criminalité transnationale organisée en vue de rétablir la paix et la sécurité, notamment par la protection des civils,

*Saluant* les États du G5 Sahel pour la détermination constante avec laquelle ils unissent leurs efforts pour faire face aux répercussions du terrorisme et de la criminalité transnationale organisée, notamment au moyen de la création d’une force conjointe menant des opérations militaires conjointes transfrontalières de lutte contre le terrorisme (Force conjointe du G5 Sahel – « FC-G5S »), dont le déploiement a été autorisé par le Conseil de paix et de sécurité de l’Union africaine dans son communiqué du 13 avril 2017 et qu’il a accueilli avec satisfaction dans sa résolution [2359 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2359(2017)),

*Constatant avec satisfaction* les engagements pris à ce jour par plusieurs donateurs, notamment l’Allemagne, la Belgique, le Danemark, l’Espagne, l’Estonie, les États-Unis d’Amérique, la France, la Grèce, la Hongrie, l’Italie, le Luxembourg, la République tchèque, la Slovaquie, la Slovénie, la Turquie et l’Union européenne, pour ce qui est de fournir un appui à la Force conjointe,

*Constatant également avec satisfaction* les efforts réalisés par les forces françaises pour appuyer les opérations de la Force conjointe,

*Notant avec satisfaction* la contribution des partenaires bilatéraux et multilatéraux au renforcement des capacités en matière de sécurité dans la région du Sahel, en particulier le rôle joué par les missions de l’Union européenne (Mission de formation de l’Union européenne au Mali – EUTM Mali, Mission politique de sécurité et de défense commune de l’Union européenne au Mali – EUCAP Sahel Mali, et Mission politique de sécurité et de défense commune de l’Union européenne au Niger – EUCAP Sahel Niger) en dispensant des formations et des conseils stratégiques aux forces de sécurité nationales dans la région du Sahel,

*Prenant note* du rapport du Secrétaire général du 16 octobre 2017 sur la Force conjointe ([S/2017/869](https://undocs.org/fr/S/2017/869)), notamment la série d’options qui y sont présentées au titre de l’appui de l’Organisation des Nations Unies à la Force conjointe, et *notant* que les États du G5 Sahel ont accueilli très favorablement ce rapport,

*Rappelant* la mission qu’il a conduite dans la région du Sahel du 19 au 22 octobre 2017, en se rendant au Mali, en Mauritanie et au Burkina Faso, les principaux objectifs étant d’évaluer la situation dans les États du G5 Sahel et d’examiner les observations et recommandations formulées dans le rapport susmentionné du Secrétaire général,

*Notant* que la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA) et la Force conjointe peuvent être des instruments se renforçant l’un l’autre pour rétablir la paix et la stabilité au Mali et dans la région du Sahel, et *soulignan*t que cela pourrait être un exemple d’interaction positive entre une opération de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies et une opération africaine,

*Se déclarant de nouveau* gravement préoccupé par le fait que la MINUSMA ne dispose toujours pas de certaines capacités essentielles et *engageant* les États Membres à lui donner les moyens dont elle a besoin, notamment en faisant en sorte que les contingents et effectifs de police disposent des capacités voulues, des formations préalables au déploiement et, le cas échéant, des formations *in situ* ainsi que du matériel nécessaires, y compris les éléments habilitants voulus, en les adaptant au contexte opérationnel pour que la Mission continue d’avancer dans l’exécution de son mandat, conformément à la résolution [2364 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2364(2017)), notamment en adoptant une démarche qui soit la plus proactive et robuste possible,

*Soulignant* que la paix et la sécurité durables dans la région du Sahel ne seront pas assurées sans que l’Accord pour la paix et la réconciliation au Mali (l’« Accord ») soit appliqué intégralement, effectivement et sans exclusive, et *insistant* sur le fait que toutes les parties à l’Accord partagent la responsabilité principale d’enregistrer des progrès constants dans l’application de celui-ci,

*Soulignant* l’importance du rôle que jouent les femmes dans la prévention et le règlement des conflits, dans la consolidation de la paix et dans les situations d’après-conflit, comme il a été noté dans ses résolutions pertinentes, notamment les résolutions [1325 (2000)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/1325(2000)) et [2242 (2015)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2242(2015)),

*Notant* que les activités menées par des organisations terroristes, notamment celles qui tirent profit de la criminalité transnationale organisée dans la région du Sahel, constituent une menace pour la paix et la sécurité internationales,

**Groupe de soutien**

4. *Note* que le Groupe de soutien auquel il est fait référence dans le concept d’opérations stratégique de la Force conjointe constitue une plateforme utile et adaptée pour échanger des vues sur la capacité opérationnelle de la Force conjointe, la mobilisation et la coordination de l’appui international, la poursuite de la clarification de ses objectifs stratégiques et son concept d’opérations ainsi que l’application de stratégies complètes englobant la sécurité, la gouvernance, le développement, les droits de l’homme et les questions humanitaires;

5. *Encourage* les États du G5 Sahel à clarifier le format et les modalités de travail du Groupe de soutien, auquel doivent participer les principaux acteurs régionaux et internationaux soutenant la Force conjointe, et qui doit se réunir alternativement au niveau technique et politique;

6. *Demande* à la présidence tournante du G5 Sahel de convoquer régulièrement des réunions du Groupe de soutien pour continuer dʼassurer lʼintégration pleine et effective de la Force conjointe dans le cadre régional et international dans lequel elle opère, ainsi quʼune coordination efficace de lʼappui international apporté à la Force conjointe;

**Coordination de l’appui international**

7. *Note avec satisfaction* le rôle central que joue le G5 Sahel, avec l’appui de l’Union européenne et de ses États membres, notamment grâce au « pôle coordination », et en étroite concertation avec l’Organisation des Nations Unies et l’Union africaine, pour déterminer les besoins de la Force conjointe et coordonner les contributions bilatérales des donateurs;

8. *Note* le rôle positif que joue le Secrétariat permanent du G5 Sahel à l’appui de la coopération des États du G5 Sahel dans les domaines de la sécurité, de la gouvernance et du développement, et prie le Secrétaire général de prêter au Secrétariat permanent du G5 Sahel, dans le cadre du Bureau des Nations Unies pour l’Afrique de l’Ouest et dans les limites du mandat en vigueur et des ressources disponibles, l’assistance technique qui lui permettra de s’acquitter de cette tâche;

**Appui bilatéral**

9. *Note avec satisfaction* les engagements pris par les États du G5 Sahel et plusieurs donateurs pour ce qui est de financer la Force conjointe à hauteur d’un montant total de plus de 177 millions d’euros à ce jour, et les mesures déjà prises pour honorer certains de ces engagements;

10. *Prend note avec satisfaction* de la proposition faite par l’Union européenne, avec l’appui des États du G5 Sahel, tendant à ce que sa Facilité de soutien à la paix pour l’Afrique serve de dispositif de canalisation des contributions volontaires internationales à l’appui de la Force conjointe, en étroite coordination avec les autres contributions;

11. *Salue* l’intention qu’ont la présidence actuelle du G5 Sahel, l’Organisation des Nations Unies, l’Union africaine et l’Union européenne d’accueillir conjointement à Bruxelles une conférence internationale d’annonce de contributions à l’appui de la Force conjointe, et *encourage* tous les partenaires internationaux et régionaux à profiter de cette occasion pour s’engager à prêter une assistance bilatérale à la Force conjointe;

**Appui des Nations Unies**

12. *Souligne* que les mesures prises par la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel pour lutter contre les activités des groupes terroristes et autres groupes criminels organisés contribueront à sécuriser la région du Sahel, permettant ainsi à la MINUSMA de mieux s’acquitter de son mandat de stabilisation de la paix au Mali, et *souligne également* que l’appui opérationnel et logistique de la MINUSMA, comme indiqué au paragraphe 13 ci-dessous, peut aider la Force conjointe, compte tenu des moyens à sa disposition, à mieux exécuter son mandat;

13. *Prie* le Secrétaire général, dans ce contexte, de prendre les dispositions nécessaires pour conclure dès que possible un accord technique (l’« accord technique ») entre l’ONU, l’Union européenne et les États du G5 Sahel, en vue de fournir, par l’intermédiaire de la MINUSMA, un appui opérationnel et logistique spécial à la Force conjointe, selon les modalités suivantes:

a) L’appui ne serait accordé aux forces de défense et de sécurité des États du G5 Sahel que lorsqu’elles interviennent sur le territoire malien dans le cadre de la Force conjointe;

b) L’appui prévoirait des évacuations sanitaires primaires et secondaires ainsi que l’accès aux articles consommables essentiels (carburant, eau et rations), l’utilisation d’engins de levage et de terrassement et de matériel de génie de l’ONU, et d’unités de génie en uniforme de la MINUSMA pour aider à préparer les bases opérationnelles de la Force conjointe au Mali;

c) L’Organisation des Nations Unies devrait être pleinement remboursée au moyen d’un dispositif de financement coordonné par l’Union européenne aux fins de la coordination des contributions volontaires internationales à l’appui de la Force conjointe;

d) Le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général pour le Mali et Chef de la MINUSMA peut décider ou non, en étroite coordination avec le Commandant de la Force, d’accorder cet appui, du moment que cela ne remette pas en question la capacité de la MINUSMA de s’acquitter de son mandat et de poursuivre ses priorités stratégiques et qu’il soit limité aux zones d’opérations de la MINUSMA, compte tenu de ses capacités;

14. *Encourage* à voir dans l’accord technique une mesure temporaire, le but étant qu’à terme la Force conjointe devienne pleinement auto-suffisante et *souligne* que les arrangements d’appui de la MINUSMA, notamment ce qui concerne les évacuations sanitaires primaires et secondaires, les moyens en matière de génie ainsi que les chaînes d’approvisionnement logistique ne devraient pas être ajustés pour appuyer la Force conjointe si ses propres opérations devaient en pâtir ou son personnel s’en trouver indûment exposé à quelque risque;

15. *Recommande* que le Secrétaire général examine périodiquement l’application de l’accord technique, plus particulièrement l’opérationnalisation de la Force conjointe;

16. *Demande* à la MINUSMA et à la Force conjointe de continuer d’assurer, au moyen des dispositifs pertinents, la coordination de leurs opérations et d’échanger des informations à ce sujet, dans le cadre de leur mandats respectifs, et *prie de nouveau* à cet égard le Secrétaire général d’améliorer la coopération entre la MINUSMA et les États du G5 Sahel par la mise à disposition de renseignements pertinents et par l’intermédiaire d’agents de liaison des États du G5 Sahel auprès de la MINUSMA;

**Obligations découlant du droit international et des principes des droits de l’homme**

17. *Déclare* que les opérations de la Force conjointe doivent être menées dans le plein respect du droit international, notamment du droit international humanitaire, du droit international des droits de l’homme et du droit international des réfugiés, selon qu’il convient, et que les États du G5 Sahel et la Force conjointe doivent prendre des mesures actives pour réduire au minimum les risques pour les civils dans toutes les zones d’opérations ainsi que pour s’assurer que les coupables aient à répondre de leurs actes et transférer aux autorités de justice pénale ceux qui sont appréhendés lors d’opérations et suspectés de crimes terroristes ou connexes;

18. *Souligne* que la question de l’égalité des sexes doit être prise en compte dans tous les volets du concept stratégique des opérations de la Force conjointe, notamment par l’intégration de l’analyse des disparités entre les sexes et l’association des femmes aux évaluations, à la planification et aux opérations;

19. *Souligne* que les États du G5 Sahel doivent tenir compte du fait que des enfants sont associés aux groupes terroristes et groupes criminels transnationaux organisés et protéger et considérer comme des victimes ceux qui ont été relâchés ou séparés de quelque autre manière de ces groupes, et prêter particulièrement attention aux questions ayant trait à la protection, la libération et la réintégration de tous les enfants associés à ces groupes;

20. *Accueille avec satisfaction* la politique de tolérance zéro de l’Union africaine à l’égard de l’exploitation et des atteintes sexuelles et *souligne* que les États du G5 Sahel doivent prendre les mesures qui s’imposent pour prévenir et combattre l’impunité dans les cas d’exploitation et d’atteintes sexuelles commis par leurs contingents affectés à la Force conjointe;

21 *Demande* aux États du G5 Sahel d’appliquer les normes les plus élevées de transparence, de déontologie et de discipline à leurs contingents affectés à la Force conjointe, et d’établir un cadre réglementaire solide (le « cadre réglementaire ») pour prévenir toute violation du droit des droits de l’homme et du droit international humanitaire en rapport avec la Force conjointe, enquêter, prendre des sanctions ou rendre compte à ce sujet;

22. *Demande* aux partenaires régionaux et internationaux d’aider les États du G5 Sahel, au moyen de contributions volontaires et par l’offre d’une assistance technique et de conseils, dans leurs efforts pour établir et appliquer le cadre réglementaire que devront suivre les États du G5 Sahel et la Force conjointe, et *encourage* tous les partenaires concernés, notamment les entités des Nations Unies compétentes, l’EUTM, l’EUCAP et les forces françaises, dans la limite de leurs mandats respectifs et des ressources disponibles, à appuyer l’application du cadre réglementaire, et à coordonner étroitement leurs activités dans ce domaine;

23. *Prie* le Secrétaire général de veiller à ce que tout appui fourni à des forces de sécurité non onusiennes soit strictement conforme à la politique de diligence voulue en matière de droits de l’homme en cas d’appui de l’ONU à des forces de sécurité non onusiennes, et *demande* à la Force conjointe de coopérer avec l’ONU pour appliquer cette politique, notamment en mettant en place des mécanismes appropriés de suivi et d’établissement de rapports, qui soient fonctionnels; 

**Mise en œuvre de l’Accord pour la paix et la réconciliation au Mali**

24. *Déclare* être profondément préoccupé par les retards persistants dans la mise en œuvre intégrale des principales dispositions de l’Accord;

25. *Lance de nouveau* un appel pressant au Gouvernement malien et aux groupes armés de la Coalition et de la Plateforme, comme lors de sa réunion avec les membres du Comité de suivi de l’Accord, à Bamako, le 21 octobre 2017, afin qu’ils prennent immédiatement des mesures concrètes pour exécuter pleinement et rapidement leurs obligations restantes au titre de l’Accord, en particulier:

a) La mise en place des administrations intérimaires dans le nord du Mali,

b) La mise en place du mécanisme opérationnel de coordination à Kidal et à Tombouctou,

c) L’avancement des processus de cantonnement et de désarmement, de démobilisation et de réintégration, notamment l’élaboration de critères d’admissibilité appropriés et la présentation des listes définitives de candidats, ainsi que l’avancement de la réforme du secteur de la sécurité afin de parvenir au redéploiement progressif des forces armées et des forces de sécurité reconstituées au Mali,

d) L’avancement du processus de décentralisation,

e) La pleine participation des femmes, sur un pied d’égalité;

26. *Se félicite* que le Centre Carter ait été choisi pour assurer les fonctions d’Observateur indépendant prévues dans l’Accord; *rappelle* que l’Observateur indépendant a pour mandat, aux termes de l’Accord, d’évaluer en toute objectivité les progrès accomplis dans l’application de l’Accord, notamment en présentant tous les quatre mois un rapport détaillé sur le respect des engagements qui y ont été pris, en recensant les obstacles rencontrés, en identifiant ceux qui en sont la cause et en recommandant des mesures pour y remédier, et *appelle* toutes les parties à coopérer pleinement avec le Centre Carter pour l’aider à s’acquitter de son mandat en tant qu’Observateur indépendant;

27. *Déclare* que le fait de prendre part à des hostilités en violation de l’Accord ou de prendre des mesures qui font obstacle à la mise en œuvre de l’Accord, y compris par des retards persistants, ou menacent cette mise en œuvre, donne lieu à désignation aux fins de sanctions, en application de la résolution [2374 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2374(2017)), entre autres critères de désignation;

28. *Demande* aux membres du Comité de suivi de l’Accord et aux autres partenaires internationaux de continuer à appuyer la mise en œuvre de l’Accord;

32. *Demande* aux États du G5 Sahel de veiller à la pleine et égale participation des femmes aux institutions et mécanismes de prévention et de règlement des conflits, et d’inclure la questions de l’égalité des sexes dans l’élaboration de stratégies globales de lutte contre la menace posée par le terrorisme et la criminalité organisée (notamment la traite des personnes, le trafic d’armes, de drogues et de ressources naturelles et le trafic de migrants) dans la région du Sahel;

**Établissement de rapports et suivi**

33. *Prie* le Secrétaire général, agissant en étroite coordination avec les États du G5 Sahel et l’Union africaine, de faire rapport au Conseil de sécurité sur les activités de la Force conjointe, cinq mois après l’adoption de la présente résolution, puis tous les six mois, en mettant l’accent sur les points suivants:

i) Les progrès de l’opérationnalisation de la Force conjointe;

ii) L’appui international accordé à la Force conjointe et les mesures qui pourraient être prises pour renforcer son efficacité;

iii) L’application de l’accord technique, notamment au moyen d’un compte rendu détaillé de l’appui fourni par la MINUSMA à la Force conjointe, d’une évaluation de ses répercussions potentielles sur la MINUSMA, ainsi que de l’établissement d’indicateurs du niveau d’opérationnalisation de la Force conjointe pour que la MINUSMA sache à quel moment retirer progressivement son appui logistique et opérationnel;

iv) Les difficultés rencontrées par la Force conjointe et les mesures qui pourraient être envisagées;

v) L’application par les États du G5 Sahel du cadre réglementaire et de la Stratégie intégrée ainsi que les moyens d’atténuer les retombées négatives que pourraient avoir les opérations militaires de la Force conjointe sur la population civile, notamment les femmes et les enfants.

34. *Entend* réexaminer périodiquement le déploiement de la Force conjointe, sur la base des rapports du Secrétaire général;

35. *Décide* que les rapports du Secrétaire général mentionnés au paragraphe 33 ci-dessus remplacent les différents rapports sur la Force conjointe demandés au paragraphe 7 de la résolution [2359 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2359(2017)), qui cessera d’être en vigueur;

36. *Décide* de rester activement saisi de la question.

**Déclarations**

M. FRANÇOIS DELATTRE (France) a déclaré que, grâce à ce texte, les forces de sécurité des États du G5 Sahel opérant sur le territoire malien dans le cadre de la Force conjointe pourront bientôt bénéficier du soutien de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA) en matière de ravitaillement, d’évacuation médicale ou de moyens de génie. Un soutien fondamental, dans la mesure où il sera apporté directement sur le terrain, contrairement aux financements bilatéraux. « Mais la résolution que nous venons d’adopter ne se borne pas à créer un lien opérationnel entre la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel et la MINUSMA », a souligné le représentant. 

Selon lui, elle entérine la détermination des pays du G5 Sahel à unir leurs efforts de lutte contre la menace terroriste et appelle chacun « à prendre ses responsabilités pour que la Force conjointe atteigne au plus tôt sa pleine capacité opérationnelle ». Ce texte, a poursuivi M. Delattre, rappelle aussi que la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel ne saurait être un succès sans des efforts concomitants sur le terrain du développement et sans le respect des droits de l’homme. Enfin, a-t-il ajouté, elle affirme « avec force » qu’il ne saurait y avoir de stabilité durable au Sahel sans une mise en œuvre de l’accord pour la paix et la réconciliation au Mali.

Cette résolution marque donc un véritable « bond en avant » du Conseil de sécurité sur la question à l’ordre du jour, a estimé M. Delattre, qui a rappelé qu’il y a quelques mois encore, la mise à profit des moyens de la MINUSMA à l’appui de la Force conjointe était simplement « inenvisageable ». Mais ne nous y trompons pas, il reste encore beaucoup à faire, a-t-il ajouté. « Le mécanisme de l’accord technique, auquel il a été fait recours afin de contourner le cadre de contraintes qui s’impose aujourd’hui au Conseil, n’est évidemment pas celui qui recueillait notre préférence initiale », a-t-il expliqué. Il constitue toutefois « un tremplin » pour progresser davantage pour autant que les États du G5 continuent à prendre les mesures nécessaires pour permettre une pleine opérationnalisation de la Force. Il s’agit selon le délégué français « d’une opportunité que nous ne devons pas rater ». 

Mme NIKKI R. HALEY (États-Unis) a appelé à un soutien de la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel sur le long terme, précisant que les États-Unis s’engageaient à soutenir toute initiative allant dans ce sens. Les États-Unis se félicitent de l’appui technique que l’ONU devrait apporter à la Force, en vertu de la résolution adoptée cet après-midi. Leur représentante a salué « la créativité et l’innovation de cette résolution qui laisse voir ce qu’il est possible de faire à l’échelle internationale pour la résolution des conflits ». 

Relevant les annonces de contributions de l’Union européenne en faveur de la Force, Mme Haley a rappelé qu’il ne fallait pas oublier de veiller à ce que la MINUSMA reçoive tout l’appui nécessaire pour mener à bien son mandat. Les capacités actuelles de la Mission ne sont pas adéquates, a noté la déléguée, avant de souligner qu’elle ne saurait coopérer efficacement avec la Force sans des capacités idoines. Selon les États-Unis, le G5-Sahel doit veiller, dans le cadre des actions de la Force, au respect des droits de l’homme, et s’assurer que les priorités des communautés soient prises en compte.

M. AMR ABDELLATIF ABOULATTA (Égypte) a salué l’adoption par consensus de cette deuxième résolution sur la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel. Il a mis l’accent sur le fait que cette Force, qui est au départ une initiative volontaire et ambitieuse des pays de la région, constitue le meilleur choix sur le long terme pour parvenir à la paix et la sécurité dans cette région. Précisant que son rôle ne se limite pas aux frontières de ces États, il a souligné qu’il s’agit en effet d’« un combat sur l’un des fronts les plus durs de la lutte contre le terrorisme et le crime organisé dans le monde ». 

Pour le représentant, la communauté internationale doit appuyer les efforts de la Force conjointe. Il faut également régler les causes profondes de cette crise dans la région. L’adhésion de l’Égypte au consensus sur ce texte s’inscrit dans le cadre de son appui inconditionnel aux pays de cette région, a-t-il précisé. Il a regretté toutefois « l’incapacité du Conseil de sécurité à répondre aux besoins réels de cette Force dans le cadre d’un calendrier clair ». 

S’agissant de la MINUSMA, M. Aboulatta a dit qu’il fallait lui donner les ressources nécessaires pour réaliser son mandat et lui permettre de venir en soutien à la Force conjointe G5 Sahel. Il a invité le Conseil à revoir de manière périodique l’appui apporté à cette Force. Il est nécessaire également de revisiter les besoins à l’avenir pour fournir un financement durable et prévisible à cette Force, a conclu le délégué égyptien.

M. JONATHAN GUY ALLEN (Royaume-Uni) a salué le déploiement de la Force, expliquant que cette résolution établit un cadre clair pour son soutien. Se félicitant des contributions annoncées en faveur de la Force, il a indiqué que son pays examinait les moyens de lui apporter le meilleur soutien possible. Il a également encouragé les États du G5 Sahel à tirer parti de la coopération technique dont ils bénéficient afin de veiller au respect des droits de l’homme dans le cadre des activités de la Force. Pour le Royaume-Uni, l’efficacité de la Force sera mesurée à sa capacité d’aider les populations sur le terrain. 

M. PETR V. ILIICHEV (Fédération de Russie) a déclaré avoir voté en faveur de la résolution sur la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel en partant du principe que la communauté internationale doit aider ce groupement régional qui constitue une réponse appropriée aux problèmes de la région. Il a insisté sur l’importance d’une « réponse africaine à un problème africain », un principe que sa délégation encourage. 

Selon le représentant, il faut soutenir cette Force parce qu’elle s’occupera de l’élimination des groupes criminels transfrontaliers qui alimentent les groupes terroristes et parce qu’elle s’attaquera à ces derniers. Il a également souligné que ce n’est que grâce à des efforts coordonnés que les membres du G5 Sahel seront à même d’engranger des résultats efficaces. La Russie continuera d’aider les Sahéliens sur le plan bilatéral, a-t-il assuré.

M. CARL ORRENIUS SKAU (Suède) a précisé que toute initiative dans la région doit englober la gouvernance et les droits de l’homme et que les efforts au Sahel doivent être coordonnés avec la Stratégie intégrée des Nations Unies pour le Sahel et avec les partenaires clefs tels que l’Union africaine. Pour la Suède, il faudrait se garder d’apporter un appui à la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel qui saperait les capacités de la MINUSMA à bien remplir son mandat. C’est pourquoi il faut que les mécanismes de soutien à la Force puissent garantir un financement fiable et régulier à celle-ci. Le représentant a insisté également sur la mise en œuvre de l’Accord pour la paix et la réconciliation au Mali, soulignant le rôle que les femmes devraient y jouer. 

M. SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italie) a rappelé que le Sahel est confronté à des défis importants en termes de développement et de sécurité, tels que le terrorisme et la criminalité transnationale. C’est une question complexe que le Conseil a pu constater lors de sa mission sur le terrain en octobre 2017, a remarqué le représentant qui a également souligné les liens qui existent entre les défis sahéliens et l’instabilité dans la région méditerranéenne.

Pour l’Italie, il existe quatre aspects clefs du succès de la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel: la coordination et la coopération entre la Force et la MINSUMA et les missions de l’Union européenne; l’exigence d’une stratégie politique parallèle claire; l’exigence prioritaire que toute opération de la Force se déroule dans un cadre efficace de respect des droits de l’homme; l’appui des Nations Unies à cette force. Le Conseil de sécurité a l’obligation, selon l’Italie, de développer ces quatre aspects dans les mois à venir. Son pays se dit prêt à poursuivre les discussions sur cette question, a indiqué le représentant. 

M. ZHANG DIANBIN (Chine) a relevé que la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel a besoin de l’appui de la communauté internationale, et que c’est pour cette raison que son pays a voté en faveur de ce texte. La Chine insiste pour que le Conseil de sécurité tienne compte des priorités et des exigences africaines dans le cadre du partenariat visant à soutenir la Force. 

M. TEKEDA ALEMU (Éthiopie) s’est félicité de l’adoption à l’unanimité de la résolution sur la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel. Il ne fait aucun doute, selon lui, que l’appui du Conseil de sécurité et du reste de la communauté internationale est essentiel pour poursuivre la lutte contre le terrorisme et les autres crimes transfrontaliers dans la région du Sahel, et parvenir à neutraliser les bandes criminelles qui y opèrent. 

Bien que la résolution ne soit pas à la hauteur des espoirs de sa délégation, le représentant a salué l’esprit de compromis dont ont fait montre les États Membres, en particulier les États-Unis. L’adoption de cette résolution ne saurait être plus opportune à la lumière de la conférence qui aura lieu à Bruxelles la semaine prochaine pour appuyer la Force conjointe G5 Sahel, a-t-il conclu.

Le mécanisme de financement de la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel, intégré dans cette résolution du Conseil de sécurité, représente « un pas en avant dans la lutte contre les fléaux touchant le Sahel », a reconnu M. FODÉ SECK (Sénégal). Il a salué l’engagement des pays du Sahel qui ont supporté les premiers coûts financiers et humains de la Force avant la réaction de soutien de la communauté internationale. Le Sénégal appelle toutefois à « davantage de générosité et de solidarité agissant en faveur de la Force », de manière bilatérale et multilatérale, et au cours des futures conférences internationales d’annonces de contributions. 

Saluant l’adoption à l’unanimité de la résolution 2391 (2017), M. KORO BESSHO (Japon) a rendu hommage aux efforts déployés par la France, lesquels ont rendu possible cette initiative visant à rétablir la paix et la stabilité au Mali et dans la région du Sahel. Le Japon, a-t-il précisé, a soutenu cette résolution parce qu’il considère que le Mali a besoin d’aide pour voir se réaliser les dispositions clefs de l’Accord de paix. À cette fin, a poursuivi le représentant, le texte contient des mesures de soutien innovantes, notamment au travers de la MINUSMA en recourant au mécanisme de financement coordonné par l’Union européenne. 

M. Bessho a toutefois averti que le succès de ces efforts dépend du soutien de la communauté internationale, qui doit se mobiliser pour mettre en œuvre la résolution adoptée ce jour. Avant de conclure, il a réaffirmé que les conséquences et les effets des activités terroristes au Mali et au Sahel ne pourront être résolus par la seule force armée. Jugeant qu’il devient de plus en plus crucial de répondre à l’extrémisme violent d’une manière globale, il a plaidé pour la construction d’une société et d’institutions résilientes, capables de garantir la sécurité humaine. 

M. ISSA KONFOUROU (Mali) a apprécié de participer à cette réunion consacrée à l’adoption, en moins de six mois, de la deuxième résolution sur la Force conjointe du G5 Sahel, endossée par l’Union africaine. Cette résolution, a-t-il dit, s’inscrit dans une « bonne dynamique de renforcement progressif du soutien international » en faveur de la Force à laquelle contribuent le Burkina Faso, le Mali, la Mauritanie, le Niger et le Tchad. 

M. Konfourou a toutefois émis quelques réserves, rappelant notamment que le G5 Sahel aurait souhaité obtenir un mandat « beaucoup plus robuste et placé sous le Chapitre VII de la Charte des Nations Unies », ainsi qu’un soutien plus large de l’ONU en termes de communication et d’équipements, une extension de l’appui à la MINUSMA à l’ensemble des fuseaux de déploiement de la Force conjointe (centre, est et ouest) et un financement prévisible et durable de cette force, « y compris à travers les Nations Unies ».

Cependant, a-t-il concédé, « nous ne désespérons pas ». Le délégué s’est ainsi déclaré reconnaissant à chacun des membres du Conseil pour les « progrès déjà réalisés », se disant confiant que les attentes du G5 Sahel seront satisfaites dans le cadre des clauses de rendez-vous et d’examens périodiques prévues par cette résolution. 

M. OUSMANE BA (Mauritanie) a réaffirmé la profonde reconnaissance de son pays à l’ONU pour son engagement en faveur de la paix, de la sécurité et du développement dans la région du Sahel. Il a également salué les efforts consentis par les partenaires bilatéraux et multilatéraux, dont la France, l’Union européenne, l’Union africaine, les États-Unis et l’Alliance de l’Arabie saoudite, qui se sont engagés à soutenir le G5 Sahel et sa force opérationnelle.

La Mauritanie a très tôt compris et su mesurer l’ampleur des défis de la menace terroriste dans la région, a expliqué son représentant, puisque dès 2008, elle a donné la priorité, à travers une stratégie multidimensionnelle, à la lutte contre l’extrémisme violent, le terrorisme, et le trafic transfrontalier de drogue et de personnes.

La Mauritanie s’est engagée à participer à la Force conjointe G5 Sahel, a assuré M. Ba. Il a tenu à souligner trois points essentiels pour son opérationnalisation effective et efficace: la légalité internationale de la Force à travers une autorisation expresse du Conseil de sécurité; le financement adéquat et pérenne, tel que planifié, de 423 millions d’euros au départ et de 115 millions d’euros par an, par la suite; les offensives sur toute la bande sahélo-saharienne.

CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ  
8127E SÉANCE – MATIN

Sacrifiant à la tradition du mois de décembre, le Conseil de sécurité a entendu, ce matin, les six présidents sortants de neuf de ses organes subsidiaires, créés pour l’assister sur l’application de sanctions et autres questions spécifiques. Ces derniers ont avancé des propositions destinées à accroître l’efficacité de leur comité ou groupe de travail, notamment au travers d’un dialogue plus étroit avec les États Membres et les différentes parties prenantes et d’un appui plus soutenu aux groupes d’experts associés. 

En sa qualité de Président du Comité 2206 sur le Soudan du Sud, le représentant du Sénégal, M. Fodé Seck, a souligné le rôle central joué par le Groupe d’experts dépendant de cet organe subsidiaire, lequel a réitéré en 2017 sa recommandation d’imposer un embargo sur les armes dans ce pays et de confier à la Mission des Nations Unies au Soudan du Sud (MINUSS) le soin de surveiller la mise en œuvre de l’embargo. Ce même groupe d’experts a recommandé que le Comité désigne les responsables des actions et des politiques menaçant la paix, la sécurité et la stabilité du Soudan du Sud. 

Prenant ensuite la parole en tant que Président du Groupe de travail sur les opérations de maintien de la paix, M. Seck a fait état du regain d’intérêt, notamment des pays contributeurs de troupes et de police, pour le dialogue avec le Conseil de sécurité et le Secrétariat. Jugeant important de « capitaliser sur cette dynamique positive », il a suggéré que les futures réunions du Groupe de travail revêtent un caractère informel et qu’elles se déroulent en amont de la prorogation des mandats. 

Le renforcement du dialogue entre les Nations Unies et les États Membres a également été au centre de l’intervention de M. Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta, représentant de l’Égypte et Président, au cours des deux dernières années, des Comités 1533 concernant la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), 1373 sur la lutte antiterroriste et 1518 concernant la situation entre l’Iraq et le Koweït. Il s’est ainsi enorgueilli d’avoir organisé à cette fin « le plus de réunions publiques possible », ce qui s’est notamment traduit par l’adoption de neuf résolutions sur la lutte contre le terrorisme. 

Soucieux de voir le Conseil doter le Comité 1373 des ressources nécessaires pour s’acquitter de son mandat et renforcer sa coopération avec le Bureau de lutte contre le terrorisme nouvellement créé, il a également indiqué, s’agissant du Comité 1518, que de nombreuses personnes continuaient d’être rayées des listes de sanctions bien que l’instance n’ait pas été en mesure de se réunir au cours des dernières années. Il a par ailleurs souligné qu’il avait eu à cœur de faire avancer le dossier traité par le Comité 1533. C’est ainsi, a-t-il dit, que la RDC a été « très régulièrement » invitée aux réunions du Comité, et ce, dans le but de permettre une meilleure compréhension des sanctions. Partisan d’une approche holistique de cette question, M. Aboulatta a en outre souligné l’importance pour le Conseil d’appuyer le groupe d’expert associé au comité, qui a permis de lui fournir une « mine d’informations » utiles. 

Lui aussi attaché à l’instauration d’un dialogue approfondi entre les organes subsidiaires du Conseil et les autorités des pays concernés, M. Volodymyr Yelchenko, représentant de l’Ukraine et Président des Comités 2127 concernant la République centrafricaine et 1591 sur le Soudan, a encouragé les nouveaux présidents de comité à maintenir la coopération de leur instance avec les groupes d’experts en prise avec le terrain. Les données « mises à jour et de première main » que fournissent ces derniers sont d’une importance cruciale pour les membres du Conseil qui ne disposent pas de mission diplomatique dans ces pays, a-t-il souligné, saluant également l’apport des représentants spéciaux du Secrétaire général à cet effort d’information.

En dépit de ces développements positifs, M. Yelchenko a déploré qu’un comité puisse se retrouver paralysé par une « politisation totalement inévitable » de ses travaux et un « recours abusif » à la règle du consensus. Pour ces motifs, a-t-il ajouté, le Comité concernant le Soudan n’a informé le Conseil de ses activités que la veille de la présente réunion, son rapport trimestriel n’ayant pu être présenté dans les temps aux États Membres. 

Président du Comité 1718 sur la non-prolifération nucléaire en République populaire démocratique de Corée (RPDC), le représentant de l’Italie, M. Sebastiano Cardi, qui s’exprimait aussi en sa qualité de Facilitateur pour la mise en œuvre de la résolution 2231 (2015), par laquelle le Conseil a approuvé le Plan d’action global commun sur la question du nucléaire iranien, a affirmé avoir été guidé dans son action par la recherche constante de consensus. 

Mais si l’unité du Conseil est essentielle pour obtenir des résultats, la transparence l’est tout autant. C’est pourquoi M. Cardi a déclaré s’être employé à investir le temps et les ressources nécessaires pour améliorer cet aspect, en organisant notamment deux réunions publiques et cinq réunions régionales sur le dossier nord-coréen, ce qui a, selon lui, permis aux États Membres d’exprimer les difficultés rencontrées dans la mise en œuvre des résolutions du Conseil. Il a encouragé les futurs présidents à suivre une approche similaire.

Cette volonté de dialogue et d’information a été reprise par M. Elbio Oscar Rosselli Frieri, Président du Comité du Conseil de sécurité créé par la résolution 2048 (2012) concernant la Guinée-Bissau et du Groupe de travail informel sur les tribunaux internationaux. Le représentant de l’Uruguay a ainsi fait valoir qu’il avait pu effectuer, en juin dernier, la première visite en Guinée-Bissau d’un président du Comité en cinq ans d’existence. Une expérience qui, a-t-il dit, l’a convaincu de la nécessité de renforcer la coopération entre le Comité, le Conseil de sécurité et la population du pays. 

Président du Comité 1636 concernant le Liban, le représentant du Japon, M. Koro Bessho, s’est pour sa part largement exprimé en tant que Président du Comité 2140 concernant le Yémen et Président du Groupe de travail informel sur la documentation et les autres questions de procédure. Évoquant la situation politique précaire au Yémen, il a salué les travaux du Groupe d’experts du Comité 2140, lequel s’est, selon lui, montré très actif en présentant « de nombreuses études de cas utiles ». Il a enfin indiqué avoir axé ses travaux sur une plus grande ouverture pour faciliter la sélection des présidents des organes subsidiaires. 

***EXPOSÉS DES PRÉSIDENTS DES ORGANES SUBSIDIAIRES DU CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ***

M. FODÉ SECK (Sénégal) s’est, dans un premier temps, exprimé en sa qualité de Président du Comité 2206 sur le Soudan du Sud (2015). Il a expliqué qu’une question aura été au centre des préoccupations du Comité, à savoir si l’imposition d’un embargo sur les armes ainsi que de nouvelles désignations contribueraient oui ou non à faire avancer la paix dans ce pays. 

« À ce propos, il est possible de s’interroger sur l’opportunité pour le Conseil de recueillir et de tenir compte du point de vue de la région avant d’envisager d’autres mesures, au lieu d’assumer, au besoin, sa responsabilité principale, en vertu de la Charte des Nations Unies, de maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales », a déclaré M. Seck. Une interrogation qui a conduit à un projet de résolution présenté au Conseil de sécurité le 23 décembre 2016, « peu après mon retour du Soudan du Sud », par lequel était proposé l’instauration d’un embargo sur les armes, avec en annexe une liste de quatre noms supplémentaires à désigner pour des sanctions immédiates. Ce texte, n’ayant pas recueilli les neuf voix nécessaires, ne fut pas adopté. 

Après avoir détaillé le programme de travail du Comité au cours des deux dernières années, le Président sortant a indiqué que le Groupe d’experts qui en dépend a réitéré en 2017 sa recommandation d’imposer un embargo sur les armes au Soudan du Sud et de confier à la Mission des Nations Unies au Soudan du Sud (MINUSS) le soin de surveiller la mise en œuvre de l’embargo et les moyens de le faire efficacement. 

Le Groupe d’experts, a-t-il précisé, a également recommandé que le Comité désigne les responsables des actions et des politiques qui menacent la paix, la sécurité et la stabilité du Soudan du Sud, au sujet desquels des éléments de preuve auraient été réunis. 

Prenant ensuite la parole en sa qualité de Président du Groupe de travail sur les opérations de maintien de la paix, il a estimé que la première observation à tirer est le regain d’intérêt, notamment des pays contributeurs de troupes et de police, pour le dialogue avec le Conseil de sécurité et le Secrétariat.

Il importe, par conséquent, de capitaliser sur cette dynamique positive pour renforcer davantage le dialogue stratégique entre le Conseil de sécurité, le Secrétariat et les pays fournisseurs de contingents, au travers d’un dialogue plus substantiel entre ces acteurs pour un meilleur impact sur le terrain. À cet égard, a-t-il dit, la réunion du Groupe de travail du 10 novembre 2017, consacrée à l’amélioration du dialogue triangulaire, et celle du 3 octobre 2017 avec les États-Unis sur la réforme des opérations de maintien de la paix, ont amorcé une « dynamique de coopération plus poussée ».

M. Seck a suggéré que les futures réunions revêtent un caractère informel, qu’elles se déroulent en amont de la prorogation des mandats, mais « immédiatement » après la publication du rapport du Secrétaire général pertinent. 

En outre, pour le Président sortant, les réunions devraient se tenir au niveau des experts plutôt que des représentants permanents « afin d’éviter la lecture de remarques formelles ». 

M. AMR ABDELLATIF ABOULATTA (Égypte) est revenu sur les différents mandats qu’il a occupés au cours des deux dernières années, en tant que Président du Comité du Conseil de sécurité créé par la résolution 1533 (2004) concernant la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), du Comité créé par la résolution 1373 (2001) concernant la lutte antiterroriste et du Comité 1518 (2003) concernant la situation entre l’Iraq et le Koweït. 

En sa qualité de Président du Comité 1373, M. Aboulatta a rappelé que le Comité de lutte contre le terrorisme avait réalisé 22 visites d’évaluation dans des États Membres issus des cinq groupes régionaux des Nations Unies, afin de vérifier leur mise en œuvre des résolutions 1373 (2001), 1624 (2005) et 2178 (2014). Ces visites ont, selon lui, permis au Comité d’interagir efficacement avec les États Membres concernant leurs pratiques et leurs mesures déployées pour lutter contre le terrorisme. Outre ces visites, le Président a également insisté sur le rôle important joué par deux autres outils, à savoir les enquêtes détaillées sur la mise en œuvre et les bilans généraux de la mise en œuvre. Durant son mandat, le Président a dit s’être employé à organiser le plus de réunions publiques possibles, afin de renforcer le dialogue entre les Nations Unies et les États Membres. Le Conseil, s’est-il enorgueilli, a en outre adopté neuf résolutions sur la lutte contre le terrorisme au cours de la période considérée, signe de sa détermination à lutter contre ce fléau. M. Aboulatta a appelé le Conseil à doter le Comité 1373 des ressources nécessaires pour s’acquitter de son mandat et renforcer sa coopération avec le Bureau de lutte contre le terrorisme nouvellement créé. Le Président a justement appelé à s’appuyer sur la réforme de l’architecture des Nations Unies de lutte contre le terrorisme pour éviter les doublons. Enfin, il a appelé les États Membres à s’acquitter de leurs obligations dans la lutte contre le terrorisme.

Concernant, brièvement, le Comité 1518, bien que ce dernier n’ait pas été en mesure de se réunir au cours des dernières années, le Président a précisé que de nombreuses personnes avaient été et continuaient d’être rayées des listes de sanctions. 

S’agissant enfin du Comité 1533, le Président a souligné qu’il avait eu à cœur, en tant que représentant d’un pays africain, de faire avancer ce dossier. À cette fin, il a déclaré que la RDC avait été très régulièrement invitée aux réunions du Comité, et ce, dans le but de renforcer la coopération entre ce dernier et le pays et de permettre une meilleure compréhension des sanctions. M. Aboulatta s’est en outre prononcé en faveur d’une approche holistique de cette question, une vision qui a conduit le Comité à élargir son dialogue avec les organisations régionales et sous-régionales, ainsi qu’avec les États de la région, comme le démontrent les réunions publiques organisées par le Comité sur des points précis tels que la lutte contre l’exploitation illicite et le trafic des ressources naturelles. Enfin, le Président a souligné l’importance pour le Conseil de sécurité d’appuyer le groupe d’experts associé au Comité, qui a permis de lui fournir une « mine d’informations » utiles.

M. VOLODYMYR YELCHENKO (Ukraine), Président du Comité 2127 concernant la République centrafricaine et du Comité 1591 concernant le Soudan, a tout d’abord souligné l’importance d’un dialogue approfondi entre le président d’un organe subsidiaire du Conseil de sécurité et les autorités du pays concerné par son comité. À ses yeux, il s’agit non seulement de renforcer la mise en œuvre du régime des sanctions, mais aussi de faire progresser la recherche des racines des crises et des conflits et de contribuer au redressement postconflit. Dans cet esprit, il a dit s’être employé, au cours des 24 derniers mois, à intensifier les échanges avec les deux pays concernés, tout en améliorant les contacts avec les autres organes subsidiaires du Conseil, les pays voisins et les autres parties prenantes.

De ses visites en République centrafricaine en 2016 et au Soudan en 2017, M. Yelchenko a affirmé retenir la « valeur du dialogue » avec l’ensemble des acteurs impliqués. Il a dit avoir également tenu à maintenir ses comités aussi informés que possible sur les dynamiques à l’œuvre pour le règlement des conflits dans ces pays. À cette fin, il a organisé plusieurs réunions avec la Représentante spéciale du Secrétaire général pour le sort des enfants en temps de conflit armé et son homologue en charge des violences sexuelles en période de conflit. Il s’est aussi félicité de ses rencontres informelles avec des membres de la société civile et des réunions d’information avec le Service antimines des Nations Unies et l’Institut des Nations Unies pour la recherche sur le désarmement (UNIDIR) s’agissant du Comité 2127. 

M. Yelchenko a également insisté sur l’importance du dialogue qu’il a maintenu avec le Représentant spécial, et Chef de la MINUSCA, et avec son homologue qui est à la tête de l’Opération hybride Union africaine-Nations Unies au Darfour (MINUAD). Tous deux ont maintenu les Comités informés sur l’évolution de la situation sécuritaire et politique dans les deux pays, a-t-il précisé, expliquant que ces informations « mises à jour et de première main » sont d’une importance cruciale pour les membres du Conseil qui ne disposent pas de mission diplomatique dans ces pays. À cet égard, il a encouragé les nouveaux présidents de comités à maintenir cette coopération avec les groupes d’experts en prise avec le terrain.

S’agissant du Comité 2127, M. Yelchenko a indiqué qu’il avait organisé en septembre dernier une réunion d’information en présence des délégations des États régionaux mais aussi d’autres États Membres afin d’évoquer les défis auxquels la région est confrontée, notamment en matière d’application du régime des sanctions des Nations Unies. Cette rencontre a confirmé le rôle crucial que joue la coopération internationale pour assurer la mise en œuvre effective des interdictions de voyage et faire obstacle aux trafics illicites d’armements et à la contrebande transfrontalière de ressources naturelles.

Par ailleurs, le Comité 1591 concernant le Soudan a tenu, en novembre, ses premières consultations informelles conjointes avec les Comités 1970 sur la Libye et 2206 sur le Soudan du Sud, a encore indiqué M. Yelchenko, notant que les discussions avaient porté sur la progression des groupes armés originaires du Darfour sur le territoire de ces deux pays et sur les moyens d’y faire face. Ce type de consultations, a-t-il observé, constitue le point de départ d’une « approche holistique » pour le traitement des menaces posées par ces groupes armés.

En dépit de ces développements positifs, M. Yelchenko a estimé que beaucoup restait à faire pour faire évoluer l’action des présidents des comités. Trop souvent, a-t-il déploré, un comité peut se retrouver paralysé par une « politisation totalement inévitable » de ses travaux et un « recours abusif » à la règle du consensus. Pour ces motifs, a-t-il regretté, le Comité concernant le Soudan n’a pu présenter son rapport trimestriel aux États Membres. De fait, le Président du Comité 1591 a déclaré n’avoir pu informer le Conseil sur ses activités que la veille de la présente réunion. 

M. SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italie), Président du Comité 1718 sur la non-prolifération nucléaire en République populaire démocratique de Corée (RPDC), a souligné qu’il s’exprimait également aujourd’hui en sa qualité de Facilitateur pour la mise en œuvre de la résolution 2231 (2015), par laquelle le Conseil a approuvé le Plan d'action global commun sur la question du nucléaire iranien. Dans le cadre de ses deux mandats, M. Cardi a déclaré qu’il avait déployé, avant toute chose, des « efforts constants » dans le but de parvenir au consensus. En effet, selon lui, le principe de l’unité du Conseil de sécurité dans l’action est extrêmement important pour garantir son efficacité. Les efforts de M. Cardi en ce sens lui ont notamment permis de mieux faire comprendre les enjeux et ressorts de la résolution 2231, qui est particulièrement innovante et devait être bien assimilée par l’ensemble des États Membres. De même, s’agissant de la RPDC, le Président a indiqué que, face au large éventail de sanctions et à la succession rapide de nouvelles mesures adoptées lors des mois précédents, son comité s’était attelé tout particulièrement à assister les États Membres et les organisations internationales.

Si l’unité est essentielle pour obtenir des résultats, a par ailleurs estimé M. Cardi, la transparence est également fondamentale. C’est pourquoi il a eu à cœur d’investir le temps et les ressources nécessaires pour améliorer cet aspect, en organisant notamment deux réunions publiques et cinq réunions régionales sur le dossier nord-coréen, ce qui a selon lui permis aux États Membres d’exprimer les difficultés rencontrées dans la mise en œuvre des résolutions du Conseil. M. Cardi a encouragé les futurs présidents à suivre une approche similaire.

Tout en renouvelant, en conclusion, son appui sans réserve au Plan d’action global commun concernant l’Iran, M. Cardi a appelé les États Membres, concernant la RPDC, à redoubler d’efforts pour ramener le pays à la table des négociations. À ses yeux, c’est là le rôle principal du Comité 1718, qui doit aussi freiner le développement du programme nucléaire nord-coréen et appeler Pyongyang à retourner à la légalité internationale.

M. ELBIO OSCAR ROSSELLI FRIERI (Uruguay), Président du Comité du Conseil de sécurité créé par la résolution 2048 (2012) concernant la Guinée-Bissau et du Groupe de travail informel sur les tribunaux internationaux, a regretté le manque d’évolution de la crise politique en Guinée-Bissau, en dépit des efforts régionaux et internationaux entrepris en vue de trouver une solution durable. De fait, a-t-il précisé, aucune des dispositions de l’Accord de Conakry n’a été mise en œuvre. La communauté internationale aura beau faire tous les efforts possibles, seules les dirigeants politiques du pays pourront mettre fin à l’instabilité, a estimé M. Rosselli Frieri, tout en rappelant que 2018 était une année électorale pour le pays. 

En tant que Président du Comité 2048, il a rappelé avoir effectué une visite sur le terrain en juin 2017, la première visite en Guinée-Bissau d’un président du Comité en cinq ans d’existence. Cette expérience a convaincu M. Rosselli Frieri de la nécessité de renforcer la coopération entre le Comité, le Conseil de sécurité et la population du pays. Dans ce sens, il a encouragé les futurs présidents du Comité 2048 à se rendre au moins une fois dans le pays.

Aux yeux du Président, les sanctions du Conseil ont joué pour beaucoup dans le maintien de l’ordre constitutionnel en Guinée-Bissau, sans toutefois se traduire par une ouverture au niveau politique. Il a par conséquent appelé à passer au peigne fin la liste des sanctions imposées par le Conseil afin d’en évaluer leur pertinence par rapport aux objectifs fixés.

En tant que Président du Groupe de travail informel sur les tribunaux internationaux, M. Rosselli Frieri a rappelé que le Tribunal pénal international pour l’ex-Yougoslavie (TPIY) fermerait ses portes le 31 décembre prochain. Il a indiqué que le Groupe de travail s’employait à rédiger une déclaration de presse à la hauteur de cet évènement historique. Étant donné que la mission du TPIY de juger les responsables de violations graves du droit international humanitaire dans les pays issus de l’ex-Yougoslavie est, elle, toujours d’actualité, le Président a appelé le Conseil à soutenir le Mécanisme international appelé à exercer les fonctions résiduelles des tribunaux pénaux qui prend le relais après la fermeture du TPIY. 

M. KORO BESSHO (Japon), Président du Comité du Conseil de sécurité créé par la résolution 1636 (2005), créé pour enregistrer les personnes désignées par la Commission d’enquête internationale indépendante ou le Gouvernement libanais comme étant suspectes de participation à l’attentat terroriste à l’explosif, perpétré le 14 février 2005, à Beyrouth, au Liban, qui a coûté la vie à l’ex-Premier Ministre libanais Rafiq Hariri et à 22 autres personnes, s’exprimait également en tant que Président du Comité du Conseil créé par la résolution 2140 (2014) concernant le Yémen et Président du Groupe de travail informel sur la documentation et les autres questions de procédure. 

Face aux difficultés présentées par la situation politique précaire au Yémen, M. Bessho a salué le Groupe d’expert du Comité 2140, qui s’est selon lui montré très actif en présentant de nombreuses études de cas utiles. Le Président a souligné qu’il avait tout fait pour garantir l’indépendance et le bon fonctionnement du Groupe d’expert. Il a appelé le prochain président du Comité 2140 à tenter de réaliser une visite au Yémen, chose qu’il n’a pas été en mesure de faire durant son mandat, en raison de la situation difficile dans le pays.

S’agissant de son mandat à la tête du Groupe de travail informel sur la documentation et les autres questions de procédure, M. Bessho a indiqué avoir axé ses travaux sur une plus grande ouverture pour faciliter la sélection des présidents des organes subsidiaires. Il a également engagé un processus permettant de faciliter le passage de flambeau entre les présidents des comités sortants et les nouveaux présidents, dans le cadre de la révision de la note 507, adoptée en juillet 2010 par le Conseil pour améliorer ses méthodes de travail. 

Selon M. Bessho, la note 507 révisée est désormais un texte « équilibré et complet », « fruit d’un travail collectif ». Mais, selon lui, la révision de cette note doit rester un processus continu. Il a notamment appelé le Conseil à se pencher sur l’amélioration de la gestion des questions sur lesquelles devraient se focaliser les membres du Conseil un jour avant la tenue de consultations officieuses, ainsi que sur la gestion des éléments d’information portés à l’attention de la presse par le Conseil.

2367309,"Grands Lacs : les États signataires de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération doivent honorer leurs engagements, demande le Conseil de sécurité - résolution 2389 (2017) CS/13108

CONSEIL DE SÉCURITÉ  
8125E SÉANCE – MATIN

Le Conseil de sécurité a, ce matin, demandé de nouveau à tous les États signataires de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la République démocratique du Congo (RDC) et la région de redoubler d’efforts pour honorer leurs engagements, notamment ceux consistant « à s’abstenir de toute ingérence dans les affaires intérieures des pays voisins, à ne pas tolérer de groupes armés ni à leur fournir une assistance et à ne pas héberger de criminels de guerre ».

En adoptant à l’unanimité de ses 15 membres la [résolution 2389 (2017)](https://www.un.org/fr/documents/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2389(2017)), le Conseil s’est félicité de l’engagement renouvelé pris le 19 octobre 2017, lors de la huitième réunion de haut niveau du Mécanisme régional de suivi, qui s’est tenue à Brazzaville, en République du Congo, par tous les États signataires de l’Accord-cadre d’assurer sa mise en œuvre intégrale.

Le texte adopté aujourd’hui demande notamment au Gouvernement congolais, « à qui incombe au premier chef la responsabilité de protéger la souveraineté et l’intégrité territoriale » de la RDC, de s’employer « encore plus » à s’acquitter de ses engagements, notamment ceux qui concernent « la réforme du secteur de la sécurité, la consolidation de l’autorité de l’État, la réconciliation, la tolérance et la démocratisation ».

Il est par ailleurs demandé à ce gouvernement de s’employer « énergiquement » à neutraliser tous les groupes armés encore actifs dans l’est de la RDC, en soulignant la nécessité de protéger la population civile notamment en se dotant de « forces de sécurité professionnelles, responsables et pérennes » et en prônant la conduite d’opérations dans le strict respect du droit international.

La résolution exige en outre que tous les groupes armés opérant en RDC, « notamment les Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda, les Forces démocratiques alliées et l’Armée de résistance du Seigneur », mettent « immédiatement fin » à toutes les violences, y compris à l’exploitation des ressources naturelles, et que leurs membres soient « immédiatement et définitivement » démobilisés, déposent les armes et libèrent les enfants qui se trouvent dans leurs rangs.

Les Gouvernements de l’Ouganda, de la RDC et du Rwanda sont priés de renforcer leur collaboration afin d’assurer le rapatriement des ex-combattants du M23 se trouvant sur leurs territoires respectifs, et les chefs de l’ex-M23 exhortés à offrir leur entière coopération à cette fin.

Soulignant le « lien entre déplacement forcé et instabilité et insécurité dans la région », le Conseil se déclare préoccupé par la hausse sensible du nombre de déplacements au cours de l’année écoulée dans la région des Grands Lacs, qui compte actuellement plus de 7 millions de déplacés et 3,5 millions de réfugiés.

Rappelant les dispositions du Cadre stratégique régional pour la région des Grands Lacs 2016-2017, qui définissent l’action de développement des Nations Unies à l’appui de la mise en œuvre de l’Accord-cadre, la résolution exhorte la communauté des donateurs à contribuer à la mise en œuvre de ce Cadre stratégique. Celui-ci constitue en effet « un socle propice à des partenariats efficaces » permettant d’aider les États Membres concernés à s’acquitter des engagements qu’ils ont pris en vue de s’attaquer aux causes profondes des conflits, de promouvoir le développement et la coopération économiques, et d’assurer une paix durable dans la région des Grands Lacs.

Le représentant de l’Égypte, qui a présenté ce texte de résolution aux côtés de l’Éthiopie et du Sénégal, s’est félicité de son adoption à l’unanimité, qui démontre l’intérêt particulier du Conseil de sécurité pour la mise en œuvre de l’Accord-cadre par les 11 pays signataires, lesquels doivent s’acquitter de leurs obligations, en particulier l’élimination des groupes armés sur leurs territoires et le rapatriement des ex-combattants.

***LA SITUATION DANS LA RÉGION DES GRANDS LACS***

**Texte du projet de résolution (**S/2017/993)**

*Le Conseil de sécurité*,

*Prenant acte* du rapport du Secrétaire général sur la mise en œuvre de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la République démocratique du Congo et la région,

*Réaffirmant* son ferme attachement à la souveraineté, à l’indépendance, à l’unité et à l’intégrité territoriale de tous les États de la région, et *soulignant* que les principes de non-ingérence, de bon voisinage et de coopération régionale doivent être pleinement respectés,

*Rappelan*t que c’est aux gouvernements de la région qu’il incombe au premier chef de protéger les civils se trouvant sur leur territoire et relevant de leur juridiction, et notamment de les protéger des crimes contre l’humanité et des crimes de guerre,

*Se déclarant préoccupé* par l’augmentation sensible du nombre de réfugiés et de personnes déplacées au cours de l’année écoulée dans la région des Grands Lacs, qui compte actuellement plus de 7 millions de déplacés et 3,5 millions de réfugiés, et soulignant le lien entre le déplacement forcé et l’instabilité et l’insécurité dans la région,

*Se déclarant de nouveau profondément préoccupé* par l’insécurité et la crise humanitaire en République démocratique du Congo, qui sont aggravées par des activités déstabilisatrices de groupes armés étrangers et nationaux, *soulignant* combien il importe de neutraliser les groupes armés en République démocratique du Congo, et *soulignant* l’importance de l’action que mènent les Forces armées de République démocratique du Congo (FARDC) et la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo (MONUSCO), notamment en menant des opérations conjointes, conformément à son mandat tel qu’énoncé dans la résolution [2348 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2348(2017)),

*Se félicitant* que les élections organisées dans plusieurs pays de la région des Grands Lacs se sont déroulées dans le calme et dans des conditions garantissant leur crédibilité et *notant*, cependant, que les consultations électorales récentes et en cours dans certains pays de la région font sérieusement craindre une recrudescence de l’instabilité, de l’insécurité et des risques de violence, de violations des droits de l’homme et d’atteintes à ces droits et de violations du droit international humanitaire ainsi que de nouveaux déplacements de population, qui ont des répercussions sur l’ensemble des pays de la région des Grands Lacs,

*Se déclarant préoccupé* par les mouvements illicites d’armes tant à l’intérieur de la République démocratique du Congo qu’à destination de ce pays, y compris leurs transferts à des groupes armés ou entre groupes armés en violation de la résolution [2360 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2360(2017)), *se déclarant déterminé* à continuer de surveiller attentivement l’application de l’embargo sur les armes et des autres mesures qu’il a édictées dans ses résolutions concernant la République démocratique du Congo, et *sachant*, à cet égard, que l’embargo sur les armes qu’il a imposé joue un rôle notable dans la lutte contre le transfert illicite d’armes légères et de petit calibre en République démocratique du Congo et concourt à la consolidation de la paix au sortir du conflit, au désarmement, à la démobilisation et à la réintégration des ex-combattants et à la réforme du secteur de la sécurité,

*Exprimant* son inquiétude face à l’exploitation illégale et au trafic de ressources naturelles auxquels se livrent entre autres les groupes armés, et face aux conséquences néfastes des conflits armés sur les zones naturelles protégées, qui font obstacle à l’instauration d’une paix durable et au développement de la République démocratique du Congo, et *engageant* le Gouvernement de ce pays à redoubler d’efforts pour préserver ces zones,

*Rappelant* que les liens entre l’exploitation et le commerce illégaux des ressources naturelles, y compris le braconnage et le trafic d’espèces sauvages, et la prolifération et le trafic d’armes figurent parmi les principaux facteurs venant alimenter et exacerber les conflits dans la région des Grands Lacs, encourageant à poursuivre l’action que la Conférence internationale sur la région des Grands Lacs et les gouvernements intéressés mènent à l’échelon régional pour lutter contre l’exploitation illégale des ressources naturelles, et *soulignant* à cet égard l’importance que revêtent la coopération régionale et le renforcement de l’intégration économique, particulièrement en ce qui concerne l’exploitation des ressources naturelles,

*Réaffirmant* que l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération reste un mécanisme essentiel pour instaurer une paix et une stabilité durables en République démocratique du Congo et dans la région, *notant* et *soutenant* l’engagement renouvelé de ses signataires d’assurer sa mise en œuvre intégrale, et *demandant de nouveau* à tous les signataires d’honorer rapidement, intégralement et en toute bonne foi les engagements qu’ils ont pris dans l’Accord-cadre en vue de remédier aux causes profondes du conflit, de mettre fin aux cycles récurrents de violence et de promouvoir un développement régional durable,

*Rappelant* l’importance stratégique que revêt la mise en œuvre de l’Accord-cadre, se *félicitant* de l’engagement pris par le Conseil de paix et de sécurité de l’Union africaine, dans son communiqué du 7 novembre 2017, d’assurer l’application dudit accord, et *faisant écho* à l’appel que le Conseil a lancé à tous les États signataires et aux garants de l’Accord-cadre, leur demandant de redoubler d’efforts pour assurer l’application effective de toutes les dispositions de cet instrument,

*Rappelant* que, dans l’Accord-cadre, tous les États de la région se sont engagés à s’abstenir de toute ingérence dans les affaires intérieures des pays voisins, à ne pas tolérer de groupes armés ni à leur fournir une assistance ou un appui de quelque nature que ce soit et à ne pas héberger de criminels de guerre, et *condamnant de nouveau* énergiquement tout appui apporté de l’intérieur ou de l’extérieur aux groupes armés opérant dans la région, qu’il soit financier, logistique ou militaire,

*Soulignant* que le Pacte de 2006 sur la sécurité, la stabilité et le développement dans la région des Grands Lacs et l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la République démocratique du Congo et la région sont des instruments qui se renforcent mutuellement et qui sont indispensables pour assurer la paix et la prospérité à long terme, et *insistant* sur le fait que l’Accord-cadre établit clairement que la paix, la sécurité et le développement sont étroitement liés et qu’il importe de renforcer la coopération régionale, notamment l’intégration économique,

*Conscient* qu’une perspective régionale devrait permettre de trouver des solutions à la situation qui règne dans la région des Grands Lacs en traitant les causes profondes des conflits, dont beaucoup sont de nature régionale, y compris leurs aspects ayant trait au développement, les questions transfrontalières liées à la situation dans l’est de la République démocratique du Congo revêtant une importance cruciale en raison du déplacement d’un grand nombre de migrants et de réfugiés qu’elles provoquent, de l’importance du trafic de ressources naturelles et des activités de groupes armés et de réseaux criminels des deux côtés de la frontière,

1. *Se félicite* de l’engagement renouvelé pris par tous les États signataires de l’Accord-cadre d’assurer sa mise œuvre intégrale dans le communiqué publié à l’issue de la huitième réunion de haut niveau du Mécanisme régional de suivi, tenue à Brazzaville, en République du Congo, le 19 octobre 2017, *réaffirme* que l’Accord-cadre reste un mécanisme essentiel pour instaurer une paix et une stabilité durables en République démocratique du Congo et dans la région, et *souligne* à cet égard combien il importe que les États signataires honorent intégralement les engagements nationaux et régionaux qu’il ont pris dans l’Accord-cadre;

2. *Se félicite* *également* des progrès accomplis en exécution du Plan d’action régional pour la mise en œuvre des engagements régionaux pris dans l’Accord-cadre, notamment les activités récemment menées en faveur des jeunes et des femmes, la lutte contre l’exploitation illégale des ressources naturelles et la coopération judiciaire, ainsi que de l’approbation de la liste actualisée des activités prioritaires du Plan d’action régional;

3. *Encourage* tous les États signataires de l’Accord-cadre à intensifier leur coopération, avec l’appui des garants de l’Accord, à savoir l’Union africaine, la Conférence internationale sur la région des Grands Lacs, la Communauté de développement de l’Afrique australe et l’Organisation des Nations Unies, en vue de la mise œuvre intégrale de cet instrument;

4. *Condamne fermement* tous les groupes armés opérant dans la région et les violations du droit international humanitaire et d’autres normes applicables du droit international ainsi que les atteintes aux droits de l’homme qu’ils commettent, notamment les attaques contre la population civile, les soldats de la paix de la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo et le personnel humanitaire, les exécutions sommaires, les violences sexuelles et sexistes et le recrutement massif et l’emploi d’enfants, et *réaffirme* que les auteurs de tels actes devraient avoir à en répondre;

5. *Exige* que tous les groupes armés opérant en République démocratique du Congo, notamment les Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda, les Forces démocratiques alliées et l’Armée de résistance du Seigneur, mettent immédiatement fin à toutes les formes de violence et aux autres activités déstabilisatrices, y compris à l’exploitation des ressources naturelles, et que leurs membres soient immédiatement et définitivement démobilisés, déposent les armes et libèrent les enfants qui se trouvent dans leurs rangs, *rappelle* à cet égard sa résolution [2360 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2360(2017)), dans laquelle il a reconduit le régime de sanctions, et *demande* le désarmement des dirigeants et combattants actifs des Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda qui ont participé au génocide de 1994 visant les Tutsi au Rwanda, au cours duquel des opposants au génocide, d’origine hutu ou autre, ont également été tués, et qui ont continué de promouvoir et commettre, au Rwanda et en République démocratique du Congo, des meurtres à motivation ethnique ou autre;

6. *Demande de nouveau* à tous les États signataires de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la République démocratique du Congo et la région de redoubler d’efforts pour honorer pleinement et rapidement leurs engagements, en toute bonne foi, notamment ceux consistant à s’abstenir de toute ingérence dans les affaires intérieures des pays voisins, à ne pas tolérer de groupes armés ni à leur fournir une assistance ou un appui de quelque nature que ce soit et à ne pas héberger de criminels de guerre ; et *demande*au Gouvernement de la République démocratique du Congo, à qui incombe au premier chef la responsabilité de protéger la souveraineté et l’intégrité territoriale du pays, de s’employer encore plus à s’acquitter des engagements qu’il a pris au titre de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la République démocratique du Congo et la région, notamment ceux qui concernent la réforme du secteur de la sécurité, la consolidation de l’autorité de l’État, la réconciliation, la tolérance et la démocratisation ;

7. *Demande également* au Gouvernement de la République démocratique du Congo, agissant avec l’appui des pays de la région conformément aux engagements qu’ils ont pris au titre de l’Accord-cadre, et en étroite collaboration avec la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo, notamment dans le cadre d’opérations conjointes menées conformément au mandat de la Mission tel qu’énoncé dans la résolution [2348 (2017)](https://undocs.org/fr/S/RES/2348(2017)), de s’employer énergiquement à neutraliser tous les groupes armés encore actifs dans l’est de la République démocratique du Congo, et *souligne* qu’il faut protéger la population civile notamment en se dotant de forces de sécurité professionnelles, responsables et pérennes et que ces opérations doivent être conduites dans le strict respect du droit international, notamment le droit international humanitaire et le droit international des droits de l’homme, selon qu’il conviendra;

8. *Se félicite* de l’engagement pris par les États signataires de l’Accord-cadre d’achever, sans condition préalable et dans les meilleurs délais, le rapatriement des combattants désarmés des Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda et des combattants de l’ex-M23, *invite instamment* les gouvernements des pays de la région à renforcer, avec l’appui des garants de l’Accord-cadre, leur collaboration en vue de respecter le calendrier convenu;

9. *Prie* les Gouvernements de l’Ouganda, de la République démocratique du Congo et du Rwanda de renforcer leur collaboration afin d’assurer le rapatriement des ex-combattants du M23 se trouvant sur leurs territoires, conformément aux déclarations de Nairobi et aux engagements pris au titre de l’Accord-cadre, *invite*les garants dudit Accord-cadre à poursuivre leur dialogue avec les parties prenantes dans la perspective d’une reprise des consultations conjointes entre le Gouvernement de la République démocratique du Congo et les chefs de l’ex-M23 engagées en 2016 sous leurs auspices et *exhorte* les chefs de l’ex-M23 à offrir leur entière coopération en vue du rapatriement des ex-combattants conformément aux engagements qu’ils ont pris dans la Déclaration de Nairobi;

10. *Demande à nouveau* que soit trouvée une façon appropriée de procéder à la réinstallation des éléments du Mouvement/Armée populaire de libération du Soudan dans l’opposition qui sont actuellement présents sur le territoire congolais, *se félicite* de l’esprit de collaboration manifesté par les Gouvernements de la République démocratique du Congo et du Soudan du Sud et des progrès accomplis jusqu’à présent dans ce domaine avec le soutien de la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo et du Bureau de l’Envoyé spécial du Secrétaire général pour la région des Grands Lacs, et *demande* à tous les acteurs régionaux et à la communauté internationale de soutenir ces efforts;

11. *Salue* les efforts déployés par l’Union africaine, ainsi que les organisations sous-régionales, en particulier la Communauté économique des États de l’Afrique centrale, la Communauté d’Afrique de l’Est, la Conférence internationale sur la Région des Grands Lacs et la Communauté de développement de l’Afrique australe, en vue de soutenir les processus politiques et de trouver des solutions pacifiques aux situations de conflit dans la région;

12. *Exhorte* les États de la région et la communauté internationale à appuyer les initiatives destinées à promouvoir un dialogue sans exclusive entre les parties prenantes nationales, et *souligne* qu’il importe d’ouvrir l’espace politique pour permettre aux partis politiques pacifiques, à la société civile et aux médias de participer pleinement et librement au processus politique, ainsi que pour assurer la pleine participation tant des hommes que des femmes à ce processus, *demande instamment* aux États de la région et à la communauté internationale d’appuyer le renforcement et l’amélioration des capacités en matière d’élections et de gouvernance des pays de la région des Grands Lacs, et *demande* aux États Membres de la région des Grands Lacs de prendre des mesures pour garantir que les consultations électorales favorisent la paix et la sécurité, en faisant en sorte que les élections aient lieu en temps voulu et se déroulent de façon pacifique, ouverte à tous et crédible, conformément aux constitutions respectives des pays et à la Charte africaine de la démocratie, des élections et de la gouvernance, selon le cas ;

On trouvera ci-après le texte de la déclaration à la presse faite, le 8 décembre, par le Président du Conseil de sécurité pour le mois de décembre, M. Koro Bessho (Japon):

Les membres du Conseil de sécurité ont condamné dans les termes les plus énergiques l’attaque menée contre la base opérationnelle de compagnie de la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo (MONUSCO) à Semuliki (Nord-Kivu) le 7 décembre 2017, qui a causé la mort de 15 Casques bleus tanzaniens et blessé au moins 53 autres, et au cours de laquelle, cinq membres des Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo ont également été tués.

Les membres du Conseil ont exprimé leurs sincères condoléances et leur sympathie aux familles des victimes, ainsi qu’aux gouvernements de la Tanzanie et de la République démocratique du Congo et à la MONUSCO. Ils ont souhaité un prompt rétablissement aux soldats de la paix blessés.

Les membres du Conseil ont condamné dans les termes les plus vifs toutes les attaques et provocations dirigées par des groupes armés contre la MONUSCO. Ils ont souligné que les attaques délibérées visant des soldats de la paix peuvent constituer des crimes de guerre au regard du droit international. Il ne saurait y avoir d’impunité pour de tels actes. Ils ont appelé le Gouvernement de la République démocratique du Congo à veiller à ce que les auteurs de ces attaques soient traduits en justice sans délai. Ils ont à nouveau exigé que tous les groupes armés cessent immédiatement toute forme de violence.

Les membres du Conseil ont rendu hommage aux soldats de la paix qui risquent leur vie jour après jour au service de la paix mondiale et de la protection des civils. Cette attaque, la pire perpétrée contre des soldats de la paix des Nations Unies au cours des dernières années, vient rappeler les sacrifices extraordinaires consentis par ces braves femmes et hommes chaque jour.

Les membres du Conseil ont réaffirmé leur plein appui au Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général en République démocratique du Congo et à la MONUSCO dans le cadre de l’exécution intégrale de leur mandat.

2367244,"R.D.Congo – Bas-Uélé, Haut-Uélé, Ituri & Tshopo : Note d’informations humanitaires no 20 (7/12/2017) **Faits saillants**

- Plus de 30 000 personnes de la région d’Opienge contraintes au déplacement.

- Plus de 25 000 élèves ciblés par la cantine scolaire dans les territoires d’Irumu et de Mambasa.

- Une aide multisectorielle de TROCAIRE pour les réfugiés et les communautés hôtes. 

**Aperçu de la situation** 

Selon Caritas Kisangani, six des 15 aires de santé de la Zone de santé d’Opienge (342 km à l’est de Kisangani) se sont vidées de leurs populations estimées à plus de 30 000 personnes, depuis le 30 novembre dernier. Ce déplacement fait suite aux affrontements entre les Mayi-Mayi et l’armée congolaise. Une partie de la population a trouvé refuge en brousse tandis qu’une autre s’est déplacée vers la localité de Bafwasende (environ 90 km d’Opienge) et des villages situés sur la route menant à Kisangani. A ces jours, plus de 12 000 personnes seraient arrivées à Bafwasende et d’autres localités périphériques. La population totale d’Opienge s’élève à 66 121 habitants ; la zone demeure encore instable et l’on craint de nouveaux combats. A la suite de ce contexte d’insécurité, on signale des problèmes humanitaires tels que le manque d’abris, articles ménagers essentiels, de nourriture auxquels s’ajoutent des difficultés d’accès aux soins de santé pour les déplacés dans les lieux de refuge.    

L’ONG Caritas a déployé une équipe à Bafwasende pour une évaluation de la situation humanitaire. Entre temps, Solidarités International collecte les données pour une éventuelle évaluation multisectorielle rapide. Opienge, une zone très enclavée dans la Province de la Tshopo, avait accueilli plus de 28 000 personnes déplacées en juin 2016 en provenance de nombreux villages. [Le Coordonnateur humanitaire avait alloué plus de 3 millions de dollars pour une réponse multisectorielle à cette crise](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/system/files/documents/files/ocha-bas-uele_haut-uele_ituri_et_tshopo_-_note_dinformations_humanitaires_du_18_novembre_2016.pdf). Ce programme d’assistance a pris fin en novembre.    

Selon la ministre provinciale de la Santé, l’Ituri compte, au troisième trimestre de cette année, 12 981 personnes vivant avec le VIH/SIDA dont 8 801 sont sous traitement anti rétro viraux. Les autorités notent aussi qu’à cause de la prévalence élevée du VIH et de la tuberculose, l’Ituri est classé parmi les 14 provinces du pays à haute priorité où les activités doivent être concentrées. En dépit des efforts considérables et les progrès accomplis, cette épidémie ne cesse de persister dans la province en raison notamment de la faible implication des différents acteurs et parties prenantes. En vue de renverser la tendance, les autorités sollicitent les acteurs impliqués dans la lutte contre le VIH/SIDA à mettre en œuvre des programmes mieux coordonnés, qui mobilisent la contribution de tous
pour une riposte commune, élargie et efficace.",268,"French"

communautaires à l’éducation des réfugiés au Tchad Par Nestor Masdé Heindaye    
Snr Education Assistant 

La salle de conférence du HCR à N’Djamena a abrité du 22 au 23 novembre 2017 la dernière réunion nationale de coordination des acteurs du secteur de l’éducation de l’année 2017. 

Elle a été spécialement combinée à l’atelier sur l’harmonisation des contributions communautaires à l’éducation des réfugiés au Tchad. Ouvrant les travaux, l’administrateur principale en charge de la protection du HCR, M. Boniface Macharia Kinyanjui, a rappelé, à dessein, que « les communautés réfugiées et autochtones ont de plus en plus de responsabilités à assumer et à assurer pour une éducation de qualité, équitable et inclusive ». 

Durant les deux jours facilités par l’administrateur associé à l’éducation du HCR M. Yanik YANKEU Y., les trente-cinq (35) participants parmi lesquels des représentants des réfugiés venus des différents camps de l’Est, du Sud et du Lac ont échangé sur des questions importantes liées aux frais scolaires, aux constructions à base communautaire, à la participation communautaire au AGR/école et aux études supérieures. La rencontre a également connu la participation des cadres du Ministère de l’Education Nationale et de la Promotion, des responsables de la société civile, d’un représentant du bailleur de fonds BPRM, des partenaires techniques du HCR et des points focaux de l’éducation des différents bureaux du HCR. 

Lors de la restitution des travaux de groupe, le point relatif aux frais de scolarité a suscité beaucoup d’intérêts. Des échanges riches et constructifs qui ont débouché sur 13 recommandations dont celle relative aux frais de scolarité. Ainsi, il a été recommandé d’appliquer, dans les écoles des camps/sites de réfugiés, dès la rentrée scolaire 2018/2019 la note circulaire N°011/PR/PM/MENFP/SEENCEFA/SG/DGEFS/2015 du 05 Novembre 2015 qui règlemente et fixe les frais scolaires, communément appelé frais d’Association des Parents d’Elèves (APE), à 1 000 XAF par élève et par an au primaire. Les frais d’inscription des enfants à besoins spécifiques seront directement versés aux APE par le HCR via ses partenaires en cash transfert. 

Pour mémoire, c’est un heureux dénouement d’un long processus qui a été entamé au mois d’août 2017 par des réunions préparatoires puis une évaluation participative d’août à septembre 2017 dans tous les camps de réfugiés sur les différents aspects de la contribution communautaire. 

La Représentation du HCR au Tchad à l’instar de l’ensemble des acteurs humanitaires est résolument engagée sur la voie de la transition de l’urgence vers le développement. 

Enclenché depuis 2012 sous l’impulsion du gouvernement du Tchad en collaboration avec le système des Nations Unies, ce processus a déjà permis l’intégration de certains services sociaux de base dont l’éducation par les écoles des camps de réfugiés de l’Est du Tchad. 

L’harmonisation des contributions communautaires permettrait à terme de réduire les cas d’enfants hors système éducatif et aux communautés réfugiées de jouer un rôle prépondérant dans la gestion de l’éducation.",268,"French"

L’activité qui s’inscrit dans le cadre de la sécurisation du processus électoral a comme objectif de susciter l’implication des policières et des organisations féminines dans le cadre de la collecte de renseignements pour l’efficacité de la lutte contre l’insécurité et la non-violence au cours du processus électoral dans la ville de LUBUMBASHI.

Dans son exposé, la Cheffe secteur UNPOL, UNPOL DOAMBA Clémence s’est appesantie sur les potentialités de la femme en maintien de l’ordre public. Elle dira que la population a besoin d’une police plus préventive que répressive et en la matière, les policières peuvent bien s’y prêter. Elle a aussi mis l’accent sur la contribution des femmes à tous les stades des processus de règlement des conflits, de rétablissement et de consolidation de la paix, de maintien de l’ordre public et de reconstruction. Selon elle, il n’y aura pas de paix durable sans la participation pleine et égale des femmes et des hommes. Elle a ainsi suggéré la création d’un partenariat entre la Police de la MONUSCO, la PNC, les organisations féminines et la société civile afin d’aider les autorités policières et administratives à collecter les renseignements nécessaires en vue de relever les défis sécuritaires à LUBUMBASHI, en cette période pré-électorale.

2366134,"Les attaques contre les humanitaires persistent en Centrafrique *Bangui, le 8 décembre 2017* – La communauté humanitaire en République centrafricaine continue de payer un lourd tribut à la hausse de la criminalité dans les régions du Nord, du Sud et du Sud-Est. A Kabo dans la préfecture de l’Ouham (Nord), depuis le 8 décembre, plusieurs Organisations nongouvernementales ont été contraintes de suspendre temporairement leurs activités en raison d’agressions ciblées et un humanitaire y a trouvé la mort le 7 décembre.  

Le Chef du Bureau de la Coordination des Affaires humanitaires (OCHA) en République centrafricaine, Joseph Inganji, a condamné avec la dernière énergie « ces nouvelles attaques qui non seulement violent le Droit international mais aussi privent les plus vulnérables de la présence de ceux qui les rapprochent chaque jour de la résilience ». En effet, le retrait des acteurs humanitaires dans la région de Kabo privera plus de 100 000 personnes d’une assistance humanitaire multiforme et vitale.  

L’impact de ce nouveau pic de criminalité se traduit par une multiplication alarmante des attaques des convois et des bases humanitaires induisant de lourdes pertes matérielles et en vies humaines. Depuis le début de l’année 2017, 14 humanitaires ont perdu la vie en Centrafrique. « De septembre à octobre 2017, la communauté humanitaire a dû suspendre ses activités dans plusieurs foyers de tension en raison d’attaques aussi criminelles qu’inconscientes et lâches dans la mesure où elles aggravent la détresse des plus vulnérables » a souligné le Chef d’OCHA.  

Cette tendance déplorable survient alors que la situation humanitaire dans le pays demeure très inquiétante. L’Aperçu des besoins humanitaires prévoit que plus de 2,5 millions de personnes auront besoin d’une assistance en 2018. « Un accès rapide et sans entrave aux populations est la condition sine qua none et non négociable pour pouvoir répondre aux besoins dans un pays qui figure parmi les plus dangereux pour les travailleurs humanitaires » a indiqué Joseph Inganji. « Je tiens à rappeler que l’accès est aussi important pour les humanitaires que pour les acteurs du développement. Ils ont besoin de conditions minimales de sécurité afin de continuer à sauver des vies et alléger les souffrances en République centrafricaine » a rappelé le Chef d’OCHA.

2365759,"5579 rapatriés et 409 retournés haïtiens enregistrés à la frontière au cours du mois de novembre 2017 Spécial Les autorités de la migration dominicaine continuent avec les opérations de rapatriement d’Haïtiens à la frontière haïtiano-dominicaine. Au cours du mois de novembre 2017, 5579 personnes rapatriées ont été enregistrées au niveau des quatre points frontaliers officiels haïtiano-dominicains. 417 autres dont 8 rapatriés et 409 retournés spontanés ont été aussi recensés à Cornillon/Grand-Bois. Parmi les personnes rapatriées, figurent 4909 hommes, 591 femmes et 79 mineurs (8 fillettes et 71 garçonnets).

La plupart des migrants rapatriés ont vécu en République Dominicaine pendant de nombreuses années. Ils travaillaient dans le secteur agricole, la restauration et dans le domaine de la construction.

Certains d’entre eux ont souligné avoir été reconduits en Haïti bien qu’ils soient en possession de visa dominicain valide. Tel a été le cas de deux ressortissants haïtiens dont un étudiant en génie civil. Ce dernier a indiqué avoir été brutalement intercepté à Santo Domingo et rapatrié à Carisal/Comendador (Elias Piña), le 21 novembre 2017.

Les migrants haïtiens ont dénoncé les conditions dans lesquelles ils ont été gardés dans les centres carcéraux dominicains avant d’être reconduits à la frontière.

Ils se sont plaints d’avoir été contraints de dormir à même le sol pendant leur incarcération sans avoir accès à l’eau potable et à la nourriture.

Certains d’entre eux se sont vu confisquer leurs objets importants : montres, téléphones portables et autres articles de valeur.

Ils ont fait état des biens qu’ils ont laissés en République Dominicaine après de longues années de travail en territoire voisin.

Soulignons que le point frontalier Ouanaminthe/Dajabon (Nord-est) est celui ayant accueilli le plus grand nombre de migrants rapatriés avec un effectif de 3491 personnes.  

Le point frontalier Carisal/Comendador (Centre) vient en deuxième position avec 2054 personnes suivi de Malpasse/Jimani (Ouest) avec 26 personnes. 

Huit personnes rapatriés ont été aussi recensées à Savane Bombe/ Cacica, un point frontalier non officiel de la commune de Cornillon/Grand-Bois. 409 autres sont revenues en Haïti de manière spontanée.

Il convient de rappeler que de juillet 2015 au 21 septembre 2017, 229885 migrants haïtiens qui vivaient en République Dominicaine ont été contraints de rentrer en Haïti. Parmi lesquels 133672 retournés spontanés et 96213 rapatriés ont été enregistrés. De ce nombre figurent 4087 mineurs non accompagnés.

Dans un communiqué, le ministère précise que cette mission a été menée en coordination avec le ministère des Affaires étrangères et de la Coopération Internationale, à travers la Direction des affaires consulaires et sociales et avec les parties compétentes, notant que cette dernière s'est rendue sur les lieux en vue d'entreprendre toutes les procédures préliminaires afin d'identifier les personnes bloquées dans cette zone.

2365619,"Un an après Mathieu, Haïti s’engage à relancer l’agriculture durable dans les Nippes et la région goâvienne Port-au-Prince, mardi 21 novembre 2017 – Le Ministère de l’Agriculture, des ressources naturelles et du développement rural (MARNDR) avec ces partenaires financiers et technique, Le Fonds international pour le développement agricole (FIDA) et le Programme des Nations Unies pour le développement (PNUD) ont conjointement lancé, dans la plaine de Baconnois le mardi 21 novembre 2017, les travaux du projet de développement de la petite irrigation et de l’accès aux marchés dans les Nippes et la région Goâvienne (PPI-3).

Sur une durée de 24 mois, le projet s’attèlera au développement et/ou à la réhabilitation de 14 périmètres irrigués totalisant plus de 1500 hectares de surfaces cultivables pour une population de 6000 agricultrices et agriculteurs. S’inscrivant dans une démarche intégrée, l’initiative mettra également l’emphase sur l’aménagement des bassins versants contribuant ainsi à la protection des points d’eau et sources, le renouvellement de la nappe phréatique et la limitation de l’érosion et la sédimentation.

Visant l’accroissement, la sécurisation durables des revenus et des conditions de vie des ménages ruraux pauvres, ce projet financé à hauteur de 11,5 millions par le Fonds international pour le développement agricole (FIDA) bénéficiera directement aux communes suivantes : Miragoâne, Petite rivière de Nippes, Anse-à-veau, Grand-Gave et Petit-Goâve avec une emphase mise sur les femmes pauvres cheffes de ménages et les jeunes.

Pour la Directrice Adjointe du PNUD, Martine Thérer qui participait au lancement des travaux du projet PPI-3, « Le développement de l’agriculture est un des leviers les plus puissants pour mettre fin à l’extrême pauvreté, mieux partager la prospérité et assurer la sécurité alimentaire de tous les habitants de la planète. »

Avec cette initiative, le MARNDR avec l’appui financier du FIDA et celui technique du PNUD contribueront à répondre à l’extrême précarité des conditions d’existence des populations rurales des zones ciblées, lesquelles constituent des axes privilégiés de transit et d’échanges commerciaux et économiques entre l’Ouest (notamment la capitale haïtienne), le Sud Est, le Sud et la Grand-Anse qui ont été sévèrement frappé par le cyclone Mathieu en octobre 2016.

Le projet PPI-3 contribue en termes de réponses aux effets du cyclone Mathieu qui a détruit les infrastructures de production de base dans le domaine agricole notamment les systèmes d’irrigation. Cette catastrophe a fragilisé les petit(es) agriculteurs (trices) qui peinent encore aujourd’hui après plus d’un an à se relever. Il faut rappeler que Mathieu a causé des dommages et pertes estimés à 573,3 millions de dollars US, représentant 31 % du produit intérieur brut agricole (PIBA) ou 7% du Produit intérieur brut (PIB). PPI-3 rentre dans le cadre des actions à moyens termes préconisés par le Gouvernement haïtien pour renforcer les acquis des interventions à court terme et redynamiser la production agricole dans les zones affectées pour les trois prochaines années.

Intervenant à cette cérémonie de lancement, le titulaire du MARNDR, Marie Carmel André Belliard a salué l’engagement de la population pour la pleine réussite de ce projet.

Il a par ailleurs insisté sur le fait que des projets de lois sont déjà élaborées pour mieux gérer les questions liées à la production et la commercialisation des semences dans une perspective de protection des agriculteurs et agricultrices.

Tout au cours de sa mise en œuvre, le projet contribuera à l’augmentation durable de la production agricole tout en appliquant des pratiques modernes et respectueuses de l’environnement conformément aux objectifs de développement durable (ODD) en particulier les objectifs *1 1, 2, 12 et 15. Durant sa mise en œuvre, le projet appuiera l’approvisionnement des agriculteurs en intrants agricoles de base (semences, fertilisants, pesticides, etc.) avec une préférence pour la fertilisation organique. Pour la campagne agricole d’hiver, le projet procédera à la distribution de plus de 2350 tonnes de semences au bénéfice de plus de 4000 agriculteurs et agricultrices. Le projet mettra également à disposition des bénéficiaires des équipements et outils agricoles adéquats pour une relance de la production agricole dans les Nippes et la région goâvienne. 

Pour une meilleure appropriation des techniques agricoles modernes, le projet mettra en place 60 Champs-écoles agricoles (CEA) où les jeunes hommes et femmes pourront renforcer leurs capacités et jouer le rôle de relais pour vulgariser les meilleures techniques en la matière.

Les premiers éléments d’information recueillis par la Caritas-Développement Kisangani font état de multiples besoins humanitaires enregistrés dans cette zone. Dans un rapport succinct daté du 03 décembre 2017, ce bureau diocésain de Caritas Congo Asbl plaide alors pour une intervention multisectorielle urgente de la part des autorités publiques compétentes et de la Communauté humanitaire.

« Cette situation a provoqué le déplacement de plus de 19.000 personnes, soit 3.200 ménages. Si la plupart ont fui vers Kisangani et Bafwasende, d’autres se dirigent vers le Maniema ou le Sud-Kivu. A considérer les ménages encore en fuite dans la brousse, il est fort probable que ce déplacement concerne près de 5.000 familles », a déploré ce vendredi l’Abbé Udaga Néné, contacté au téléphone par caritasdev.cd.

Située à 140 km du chef-lieu du territoire de Bafwasende et à 342 km de la ville de Kisangani, la cité d’Opienge est habitée par les Barumbi et les Bakumu qui sont des populations autochtones. Totalement enclavé, le poste d’encadrement d’Opienge qui s’étend à plus de 180 km en pleine forêt équatoriale avec une population d’environ 66.121 habitants, dispose de l’un de Parcs nationaux les plus riches et de l’un de plus importants gisements des minerais de la RDC. Les infrastructures routières totalement dégradées, il n’y a pas de moyens de communication viables, pas d’infrastructures scolaires et sanitaires adéquates.

Les affrontements du mois de juin-septembre 2016 qui ont opposé les deux groupes des miliciens Mai-Mai de Monsieur Luc Yabili contre Monsieur Guidon de Oninga de la province de Nord-Kivu dans les foyers miniers d’Opienge ont occasionné le déplacement des populations vers Balobe, Babomongo, Basaula, Angamapasa. Les déplacés ont été assistés par les ONG internationales et nationales de janvier à novembre 2017. Se croyant victimes de la situation, les Kumus voulaient à ce que toute l’assistance soit orientée vers eux à Balobe au lieu d’Opienge, village qu’ils pensent être des Barumbi.

C’est ainsi que les Kumu vont revendiquer leur part de l’aide et menacer de détruire tout ce que les ONG ont laissé à Opienge. En effet, les humanitaires avaient procédé à la distribution des articles ménagers essentiels, réfectionné, aménagé et équipé certaines infrastructures à Opienge et ses environs.

C’est ainsi que, le 30 novembre 2017, après avoir occupé un mois durant les villages Balobe, Angamapasa, et Babobongo, ce sera le tour d’Opienge-centre (12.022 habitants). Ce poste administratif est passé sous contrôle d’un groupe Maï-Maï, le jeudi 30 novembre 2017 à 6h30 du matin, après un bref affrontement avec les Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC). L’objectif actuel de ces Maï-Maï, a indiqué notre source, serait de prendre le contrôle de la cité d’Opienge, d’abord pour réclamer leur dû auprès des organismes et ONG, ensuite, réaliser leur souci de toujours prendre le contrôle du parc de Maiko qu’ils considèrent comme leur patrimoine ancestral et passer à l’exploitation des matières premières.

**Des Aires de Santé pillées**

Selon les témoignages recueillis de la Zone de Santé, la population civile d’Opienge est constituée en grande partie des déplacés et des retournés depuis un certain temps. Plusieurs villages et champs ont été détruits et abandonnés. Six sur les 15 Aires de Santé qui composent la Zone de Santé d’Opienge ont été soit vidées de leur personnel, soit pillées ou détruites : Opienge-Centre (12.022 Habitants) ; Basaula (3.649 Hab.) ; Babomongo (3.705 Hab.) ; Anga Mapasa (4.386) ; Balobe (2.779) et Elongo (4.098).

Au niveau de Balobe où la situation a commencé, il a été signalé le pillage systématique des biens de la population et des commerçants de la place.

« Présentement, la Cité d’Opienge, vidée de sa population, est sous contrôle des Maï-Maï. Notre source nous signale qu’une partie de la population est dans la forêt et une autre repartie dans des villages tout au long de la route de sortie vers Kisangani et Bafwasende », soulignait dimanche la note de la Caritas Kisangani.

Il s’agit des villages environnants suivants : Babule (à 85 km de la grand-route), Ndrekoko (à 70 km de la grand-route), Babagulu (à 49 km) et Bafwabalinga (à 232 km de Kisangani).

**De multiples problèmes humanitaires enregistrés**

Cette situation est à la base de multiples problèmes humanitaires enregistrés dans la région, entre autres : des cas des violences sexuelles enregistrés dans la Zone de Santé, le manque d’abris pour de nombreuses familles déplacées, la désertion scolaire par les élèves, l’accès difficile aux soins médicaux et à l’eau potable, le surpeuplement des familles d’accueil, de nombreux enfants abandonnés et souffrant de la malnutrition ainsi que le manque de vêtements, de couvertures et nourriture.

« De tout ce qui précède, une intervention multisectorielle est souhaitée et serait la bienvenue », conclut la Caritas Kisangani.

2365464,"Mali : Face à la crise, faire le choix de la Justice **(Bamako) En amont de l’examen périodique universel du Mali devant les Nations Unies, la FIDH et l’AMDH publient aujourd’hui un nouveau rapport, analysant les moyens et actions déployés par la justice du pays pour lutter contre les crimes les plus graves. Revenant sur plusieurs affaires emblématiques, le rapport montre que certains dossiers ont connu des avancées significatives, grâce à la volonté et aux positions tenues par les autorités. D’autres affaires sont toutefois restées en souffrance, entravées par une situation sécuritaire fragile, le manque de moyens, ou parce que politiquement sensibles. Pour lutter efficacement contre le terrorisme et l’insécurité, la FIDH et l’AMDH appellent les autorités maliennes et les forces internationales à mettre la justice, le dialogue et le respect des droits humains au cœur de leurs actions. Et d’éviter ainsi de renouer avec les erreurs passées des stratégies du « tout sécuritaire »**.

Depuis 2012, le nord et le centre du Mali sont agités par un conflit ayant fait plusieurs milliers de victimes. Opposant l’État malien et des groupes armés terroristes, il a dégénéré en affrontements communautaires. Les deux dernières années ont vu une recrudescence des violences et attaques [1], et la perpétration de nouveaux crimes graves.

L’ampleur et la gravité des crimes en cours d’instruction ou de jugement sont inédits dans l’histoire contemporaine du pays. Nos organisations ont entendu plus de 500 victimes et témoins ces dernières années. Elles ont initié ou participé à une dizaine de procédures judiciaires, accompagnant plus de 180 parties civiles devant la justice. Le rapport publié aujourd’hui revient sur l’état d’avancement de plusieurs affaires emblématiques.

Les 12 derniers mois ont permis des avancées considérables, avec l’ouverture du procès de l’ex président putschiste Amadou Haya Sanogo et de ses complices, poursuivis pour l’exécution sommaire de plus de 20 « bérets rouges », et la condamnation par la justice malienne de l’ancien commissaire de la police islamique de Gao : Aliou Mahamane Touré. Par ailleurs, un pôle judiciaire spécialisé dans la lutte contre le terrorisme et une Commission vérité, justice et réconciliation ont été créés puis sont entrés en fonction en 2015.

**«Ces derniers mois, nous avons peut-être plus obtenus par la justice que ce qui fut obtenu par les armes : la reconnaissance des crimes des putschistes et des groupes armés. La paix se gagnera autant par le rétablissement de la sécurité qu’en répondant aux besoins de vérité, de justice et de réconciliation.»**   Me Moctar Mariko, président de l’AMDH

Toutefois, le rapport décrit aussi comment d’autres affaires n’ont toujours pas fait l’objet de procès. Comme les crimes sexuels perpétrés de manière systématique par les groupes djihadistes au Nord Mali en 2012-2013. Si des mandats d’arrêt ont été déposés et des dizaines de personnes arrêtées et inculpées en 2013, aucune n’a depuis été inquiétée, alors que ces crimes sont constitutifs de crimes de guerre et crimes contre l’humanité. En 2014 et 2015, nos organisations avaient déposé deux plaintes [2] avec constitution de partie civile, en représentation de plus d’une centaine de victimes. Plusieurs autres procédures sont dans l’attente de relance. Notamment celles concernant le massacre d’Agueloc (153 militaires maliens exécutés) ; la mutinerie de Kati ; les « disparus de Tombouctou » ou les autres crimes commis par toutes les forces en présence pendant la « reconquête du Nord » en 2013.

Le rapport plaide aussi pour que les enquêtes anti terroristes puissent inclure les graves violations des droits humains commises contre les populations.

Le contexte sécuritaire et politique ambivalent continue à peser sur les procédures judiciaires.

Ainsi, l’intensification des violences et attaques a des conséquences négatives. Elle empêche le retour d’un système judiciaire fonctionnel dans le nord et le centre [3], et pousse l’État à concentrer ses moyens sur les réponses sécuritaires et militaires. Par ailleurs, les accords passés pour obtenir la résolution politique du conflit – ou la libération d’otages - ont entraîné la libération ou l’abandon des poursuites à l’encontre d’individus soupçonnés de crimes graves [4] . Quant au procès Sanogo, il n’a toujours pas repris, un an jour pour jour après sa suspension pour vice de procédure dans la conduite des expertises médico-légales.

Enfin, si l’Accord de paix de juin 2015 consacre le caractère imprescriptible des crimes de guerre et crimes contre l’humanité, et la non amnistie pour leurs auteurs, sa mise en œuvre reste au point mort [5].

**«Si la lutte contre l’impunité n’est pas la seule réponse à apporter au conflit, il ne pourra y avoir de paix sans un minimum de justice. Les maliens attendent de leur justice qu’elle règle les différents, les protège de l’arbitraire des hommes en armes, et contribue ainsi à sortir leur pays de la crise qu’il endure depuis 2012.»**   Me Drissa Traoré, vice-président de la FIDH

**Notes**

[1] L’année 2016 avait connu une recrudescence des violences et attaques commises par les différents groupes armés à l’encontre des civils, des militaires maliens et de la Minusma. Nos organisations avaient comptabilisé au moins 385 attaques ayant coûté la vie à au moins 332 personnes dont 207 civils dans le nord et le centre du pays. À cela s’ajoutaient des actes de torture, des enlèvements, des détentions arbitraires et des extorsions de tous types, avec au moins 621 cas répertoriés.

[2] Le 12 novembre 2014, nos organisations ont déposé auprès du Tribunal de grande instance de la Commune III de Bamako une plainte avec constitution de partie civile pour crimes contre l’humanité et crimes de guerre au nom de 80 femmes et filles victimes de viols et autres formes de violences sexuelles. Cet acte a poussé la justice malienne à ouvrir une première procédure judiciaire concernant ces crimes sexuels. 
Le 6 mars 2015, à la suite d’enquêtes menées à Tombouctou et sa région, nos organisations ont déposé une nouvelle plainte avec constitution de partie civile au nom de 33 victimes de crimes internationaux, dont des crimes sexuels, commis lors de l’occupation de Tombouctou et sa région par les groupes armés en 2012 et 2013. Cette plainte vise nommément 15 auteurs présumés de crimes contre l’humanité et crimes de guerre.

[3] Si les tribunaux des régions de Tombouctou et Gao ont été réhabilités après l’occupation, ils peinent à être fonctionnels. Ils ne peuvent notamment pas, en raison de la situation sécuritaire et des menaces auxquelles font face les administrateurs de la justice, traiter des affaires qui mettent en cause des individus affiliés aux groupes armés.
le Procureur de Gao a échappé à une attaque à son domicile en janvier 2015. Le tribunal de Kidal n’est quant à lui toujours pas ouvert malgré la nomination d’un nouveau procureur qui siège à Gao.

Les territoires de Kabeya Kamwanga et Miabi dans la province du Kasaï-Oriental, ont été victimes des affrontements entre les forces de l’ordre et les miliciens du présumé Kamwena Nsampu, occasionnant des morts par balles, des viols des filles et des femmes, des arrestations arbitraires, des pillages de biens essentiels, des incendies de maisons et parfois de villages entiers, causant ainsi une grande panique et des déplacements massifs de population. Cette situation tragique a été à la base de la destruction de la production agricole, des infrastructures, des services sociaux de base et du tissu économique déjà précaire.

Dans leurs refuges, les populations privées de tout, n’avaient aucune assistance depuis plusieurs mois et les ménages commençaient à enregistrer des décès dus aux maladies, à la famine et aux morsures de serpents. Devant l’ampleur de la situation sécuritaire, les prestataires de soins ne résidant plus dans les lieux d’affectation, n’acceptaient plus d’y retourner et par conséquent, l’implémentation des activités des services sociaux de base et les interventions des partenaires étaient rendues impossibles.

**Retour dans leurs lieux d’affectation**  

La seule option possible pour améliorer la situation était de convaincre les médecins et les infirmiers de retourner dans leurs lieux d’affectation habituelle. Ainsi, il leur a été dit que « Dans les conditions actuelles, les forces de l’ordre, les miliciens comme la  population meurtrie, tous ont besoin de vous »

**L’implication et l’engagement du gouverneur de la Province s’avère pertinente et salvatrice dans cette situation**  

Un plaidoyer a été mené par l’UNICEF auprès du gouverneur de la province pour la sécurisation de l’aide des humanitaires, des prestataires de services sociaux de base et de l’équipe médicale qui ont accepté de regagner la zone de santé.

Suite à ce plaidoyer, non seulement le Gouverneur a organisé plusieurs rencontres de sensibilisation sur la paix avec les leaders traditionnels, communautaires et religieux avec un impact positif sur l’ampleur de la crise de sa province.

**De la communication extérieure à la communication pour le développement**  

Le principal résultat de la communication extérieure est le démarrage effectif de la réponse humanitaire multisectorielle sans aucun incident sécuritaire dans les deux Territoires. La mise en œuvre des interventions humanitaires a favorisé le retour progressif de la population dans leurs villages d’origine.

Pour consolider les actions humanitaires et promouvoir le relèvement précoce, il s’est avéré pertinent de passer de la communication extérieure (plaidoyer) à la communication pour le développement. C’est ainsi qu’il a été mis en place des Cellules d’Animation Communautaire (CAC) constituées par les Relais Communautaires ‘‘RCO’’ d’un village, chacun élu démocratiquement par les membres des 25 ménages voisins, et des personnes influentes du village, sous la supervision du Chef de village. La CAC, un cadre idéal de dialogue communautaire pour le développement, favorise dans les entités victimes de la crise, la résolution pacifique des conflits, l’identification des enfants vulnérables, la gestion communautaire des infrastructures (sources d’eau), la salubrité publique, la surveillance communautaire (Santé, Nutrition, Sécurité) et la réhabilitation des infrastructures, la reconstruction des maisons incendiées à tour de rôle par la population dans le village de Mupompa, l’Identification des Enfants non Accompagnés ‘‘ENA’’ et la réunification des familles…

« Ce jour-là, laissant le corps de mon époux tombé par balle devant la porte de la maison, j’ai fuis sans mes deux filles. Trois mois après, je suis retournée à Nkeena Kuna sans nouvelle aucune de mes enfants. Quelle consolation de les retrouver vivantes quatre mois après, ramenées par les partenaires de l’UNICEF devant la porte. J’ai compris ce jour-là que l’UNICEF s’occupe réellement des enfants et c’est pourquoi je lui dis infiniment merci. »  Madame Tshitolo de Nkeena Kuna a Kabeya Kamwanga.

**La communication, un levier pour une réponse humanitaire efficace**  

Cette expérience confirme le rôle prépondérant de la communication dans la mise en œuvre des réponses d’urgence dans les zones de crise humanitaire car elle joue le rôle de précurseur, de levier et de catalyseur pour une réponse humanitaire efficiente et efficace en facilitant l’appropriation, le relèvement précoce et la durabilité des actions. Cet approche a été adoptée et pratiquée par le Comité Provincial Inter-Agence ‘‘CPIA’’ de Mbuji-Mayi pour la réponse humanitaire dans les trois provinces issues du Kasaï-Oriental.

2364929,"L’UE agit pour rendre son aide humanitaire plus inclusive **La prise en compte des besoins des personnes handicapées devrait devenir obligatoire**

(Bruxelles, le 7 décembre 2017) – L’[Union européenne](https://www.hrw.org/fr/europe/central-asia/union-europeenne) est en train de prendre d’importantes mesures pour veiller à ce que l’aide humanitaire financée au niveau européen parvienne aux personnes handicapées, ont déclaré le Forum européen des personnes handicapées, Human Rights Watch et le Conseil norvégien pour les réfugiés. Lors des crises humanitaires, les personnes en situation de handicap font face à d’énormes problèmes, même pour accéder à des services aussi essentiels que la nourriture, l’eau, l’hygiène, l’hébergement, l’éducation ou la sécurité.

Lors du 4e Parlement européen des personnes handicapées, le 6 décembre 2017, Christos Stylianides, le Commissaire européen chargé de l’aide humanitaire et de la gestion des crises, a annoncé plusieurs mesures qui pourront considérablement améliorer l’accès des personnes handicapées à l’aide humanitaire dans le monde entier.

Les personnes en situation de handicap constituent un des groupes les plus vulnérables dans les situations d’urgence humanitaire. Pourtant ce sont aussi celles qu’on a le plus tendance à oublier, en partie à cause d’une méconnaissance des méthodes permettant d’inclure les personnes handicapées, en partie à cause d’un manque de normes clairement définies sur la façon de mettre en œuvre des actions humanitaires inclusives.

« Les acteurs de l’aide humanitaire consultent parfois les organisations de personnes handicapées, mais ne pensent pas forcément au fait que nous pouvons aussi fournir une aide directe dans les opérations humanitaires », a déclaré Yannis Vardakastanis, président du Forum européen des personnes handicapées (FEPH, ou ) en anglais). « Après tout, nous savons bien ce que c’est que de vivre avec un handicap, nous connaissons bien nos besoins. Cette situation doit changer. Nous sommes concernés, nous devons être consultés ! »

Quinze pour cent de la population mondiale – soit une personne sur sept – a un handicap. Cette proportion peut même augmenter dans les situations d’urgence en raison des blessures liées aux conflits ou aux désastres et de l’indisponibilité des services, notamment médicaux.

Au [Soudan du Sud](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2017/05/31/soudan-du-sud-les-personnes-handicapees-et-agees-sont-confrontees-des-dangers), en [Grèce](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2017/01/18/grece-les-refugies-handicapes-oublies-negliges) et en [République centrafricaine](https://reliefweb.int/node/2086779), les recherches de Human Rights Watch ont montré que dans les camps de réfugiés et de déplacés, les personnes handicapées souffraient de la négligence, de l’abandon et des obstacles les empêchant d’accéder aux services de base. Un homme ayant un handicap physique, qui vivait dans un camp pour personnes déplacées au sein de la République centrafricaine, a déclaré qu’il devait ramper pour aller aux latrines : « Je dois me déplacer sur les mains, et je n’ai pas de gants. Je dois les envelopper dans du tissu, si j’en trouve. La plupart du temps, je n’en trouve pas.  Franchement, je me fais pitié à moi-même. »

[Les recherches menées par le Forum européen des personnes handicapées auprès des personnes réfugiées en Grèce](http://www.edf-feph.org/migration-refugees-disabilities) ont également montré un manque d’accès aux services, y compris aux soins médicaux, et un accès insuffisant aux technologies d’assistance. Le membre grec du FEPH, la Confédération nationale des personnes handicapées, est maintenant directement impliqué pour soutenir les réfugiés handicapés et leurs familles, en coopération avec le HCR, l’agence des réfugiés des Nations Unies.

Stylianides [a annoncé](https://reliefweb.int/node/2361904) qu’à partir de 2018, les appels à propositions de l’office humanitaire de la Commission européenne (ECHO), qui finance les opérations des organisations humanitaires sur le terrain, souligneront que les candidatures devront inclure le cas des personnes handicapées dans les actions proposées. En outre, ECHO prévoit de mettre en place des normes visant à répondre aux besoins des personnes handicapées dans tous les projets financés par l’Union européenne.

Stylianides a également promis de consulter des personnes en situation de handicap et les organisations qui les représentent pour concevoir et mettre en œuvre ces initiatives, conformément à leur principe : « Nous sommes concernés, nous devons être consultés ! » (Nothing about us without us).

« C’est un véritable tournant pour les efforts accomplis dans le monde entier visant à ‘ne laisser personne de côté’ », a déclaré [Shantha Rau Barriga](https://www.hrw.org/fr/about/people/shantha-rau-barriga), directrice de la division Droits des handicapés à Human Rights Watch. « Si l’Europe accomplit ces changements, cela pourrait améliorer la vie de millions de personnes handicapées qui ont besoin d’aide dans les situations d’urgence se produisant dans le monde entier. »

L’Union européenne a clairement la responsabilité d’inclure les personnes handicapées dans les opérations qu’elle finance, ont déclaré les trois associations. La Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits des personnes handicapées, ratifiée par l’Union européenne, exige qu’elle assure la protection et la sécurité des personnes en situation de handicap dans le cadre des situations à risque et des urgences humanitaires, sans discrimination. De plus, l’Union européenne a soutenu la [Charte pour l’inclusion des personnes handicapées dans l’action humanitaire](http://humanitariandisabilitycharter.org/), prenant l’engagement d’éliminer la discrimination contre les personnes handicapées dans ses programmes et politiques humanitaires et de veiller à ce que ces personnes aient accès à l’assistance et à tous les services.

Afin de faire entendre la voix des réfugiés en situation de handicap par les décideurs européens, le Forum européen des personnes handicapées, Human Rights Watch et l’intergroupe Handicap du Parlement européen ont organisé en mars une [table ronde](Garantir que les aides parviennent aux réfugiés en situation de handicap) au Parlement européen. Lors de cet événement, [Nujeen Mustafa](https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/video/2017/06/01/nujeen-eu-refugees-disabilities-deserve-better), une jeune réfugiée handicapée de Syrie, s’était adressée à Stylianides : « C’est assez triste qu’au 21e siècle, les toilettes et des services de base soient considérées comme un luxe pour certaines personnes. Nous tous, nous méritons mieux que ça, et particulièrement les personnes handicapées. »

Même si les gouvernements, les donateurs et les organisations humanitaires sont submergés par d’autres priorités concurrentes, les besoins et préoccupations des personnes handicapées peuvent et doivent être pris en compte dès l’étape de planification des actions, ont déclaré le Forum européen des personnes handicapées, Human Rights Watch et le Conseil norvégien pour les réfugiés. Il s’agit notamment de faire en sorte que les travailleurs humanitaires, les forces de maintien de la paix et les autorités locales et nationales soient sensibilisés aux droits et aux besoins de protection des personnes handicapées. Il faut aussi renforcer les capacités et compétences permettant aux travailleurs humanitaires d’identifier et d’inclure les personnes handicapées dans les systèmes mis en place, que ce soit pour se préparer aux situations d’urgence ou pour y répondre.

« L’Union européenne, un des plus importants donateurs au monde, possède un énorme potentiel pour pousser ses partenaires, qui mettent en œuvre les actions, à inclure les personnes handicapées dans leurs activités. Elle peut ainsi devenir un leader en matière d’inclusion des personnes handicapées dans le secteur humanitaire », a déclaré Édouard Rodier, directeur chargé de l’Europe au Conseil norvégien pour les réfugiés. « Nous en appelons à toutes les entités donatrices pour suivre l’exemple d’ECHO et faire en sorte que les besoins des personnes en situation de handicap ne soient plus négligés dans les situations de crise. »",268,"French"
2364909,"IFRC and partners advocate to stop tuberculosis epidemic The World Health Organization estimated 10.4 million new cases of [Tuberculosis (TB)](http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/tb-hiv/en/) globally, and 1.4 million deaths resulting from the disease. There has been enormous progress made in the global fight against TB, saving an estimated 53 million lives since 2000 and reducing the TB mortality rate by 37%, according to the [Global TB Report 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2299404). This is a result of joint efforts and close partnerships with national and international partners, communities and civil society.

To spark and continue the conversation on TB, the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) hosted a three-day meeting on November 27-29 in Panama among 15 Red Cross National Societies and civil society representatives from 18 Latin American countries, Stop TB Partnership, REDTBLAC, and the Americas TB Coalition.

TB is one of the leading causes of death among infectious diseases globally, killing nearly 5,000 people every day. This disease is preventable and curable, but is also deeply rooted in communities “left behind”, disproportionately affecting those who live in poverty and have limited access to health services. Combined with antimicrobial resistance it can evolve into multidrug-resistant TB, which poses a major health security risk. In addition, people with HIV, are at particularly high risk of contracting and dying from TB.

“One of the Sustainable Development Goals laid out by the United Nations is to stop the TB epidemic and the co-infection of TB and HIV. For this we need to shift the paradigm of this disease. We need to change the way we look at TB and centre our actions around the people who are affected by the disease. We need to sensitize Governments, and promote more effective responses based on human rights and focused on gender sensitive approaches” – said Maria Franca Tallarico, Health Director for IFRC Americas.

The main objectives of the meeting were to build the capacity of TB community advocates and Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) volunteers to engage collectively and strategically in TB and HIV advocacy; identify advocacy priorities for the LAC region and strengthen the regional network of Tuberculosis advocates.

This was the first of five meetings to be held at the global level. Together, the Stop TB Partnership, regional TB communities and Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies will conduct regional capacity building workshops. The results, joint vision and agreements made at each meeting will feed into the advocacy strategy in preparation of the High-Level Meeting of the United Nations on Tuberculosis, which will take place in September 2018.",268,"French"

Les travaux du financés à hauteur de près de vingt-quatre mille dollars américain est un projet à impact rapide du bureau GENRE de la MONUSCO. Les travaux qui ont commencé en janvier, exécutés par l’entreprise TEMBO CONSTRUCTION, ont consisté à la réhabilitation et l’équipement de quatre salles, dont une grande pouvant accueillir plus de cent personnes. Ce centre de formation professionnelle aidera les femmes et jeunes filles mères désœuvrées de la ville de Kisangani à se prendre en charge.

Pour Mme Aissetou SANOGO, cheffe  de bureau MONUSCO Kisangani, cette intervention de la MONUSCO vient en renforcement de la campagne de 16 jours d’activisme contre les violences sexuelles faites aux   femmes et aux jeunes filles.  Elle pense que les activités organisées dans ce centre notamment la formation des filles mères, femmes analphabètes et filles désœuvrées contribueront à l’élimination des violences basées sur le genre.

L’archevêque métropolitain de Kisangani et président de la CENCO, Monseigneur Marcel UTEMBI TAPA a apprécié ce partenariat avec la MONUSCO et croit à son succès par les sœurs de la sainte famille. Ces dernières très engagées dans la charité notamment la promotion chrétienne des familles dans le domaine de l’éducation et l’encadrement des filles mères et désœuvrées. 

Les bénéficiaires se sont réjouies du beau cadre qui va désormais les permettre d’étudier et de travailler dans des conditions requises. Elles promettent d’en faire bon usage pour que les générations futures en soient aussi bénéficiaires.

Quant aux  sœurs de la Sainte famille, elles promettent leur disponibilité, engagement, et dévouement à cette œuvre qui valorise les filles mères désœuvrées en les intégrant dans la société. Elles en appellent à la collaboration sincère avec le ministère ayant la femme dans ses attributions en vue d’un éventuel soutien et la défense des activités du centre.

Pour la petite histoire, c’est suite à une demande de la congrégation des sœurs catholiques de la santé familiale à la MONUSCO, que cette dernière a répondu favorablement et le protocole d’accord a été signé en janvier 2017.

2364849,"Sud-Kivu : des maisons endommagées suite au tremblement des terres à Walungu Bukavu, le 07 décembre 2017 (caritasdev.cd) : une série de tremblement de terre a secoué la province du Sud-Kivu au courant de la semaine du 20 au 25 Novembre 2017. L’épicentre serait situé dans le territoire de Walungu. Cependant jusqu’à la rédaction de cette alerte, il n’y a pas encore eu de précision sur la magnitude.

En date du 30 Novembre 2017, aux environs de minuit et quarante-trois minutes, les premiers tremblements ont été ressentis dans la province. Le samedi 02 décembre, il y a eu réplique aux environs de 19h°° . Le lendemain matin, soit le dimanche 03 décembre 2017,  il a été constaté des répliques,  mais mineures.

Cependant, dans la nuit du lundi 4 au Mardi 5 décembre 2017, aux environs de 2h30’ il s’est ressenti un tremblement avec une forte intensité. C’est ce dernier qui aurait beaucoup plus accentué les dégâts et aurait mis la population dans une crainte énorme.

Par ailleurs, les groupements les plus touchés sont : Burhale, Irongo et Walungu. Dans ces zones, il faut signaler que la plupart d’habitations dans le territoire de Walungu sont construites en planche et en terre et/ou en chaume.

La plupart des maisons ayant connu des fissures et/ou détruites, sont globalement celles des religieux (presbytères, couvents des sœurs, etc), mais aussi quelques écoles et trop peu d’habitation au sein de la communauté.
Les élèves sont entassés dans des salles des classes n’ayant pas été trop touchées. Il se pose dès lors un problème de promiscuité, mais aussi d’exposition aux  intempéries. Ce qui ne favorise pas un meilleur apprentissage.

2364829,"Burkina Faso : des experts de l'ONU exhortent Ouagadougou à libérer Djibril Bassolé 7 décembre 2017 – Les experts du Groupe de travail sur la détention arbitraire de l'ONU ont appelé jeudi les autorités du Burkina Faso à libérer immédiatement l'ancien ministre Djibril Yipéné Bassolé, qui a été arrêté après un coup d'Etat manqué en septembre 2015.

M. Bassolé, qui est âgé de 60 ans, est accusé d'avoir soutenu une tentative de renversement du gouvernement et a été inculpé d'attaque contre la sécurité de l'Etat et de collusion avec une puissance étrangère. M. Bassolé a toujours nié ces accusations.

En avril 2017, le Groupe de travail a examiné sa détention et a déterminé qu'elle était arbitraire. Le groupe de travail avait déjà appelé à l'époque à ce qu'il soit libéré.

M. Bassolé, qui a été Ministre de la sécurité (2000-2007) et par deux fois Ministre des affaires étrangères du Burkina-Faso (2008-2011 et 2011-2014), est sorti de prison et a été placé en résidence surveillée il y a deux mois. Les avocats de M. Bassolé ont alors demandé au Groupe de travail de rendre un nouvel avis sur cette détention, mais cette demande a été rejetée.

« Bien que les conditions de sa détention aient pu changer, la privation de liberté n'a pas cessé », a toutefois déclaré le Groupe de travail. « Nous appelons le gouvernement du Burkina Faso à respecter les normes internationales et à libérer M. Bassolé maintenant ».

Les autorités burkinabè ont demandé que cet avis soit réexaminé, mais le Groupe de travail a conclu que la demande n'atteignait pas le seuil requis pour un tel examen et insiste pour que M. Bassolé soit libéré immédiatement.",268,"French"
2364819,"RDC : des millions de personnes dans le Kasaï menacées par la faim, selon l'ONU 7 décembre 2017 – Une crise alimentaire dans la région du Grand Kasaï, en République démocratique du Congo (RDC), pourrait se transformer en catastrophe à long terme en raison du manque d'argent pour l'assistance humanitaire, a averti jeudi le Programme alimentaire mondial des Nations Unies ([PAM](http://fr.wfp.org/)).

« Nous laissons tomber ceux qui ont le plus besoin de nous », a déclaré Claude Jibidar, Représentant du PAM en RDC. « Sans le soutien immédiat des donateurs, beaucoup - en particulier les femmes et les enfants – mourront », a-t-il prévenu.

L'éruption de violence dans ce qui était autrefois une région pauvre mais paisible de la RDC a fait d'innombrables victimes. Environ 1,4 million de personnes ont été chassées de chez elles. Les taux de malnutrition traditionnellement élevés ont explosé, a précisé l'agence humanitaire onusienne.

Avec 3,2 millions de personnes désespérément à court de nourriture, le PAM est intervenu avec une aide d'urgence.

Une accalmie dans les combats a permis de déployer plus de personnel. Les travailleurs humanitaires se sont déployés dans les zones rurales du Kasaï.

Le PAM a coordonné des vols logistiques et humanitaires, ce qui a permis d'augmenter rapidement le nombre de personnes recevant une assistance, de 42.000 en septembre à 115.000 en octobre et 225.000 en novembre. Le mois dernier, 13.500 enfants ont reçu des aliments enrichis spéciaux.

Mais la réticence des donateurs à s'engager au Kasaï compromet cet effort. Alors que le PAM prévoit de nourrir près d'un demi-million de personnes en décembre, les caisses de l'agence onusienne sont tellement épuisées que seules des demi-rations peuvent être distribuées.

La faim ne met pas seulement des vies en danger, elle force les gens à la prostitution et augmente le risque de violence sexuelle, a souligné M. Jibidar. « Les partenaires du gouvernement doivent faire tout ce qui est en leur pouvoir pour épargner au Kasaï le genre de catastrophe humanitaire qui dure depuis des décennies et qui sévit dans d'autres régions de la RDC », a-t-il ajouté.",268,"French"
2364809,"Trente-sept pays ont besoin d'une aide alimentaire extérieure, selon la FAO 7 décembre 2017 – Trente-sept pays, dont 29 se trouvant en Afrique, ont besoin d'une aide alimentaire externe, a mis en garde jeudi l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO) dans son dernier rapport sur les '[Perspectives de récolte et la situation alimentaire](http://www.fao.org/giews/reports/crop-prospects/fr/)'.

L'abondance des récoltes céréalières contribue à maintenir les réserves alimentaires mondiales mais la sécheresse, les inondations et les conflits prolongés ont intensifié et fait perdurer l'insécurité alimentaire.

Les 37 pays ayant actuellement besoin d'une aide alimentaire externe sont : l'Afghanistan, le Burkina Faso, le Burundi, le Cameroun, la République centrafricaine, le Tchad, le Congo, La République populaire démocratique de Corée, la République démocratique du Congo, Djibouti, l'Erythrée, l'Ethiopie, la Guinée, Haïti, l'Iraq, le Kenya, le Lesotho, le Libéria, la Libye, Madagascar, le Malawi, le Mali, la Mauritanie, le Mozambique, la Birmanie, le Niger, le Nigéria, le Pakistan, la Sierra Leone, la Somalie, le Soudan du Sud, le Soudan, le Swaziland, la Syrie, l'Ouganda, le Yémen et le Zimbabwe.

**Les conflits entravent les plantations et les récoltes**

Les conflits en cours continuent d'être un facteur clé des situations de grave insécurité alimentaire en ayant notamment provoqué des conditions proches de la famine dans le Nord du Nigéria, au Soudan du Sud et au Yémen. Ils ont également entraîné une généralisation des souffrances liées à la faim en Afghanistan, en République centrafricaine (RCA), en République démocratique du Congo (RDC) et en Syrie.

D'après la FAO, les conflits exacerbent l'insécurité alimentaire en empêchant les activités productives, en entravant l'accès des populations à la nourriture, mais aussi en réduisant sa disponibilité. Ces contraintes sont par ailleurs intensifiées par le nombre important de déplacés internes. En RCA, leur nombre a augmenté de près de 50% cette année avec près d'un tiers de la population (soit 1,1 million de personnes) qui a besoin d'une aide alimentaire de manière urgente.

Selon les estimations, près de 7,7 millions de personnes devraient se retrouver confrontées à une situation d'insécurité alimentaire aiguë en RDC, un pays qui accueille plus de 200.000 réfugiés venus des pays voisins, ainsi que plus de 4 millions de déplacés internes. Les agriculteurs vivant dans les régions du Kasaï et de Tanganyika, lourdement affectées par le conflit, ont signalé une baisse des plantations.

Le rapport souligne des répercussions similaires dues au conflit dans le Nord du Nigéria- où 3 millions de personnes ont besoin d'une intervention d'urgence qui devra également être en mesure de protéger leurs moyens d'existence - et au Soudan du Sud, où malgré des récoltes récentes, près de 45% de la population (ou 4,8 millions de personnes) sont en situation d'insécurité alimentaire et le nombre de celles se retrouvant en situation d'urgence ont doublé par rapport à l'année dernière.

En Somalie, le risque de faire face à une situation de famine dans plusieurs régions a été évité jusqu'à ce jour principalement grâce à une intervention humanitaire de grande envergure. Les cas de souffrances liées à la faim ont triplé l'année dernière et près de 3,1 millions de personnes sont considérées comme étant en situation de grave insécurité alimentaire.

Au Yémen, 60% de la population (soit 17 millions de personnes) aurait besoin d'une aide humanitaire d'urgence. Selon le rapport, si la fermeture des ports maritimes du pays, comme cela est arrivé le mois dernier, venait à se répéter, cela augmenterait le risque d'émergence de famine.

Les cas de faim chronique persistent également dans les pays touchés par la guerre tels que l'Afghanistan - où le nombre de personnes fuyant leurs domiciles a augmenté cette année et 7,6 millions de personnes font maintenant face à une situation d'insécurité alimentaire modérée ou grave - l'Iraq, où 3,2 millions de personnes ont besoin d'une aide alimentaire, et la Syrie, où 6,5 millions de personnes souffrent de la faim.

**Une insécurité alimentaire causée par la sécheresse et les inondations**

Dans certaines régions, les conditions climatiques défavorables ont également des conséquences néfastes sur la production alimentaire des fermes, avec notamment la sécheresse qui a sévi en Afrique de l'Est et les inondations qui ont touché certaines régions de l'Asie.

La sécheresse est le principal problème de l'Afrique de l'Est. Selon les estimations, près de 8,5 millions de personnes sont en situation d'insécurité alimentaire en Ethiopie, en particulier dans la région Somali. Des saisons pluvieuses défavorables ont contribué à réduire la production alimentaire et animale au Kenya, où près de 2,6 millions de personnes sont confrontées à une situation de grave insécurité alimentaire.

Une grave sécheresse estivale en Mongolie a également réduit de près de moitié les récoltes de blé dans ce pays d'Asie du Nord-Est.

Au Bangladesh, trois inondations soudaines survenues cette année ont gravement endommagé les cultures de riz. La production nationale de riz paddy dans ce pays d'Asie du Sud devrait connaître un important déclin et atteindre son niveau le plus bas en l'espace de cinq ans.",268,"French"
2364804,"Perspectives de récolte et situation alimentaire No. 3, Septembre 2017 **Pays nécessitant une aide alimentaire extérieure**

Selon les estimations de la FAO, 37 pays ont besoin d’une aide alimentaire extérieure à l’échelle de la planète. La persistance des conflits a continué de nuire gravement à la production agricole ainsi qu’à la sécurité alimentaire. Les chocs météorologiques, notamment des inondations, des ouragans et des sécheresses, ont aggravé la situation déjà précaire de la sécurité alimentaire dans certains des pays touchés par des conflits, et ont également provoqué des déficits de production qui ont compromis la disponibilité alimentaire et l’accès aux denrées dans d’autres.

**Faits saillants par région**

AFRIQUE Les régions du nord du Nigéria, la Somalie et le Soudan du Sud restent en proie à une grave insécurité alimentaire, tandis que la sécheresse qui sévit dans certaines régions d’Afrique de l’Est a freiné la production agricole et fait grimper les prix des denrées alimentaires.  
Des conditions plus humides en Afrique australe ont favorisé un redressement de la production qui a considérablement fait baisser le nombre de personnes en situation d’insécurité alimentaire, alors que les graves inondations qui ont frappé certaines régions d’Afrique de l’Ouest ont touché un grand nombre de personnes.

ASIE Malgré de graves inondations et des sécheresses localisées dans certains pays, la production en Extrême-Orient devrait augmenter en 2017. En Iraq, en République arabe syrienne et au Yémen, l’agriculture et la sécurité alimentaire ont continué de subir les effets néfastes des conflits. Ailleurs au Proche-Orient, des conditions météorologiques généralement bonnes ont favorisé un accroissement de la production.

AMÉRIQUE LATINE ET CARAÏBES Dans les Caraïbes, les répercussions des ouragans devraient compromettre la production agricole des campagnes secondaires dans les zones touchées et avoir une incidence négative sur la sécurité alimentaire. En Amérique du Sud, les récoltes céréalières de 2017 devraient atteindre des niveaux record en Argentine et au Brésil.",268,"French"

• Le faible niveau de financements humanitaires aura été un défi majeur en 2017 

• Maniema, Sud-Kivu et Tanganyika face à la crise à leurs limites communes 

• Les contraintes budgétaires fragilisent sensiblement l’action humanitaire dans le Nord-Kivu. 

**RDC : Anatomie d’une crise humanitaire aiguë**

Lorsque la situation humanitaire du Kasaï se détériore début 2017, la communauté humanitaire avait déjà publié son plan de réponse humanitaire 2017. Les acteurs humanitaires décident alors d’élaborer un plan de réponse d’urgence spécifique à la crise kasaïenne – Kasaï, Kasaï Central, Kasaï Oriental, Lomami et Sankuru- dont les besoins estimés représentaient 400% de ce qui était planifié pour la région dans le plan de réponse humanitaire 2017. Le 25 avril 2017, la communauté humanitaire lança officiellement un appel de 64,5 millions de dollars pour répondre aux besoins les plus urgents de cette crise : 731 000 personnes seront ciblées par cet appel d’urgence. Depuis le début de la réponse à l’urgence, plus de 425 000 personnes ont reçu une assistance humanitaire, soit 58 pour cent des 731 000 personnes ciblées dans l’Appel.

La crise dans le Kasaï, le Tanganyika et le Sud Kivu, pour ne citer que ces trois, est actuellement la partie visible d’une longue crise qui, de façon quotidienne, émaille la vie de paisibles citoyens.

En République démocratique du Congo, plus grand pays d’Afrique au sud du désert du Sahara, partageant ses frontières avec huit pays, plus de 6 000 personnes sont obligées de fuir leurs foyers par jour pour rester en vie. « Chanceux » sont ceux qui souffrent d’un déplacement à court terme, comme ceux qui sont obligés de fuir le matin, et retourner chez eux dans l’après-midi, si la maison n’a pas été pillée encore moins détruite ou incendiée. Le chiffre est encore plus impressionnant si l'on considère que tous ces mouvements de personnes se sont déroulés - au moins jusqu'à l’éclatement de la crise kasaïenne en août 2016 - dans une seule partie de ce massif pays, l’Est du pays.

Aujourd'hui, la RD Congo abrite au moins 4,1 millions des personnes déplacées, le plus grand nombre en Afrique. Ce chiffre dépasse le nombre d’habitants de certaines capitales européennes. Sur ce chiffre, quelque 428 000 ont été déplacés entre juillet et septembre 2017. 1 million de personnes le sont dans la Province du Nord-Kivu. Un an auparavant, le pays comptait 1,9 millions de personnes déplacées.

Conflit et violence armée sont les principaux facteurs poussant les familles hors de leurs maisons. Si les provinces orientales continuent de subir les effets de ces violences, de commander un œil regardant, la crise du Kasaï a généré beaucoup d’attention, forçant les agences des Nations Unies et les ONG nationales et internationales à intervenir dans ce qui était autrefois une région pauvre mais paisible. La crise du Kasaï, avec quelque 770 000 personnes déplacées à ce jours et les combats interethniques au Tanganyika ont grandement contribué au chiffre de plus de 1,5 millions des personnes déplacées dans cette seule année 2017.

Les chiffres sont importants mais il est important d’aller au-delà. Alors que la nouvelle du retour des familles est considérée comme un développement positif, l’inquiétude des organisations humanitaires concerne les conditions de retour de ces familles, victimes d’une tactique de « terre brulée » ? Que leur réserve leur retour ? Pour beaucoup, pas grand-chose ! Maisons et tous les souvenirs personnels, vêtements, livres et jouets des enfants, stocks de nourriture sont maintenant des cendres. Des centaines de milliers de personnes ne comptent que sur l’aide humanitaire pour refaire leur vie. Derrière tous ces chiffres, il y a des visages humains, en majorité des enfants, dont l’avenir est en grand danger.

Les organisations d’aide en RDC fonctionnent dans un environnement exceptionnellement complexe et difficile. L’insécurité a entravé la capacité des partenaires humanitaires d’atteindre 800 000 personnes entre juin et septembre 2017, et le manque d’infrastructures logistiques pour traverser notamment de vastes étendues de désert ajoutent une couche supplémentaire de complexité. 12% des cas aigus de malnutrition de la planète

De l’Est à l’Ouest, du Nord au sud, le pays est traversé de vastes terres vertes ; le célèbre fleuve Congo et ses nombreux affluents fournissant l’eau nécessaire aux agriculteurs. Cependant environ 7,7 millions personnes à travers le pays souffrent de malnutrition - une augmentation de 30 pour cent par rapport à 2016. De ce nombre, près de 2 millions de personnes sont touchées par la malnutrition sévère, ce qui représente 12 % du nombre de cas aigus dans le monde. Le Programme alimentaire mondial (PAM) estime que la malnutrition coûte environ 1 milliard de dollars US par an au pays, équivalent à plus de 4,5 pour cent du produit intérieur brut.

En RDC, la malnutrition est liée à l’insécurité qui pousse les agriculteurs et tous les bras-valides loin des riches terres agricoles. Au Kasaï, des milliers de familles ont raté deux saisons culturales. Le patron du PAM, David Beasley, a récemment conclu une visite dans le pays, appelant à davantage de fonds pour nourrir les familles, notamment les enfants.

**Niveau de financement le plus bas**

Plus de 400 projets humanitaires sont mis en œuvre dans l’Est du pays et dans la région du Kasaï ; les acteurs humanitaires ont pu assister plus de 2,7 millions de personnes cette année, loin des 7,4 millions de personnes ciblées par le plan d’intervention humanitaire. Ce faible niveau d’aide est lié au niveau de financement.  
Sauf miracle de dernière heure, cette année pourrait faire son entrée dans les annales de l’histoire humanitaire comme la pire année en termes de financement humanitaire sur les 10 dernières années. Au 7 décembre, la communauté humanitaire n’avait recueilli que 49,1%2 des $812.5 millions demandés.

Face à cette situation peu radieuse, une note positive provient du Fonds Humanitaire, ce mécanisme de financement à travers duquel les partenaires financiers font des contributions afin d’apporter une réponse urgente aux besoins humanitaires. Créé en 2007, le Fonds a franchi la barre de 1 milliard de dollars US de contributions. Au-delà des contributions, le plus important reste les nombreuses réalisations et projets qui ont été menés via le Fonds. De la Province de l’Equateur au Haut-Katanga en passant par l’Ituri, le Fonds finance depuis une décennie de nombreux projets qui ont permis de sauver des vies et donner les moyens à des communautés de se reconstruire. Le Fonds ayant une enveloppe limitée- liée aux contributions-, il ne peut répondre à tous les besoins dans le pays. Des intenses efforts de plaidoyer sont en cours pour que d’ici la fin de l’année, de nouveaux financements puissent être alloués à la communauté humanitaire.",268,"French"

**Valable pour : octobre - août 2017**  
**Créé le : 18 novembre 2017**

**Résumé narratif des causes, du contexte et des principaux problèmes**

- **La production céréalière prévisionnelle** de la campagne agricole 2017-2018 est estimée à 2 862 610 tonnes, soit une hausse de 3,2% par rapport à la moyenne des cinq dernières années. Toutes les spéculations (mil, sorgho et maïs) ont enregistré des légères hausses de productions, excepté le riz qui a enregistré une légère baisse. Toutefois, certaines régions ont enregistré une baisse de la production céréalière, notamment le Wadi Fira (-27,2%) ; Barh El Ghazal (-20,5%) ; Kanem (-27,7%) ; Batha (-4,9%) ; Lac (-7,6%) et Moy Chari (-5%).

- **La situation pastorale est globalement acceptable**. Les bonnes précipitations enregistrées pendant la saison des pluies ont favorisé un bon développement de la végétation et le remplissage des mares, sur une bonne partie du pays. Cependant, des déficits fourragers importants ont été enregistrés dans les régions de Wadi Fira, Nord Ouaddaï, Batha, Kanem et du Bahr El Ghazal à cause du retard dans l’installation de la saison des pluies et des séquences sèches assez longues. Cette situation a entrainé une descente précoce des transhumants dès le mois de septembre vers les zones les plus pourvues en pâturage, ce qui pourrait engendrer des conflits entre agriculteurs et éleveurs.

- **Les marchés sont bien approvisionnés en produits agricoles** (céréales, tubercules, légumineuses, etc.) issus des récoltes en cours et des stocks de commerçants. Ils sont également approvisionnés par d’importantes quantités des produits vivriers (riz, farine, sucre, pates, huile,…) en provenance de la Libye, du Soudan et du Cameroun. La demande céréalière reprend timidement à cause de la crise économique que traverse le pays, cependant, dans les zones déficitaires, elle reste importante du fait de la reconstitution des stocks. Les prix des céréales sont en baisse en zone sahélienne, mais stables à hausse légère dans la plupart des marchés de la zone soudanienne.  

**L’analyse de la Consommation Alimentaire** montre que 8,3% des ménages ont une consommation alimentaire pauvre et 15,7% une consommation limite. Pour ces deux catégories de ménages, l’alimentation est très peu variée (respectivement 4 et 5 groupes d’aliments) et moins riche. Les ménages qui ont une consommation alimentaire acceptable consomment environ sept (7) groupes d’aliments sur les douze. L’analyse des résultats HEA sur trente un (31) Départements montre qu’un département présente de déficit de survie et neuf (9) autres des déficits de protection des moyens d’existence. Ces déficits sont dus principalement aux baisses importantes de prix de bétail, de revenu tiré de l’exode, de la main d’œuvre locale, de transfert monétaire, mais aussi à une baisse de production agricole dans certains départements.  

**L’analyse de l’évolution des moyens d’existence** montre que 2% des ménages ont développé des stratégies d’urgence et 21% des stratégies de crise. Les contraintes d’accès à une nourriture suffisante, riche et variée ont conduit ces ménages à recourir à des stratégies particulièrement sévères pouvant conduire à une altération des leurs moyens d’existence. En plus 20% des ménages ont développé des stratégies de stress.  

**Nutrition :** La situation est toujours préoccupante dans la plupart des régions de la bande sahélienne. Les résultats de la dernière enquête SMART de juillet-août 2017 révèlent, au plan national, que la prévalence de la Malnutrition Aiguë Globale (MAG) est au-dessus du seuil d’alerte de 10% fixé par l’OMS. Au niveau régional, la prévalence de la MAG dépasse le seuil d’urgence de 15% fixé par l’OMS) dans douze (12) régions parmi les vingt-trois (23). Il s’agit d’Ennedi Est (30,0%), d’Ennedi Ouest (27,3%), du Salamat (23,0%), du Batha (22,1%), du Bahr El Ghazal (21,3%), du Wadi Fira (20,5%), du Kanem (19,2%), du Lac (18,1%), du Borkou (17,7%), du Sila (17,1%), de Hadjer Lamis (16,3%) et Ndjamena (16,3%).

**Mortalité :** Le taux brut de mortalité observé au niveau national est inférieur au seuil d’alerte de 1 décès pour 10 000 personnes par jour (0,49 décès pour 10 000 personnes par jour). Seule, la région du Guera présente un taux de 1,03 décès pour 10 000 personnes par jour, taux supérieur à ce seuil.  
Chez les moins de 5 ans, le taux de mortalité est de 0,83 décès pour 10 000 enfants par jour ; ce qui est en dessous du seuil d’urgence. Aucune région n’est au-dessus du seuil d’alerte de 2 décès pour 10 000 enfants de moins de 5 ans par jour.",268,"French"
2364209,"PAM Tchad Appel pour la Nutrition, Novembre 2017 **Taux alarmants de malnutrition**

La dénutrition demeure l'un des plus grands défis au Tchad. L'enquête SMART menée par l'UNICEF en juillet-août 2017 montre une détérioration de la situation nutritionnelle par rapport à 2016. La prévalence nationale de la malnutrition aiguë globale (MAG) est de 13,9% chez les enfants âgés de 6 à 59 mois, proche du seuil d'alerte de 15% de l'OMS. La malnutrition aiguë sévère atteint 4,2% chez les enfants, avec des niveaux alarmants dans toutes les régions sahéliennes. La prévalence de la malnutrition chronique est estimée à 32,4%, dépassant le seuil OMS de 30%. 

Une action multisectorielle urgente est nécessaire pour éviter une augmentation de la mortalité avant le début de la prochaine période de soudure (mai/ juin 2018) habituellement marquée par une augmentation des taux de malnutrition. En 2018, les partenaires du Cluster Nutrition prévoient d'aider plus de 500 000 enfants et femmes mal nourris: 169 000 enfants souffrant de malnutrition aiguë modérée et 200 300 enfants de moins de cinq ans sévèrement mal nourris. 

Suite aux résultats SMART, le Cluster Nutrition développe une stratégie de réponse commune en accord avec le plan de réponse du gouvernement. L'objectif sera de conjuguer les efforts dans les zones géographiques prioritaires grâce à des interventions multisectorielles menées conjointement par le PAM et l'UNICEF dans les domaines interdépendants de la nutrition, de la sécurité alimentaire, de la protection sociale, de l'eau et de l'assainissement.  

Le PAM fait face à un grave déficit de financement pour cette intervention et a besoin d'au moins 5 millions de dollars pour acheter des aliments nutritifs spécialisés pour répondre aux cas les plus urgents de malnutrition chez les jeunes enfants et les femmes enceintes et allaitantes pour les 6 prochains mois.",268,"French"
2364194,"R.D. Congo – Nord-Kivu : Note d’informations humanitaires du 4 décembre 2017 **Faits saillants**

- Les activités des groupes armés perturbent des opérations humanitaires dans le Lubero et le Masisi

- Plus de 13 000 déplacés bénéficient d’aide humanitaire dans le Territoire de Beni 

**Aperçu de la situation**

La province du Nord-Kivu reste caractérisée par un contexte instable dû aux activités des groupes armes. Ceux-ci non seulement causent plusieurs mouvements de population mais aussi limitent l’accès et l’action humanitaire dans certaines zones.  

Une série d’attaques de la part d’un groupe armé contre les FARDC dans le Territoire de Lubero a perturbé les foires aux vivres et AME que l’ONG Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) avait entamé pour plus de 9 500 déplacés et familles d’accueil d’Alibongo et de Vutsorovia. Les équipes d’intervention de NRC se sont repliés sur Lubero dans l’attente que les conditions sécuritaires s’améliorent pour la poursuite des foires.  

Dans le Territoire de Masisi, les activités des groupes armés rendent difficile l’accès humanitaire, particulièrement dans la zone de Mpati. Plusieurs interventions en vivres, en articles ménagers et d’autres sont difficilement implémentées dans cette zone, puisque des groupes armés entravent les opérations humanitaires.  

Le même territoire est marqué par trois principaux afflux des mouvements des population. Dans la zone de Bwiza, les habitants des villages proches du parc national de Virunga fuient une tension en gestation entre les communautés depuis les tueries intervenues le mois passé. Plus de 2 000 ménages ont été enregistré à Kitchanga. Un autre afflux est celui d’à peu près 700 ménages déplacés originaires de Lukala et Birii en Territoire de Masisi, qui ont été reçu par les familles autochtones de Pinga (Walikale) suite aux affrontements entre groupes armés à Birii et ses environs. Le dernier déplacement concerne plus de 1 200 personnes en provenance de Bihira qui se sont installés dans des conditions très déplorables à Butare et à Tambi, s’exposant à plusieurs risques, notamment celui des maladies d’origine hydrique. Selon Save the Children International et les autorités sanitaires de Mweso, 150 cas de diarrhée dont 14 décès ont été notifiés dans l’aire de santé de Butare. Plus de 120 cas d’Infection respiratoire aigüe ont aussi été rapportés dans cette même zone.",268,"French"
2363369,"Les enfants invisibles : moins d’une naissance sur deux est enregistrée en Afrique subsaharienne **Au rythme actuel, 115 million d’enfants n’auront pas d’existence officielle en 2030**

Nouakchott/Dakar, 7 décembre 2017 – Quatre-vingt-quinze millions d’enfants en Afrique Subsaharienne n’ont pas été enregistrés à la naissance, et ce nombre pourrait grimper à 115 millions en 2030 si des mesures énergiques ne sont pas prises, affirme l’UNICEF aujourd’hui.

L’UNICEF publie ces chiffres à l’occasion de la Quatrième Conférence des ministres africains chargés de l’enregistrement des faits d’état civil qui se tient à Nouakchott en Mauritanie cette semaine, et demande aux pays africains de donner la priorité à l'enregistrement des naissances en tant que première étape critique d'un système national fonctionnel d'enregistrement civil et de statistiques vitales

« La non existence légale des enfants ne peut pas continuer à des niveaux si élevés, a déclaré Leila Pakkala, Directrice Régionale de l’UNICEF pour l’Afrique de l’Est et Afrique Australe. “Sans document prouvant son identité, son âge ou sa nationalité, un enfant est exposé aux violations de ses droits, tels que le mariage précoce, le travail forcé ou le recrutement dans les forces armées. »

Selon l’UNICEF, l’analyse des tendances montre que le taux d’enregistrement des naissances ne s’est pas amélioré aux cours des seize dernières années. Avec une population infantile en pleine croissance, et des progrès trop lents en matière d’état civil, il pourrait en 2030 y avoir près de 115 millions d’enfants sans existence légale en Afrique subsaharienne, ce qui est bien loin de l’objectif de développement durable 16.9 qui vise à garantir à tous une identité juridique, notamment grâce à l’enregistrement des naissances.

Cependant, malgré les nombreux défis, il est démontré à travers le continent que la coordination avec d'autres secteurs sociaux, en particulier les services de soins de santé pour les enfants, ainsi que les campagnes de vaccination, peut accélérer et augmenter l’enregistrement des enfants nés dans les établissements de santé et à la maison.

« Dans plusieurs pays sur le continent, l’expérience a montré que le couplage des services de santé et d'état-civil peut remédier aux faibles taux d'inscription des naissances, a déclaré Marie-Pierre Poirier, directrice régionale de l'UNICEF pour l'Afrique de l’Ouest et du Centre. Des pays comme le Ghana, le Mali, le Sénégal, l'Ouganda, la Namibie et l'Éthiopie ont presque doublé leurs taux d’enregistrement en liant les deux secteurs. »

L’UNICEF soutient Le Programme pour l’Amélioration Accélérée de l’Enregistrement des Faits d’Etat Civil et de l’Etablissement des Statistiques de l’Etat Civil en Afrique (APAI-CRVS), qui vise à réformer définitivement les systèmes d'état civil, y compris l'enregistrement des naissances sur l'ensemble du continent.

2363359,"Le Gouvernement et la MINUSCA ont tenu leur conférence de presse conjointe Le Gouvernement centrafricain et la MINUSCA ont réaffirmé mercredi l’importance de communiquer sur le partenariat entre les deux institutions, à l’occasion de leur conférence de presse conjointe tenue à Bangui, au siège de Radio Centrafrique.

« C’est un exercice important et d’un grand intérêt qui permet d’évoquer la coopération entre le Gouvernement et la MINUSCA. Cela vous donne (journalistes) l’opportunité de nous questionner sur les réalités du moment, et sur la réalité de la coopération entre la MINUSCA et le gouvernement » a indiqué le Ministre de la Communication et des Médias, porte-parole du Gouvernement, Maxime-Ange Kazagui. Pour sa part, le porte-parole de la MINUSCA, Vladimir Monteiro, a rappelé que l’exercice est le prolongement du partenariat qui lie la MINUSCA et le Gouvernement qui, “tous les jours, à différents niveaux de représentation, se réunissent, discutent, échangent et coordonnent leurs actions.”

Les deux porte-parole ont d’abord évoqué les récentes actions menées par leurs institutions respectives avant d’être interrogés, entre autres, sur la situation sécuritaire notamment après les violences à Ippy et la mort d’un casque bleu à Bria, le vote du budget 2017 ainsi que la mise en œuvre du mandat de la MINUSCA.

Sur le vote du budget, le Ministre et porte-parole du Gouvernement a précisé que son montant traduit la volonté du Gouvernement d’en réduire le déficit. « Le budget est moins important mais plus sincère. Avec ce montant, le Gouvernement a souhaité diminuer le déficit budgétaire », a indiqué le ministre et porte-parole, tout en rappelant que le projet de loi de finance a été présenté dans le timing requis. Maxime-Ange Kazagui s’est exprimé sur la rénovation et l’inauguration du building administratif qui abritera quatre ministères. Il a aussi annoncé un don chinois d’une valeur de 13 milliards de francs CFA qui permettra notamment de réhabiliter l’hôpital de l’Amitié et le stade 20.000 places.

Pour sa part, le porte parole de la MINUSCA, Vladimir Monteiro, est revenu sur la nouvelle résolution du Conseil de sécurité qui autorise le renforcement de   l’effectif de la MINUSCA, en vue “d’accroître la flexibilité et la mobilité de la MINUSCA pour lui permettre d’exécuter plus efficacement l’intégralité de son mandat, et, en particulier, la tâche de protection des civils"". Cependant, Monteiro a précisé que « l’arrivée de renforts ne signifie pas pour autant que la MINUSCA a choisi l’option militaire pour résoudre la crise actuelle », d’autant plus que le Conseil souligne le besoin de renforcer l’appui à un dialogue politique inclusif, mené par le Gouvernement centrafricain, et en partenariat avec l’Initiative africaine pour la paix et la réconciliation en RCA.

“La MINUSCA prend toute la mesure de sa mission en appui au Gouvernement et aux autres autorités légitimes centrafricaines en vue de l’effort global dans l’accompagnement de la RCA”, a ajouté Monteiro, en précisant que la résolution 2387 rappelle les responsabilités des autres acteurs pour une sortie de crise, à savoir les autorités centrafricaines, les groupes armés, la société civile, les pays voisins et les partenaires interationaux.

Mme Clementine Sangana, formatrice de ONU-Femmes a animé pendant deux jours sur les techniques de sensibilisation de proximité. Des exercices pratiques sous la houlette de MONUSCO, le PNUD et ONU femmes accompagnés par la police des Nations unies (UNPol) et la CENI ont eu lieu pour permettre aux participants d’assimiler les techniques de sensibilisation. Par exemple, une séance pratique d’usage de méthodes de proximité a eu lieu dans le marché Tshamban diba le samedi 02 Décembre 2017. A cette occasion, les femmes de l’ONG « Action Femmes pour la paix et le développement au Grand Kasaï » déjà habituées à cet exercice ont initié leurs homologues des territoires qui à leur tour se chargeront de dupliquer cette méthode dans leurs zones respectives.

La formation pratique s’est poursuivie le 03 Décembre avec une visite guidée par le Secrétaire Exécutif Provincial de la CENI dans quelques centres d’inscription de la ville de Kananga. Ici, les participantes se sont entretenues avec les requérants, surtout les femmes et ont invité ces dernières à exhorter ceux et celles qui ne sont pas encore enrôlés à se rendre dans les centres proches de leurs résidences, tout en leur rappelant que des centres seront bientôt fermés après 3 mois d’ouverture.

Des séances de travail avec les femmes des territoires afin de mieux les outiller et orienter sur les techniques de sensibilisation de proximité ont conclus cet atelier fort apprécié des participantes.

2363309,"RD Congo : Le nouveau ‘Baromètre sécuritaire du Kivu’ cartographie les violences dans l’est **Plus de 500 personnes tuées et plus de 1000 autres enlevées dans les provinces du Kivu au cours des 6 derniers mois**

(Goma) – Le nouveau [Baromètre sécuritaire du Kivu](https://kivusecurity.org/) cartographiera les violences exercées par les groupes armés et les forces de sécurité étatiques congolaises dans les provinces du Kivu, dans l’est de la [République démocratique du Congo](https://www.hrw.org/fr/afrique/republique-democratique-du-congo), ont fait savoir aujourd’hui Human Rights Watch et le Groupe d’étude sur le Congo de l’Université de New York. Le projet conjoint rendra compte des pires violences commises dans les provinces du Nord et du Sud Kivu à l’aide de cartes, de graphiques et de rapports analytiques.

Selon les premiers résultats du Baromètre, de juin à novembre 2017, au moins 526 civils ont été tués dans les Kivus, au moins 1 087 personnes ont été enlevées ou kidnappées pour obtenir une rançon, et il y a eu au moins 11 incidents de viols massifs.

« Alors que les civils font l’objet d’attaques alarmantes dans l’est de la RD Congo, le Baromètre sécuritaire du Kivu fournira aux décideurs politiques, aux journalistes, aux activistes et autres personnes concernées un nouvel outil innovant permettant de mieux comprendre les violences », a déclaré [Ida Sawyer](https://www.hrw.org/fr/about/people/ida-sawyer), directrice pour l’Afrique centrale à Human Rights Watch. « Nous espérons que le Baromètre sera utilisé pour s’attaquer plus efficacement aux causes profondes du conflit en RD Congo, pour soutenir les communautés affectées et demander des comptes aux responsables. »

Depuis que le Baromètre a commencé à documenter les incidents en juin, une équipe de 14 chercheurs congolais basés au Nord-Kivu et au Sud-Kivu se sont entretenus quotidiennement avec des victimes d’abus et leurs familles, des témoins, des chefs coutumiers, des membres du clergé, des activistes et des agents du gouvernement, afin de documenter les exactions et d’identifier les acteurs armés qui les ont commises. Les collaborateurs du projet en RD Congo et à l’étranger vérifient ensuite leurs rapports auprès de sources fiables avant de publier les incidents sur le site Web, fournissant des comptes-rendus détaillés et précis qui sont mis à jour à mesure que des informations supplémentaires deviennent disponibles.

Le Baromètre enregistre les incidents violents perpétrés par des groupes armés et des membres des forces de sécurité congolaises, à la fois dans des conflits armés et des violences politiques. L’ensemble de données comprend des morts violentes, des affrontements entre groupes armés, des enlèvements, des kidnappings, des viols massifs (soit au moins cinq victimes lors d’une seule attaque), la destruction de biens et la répression de manifestations politiques pacifiques. Près de 800 incidents ont été enregistrés au cours des six premiers mois de suivi.

Le Baromètre vise à promouvoir une meilleure compréhension des événements qui surviennent dans un pays confronté à une violence accrue. L’année dernière, 922 000 personnes ont été déplacées en RD Congo, plus que partout ailleurs dans le monde. En octobre, les Nations Unies ont déclaré un « [Niveau 3 d’urgence](https://www.unocha.org/where-we-work/current-emergencies) »  en RD Congo, une catégorie attribuée seulement à trois autres pays : la Syrie, l’Irak et le Yémen. Le conflit congolais, cependant, est marqué par une énorme complexité – le Baromètre cartographie les zones de contrôle de 120 groupes armés dans seulement deux des 26 provinces du pays. Cela a compliqué la tâche des décideurs s’agissant de concevoir des solutions et celle des médias s’agissant de montrer la réalité derrière les violences, selon les organisations.

Le Baromètre aide à relever ce défi. En mettant en évidence des modèles et des tendances, et à travers une représentation graphique des violences, il vise à rendre le conflit plus compréhensible. Les premiers résultats indiquent qu’une grande partie des violences dans les Kivus ne sont pas signalées. Quatre-vingt-dix pour cent des incidents documentés par le Baromètre, représentant 70 pour cent des morts violentes, n’ont pas été mentionnés du tout dans les médias internationaux. Plus de la moitié de ces incidents sont absents des [meilleurs baromètres de violence universitaires disponibles](https://www.acleddata.com/data/).

Si de nombreux facteurs contribuent à la violence, certaines tendances se dégagent. Les forces de sécurité congolaises ont été responsables de plus de 100 morts violentes au cours des six derniers mois, soit plus que n’importe quel groupe armé et environ un cinquième du nombre total d’homicides documentés. L’un des pires incidents recensés a été le massacre d’au moins 39 réfugiés burundais par les forces de sécurité congolaises à Kamanyola, au Sud-Kivu, le 15 septembre.

Les résultats du Baromètre suggèrent également que le conflit dans l’est de la RD Congo a été exacerbé par la [crise](https://www.hrw.org/fr/blog-feed/la-rd-congo-en-crise) politique générale sévissant dans le pays, alors que le Président Joseph Kabila a retardé les élections et a eu recours à la [violence, à la répression](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2017/12/04/rd-congo-des-rebelles-ont-ete-recrutes-pour-reprimer-les-manifestations), et à la [corruption](https://allthewealth.congoresearchgroup.org/) pour se maintenir au pouvoir au-delà de la limite de deux mandats fixée par la Constitution, qui a pris fin le 19 décembre 2016. Des groupes armés ont formé des coalitions pour contester la prolongation de la présidence de Kabila, tandis que le gouvernement a violemment réprimé des manifestants pacifiques.

« Les niveaux de déplacement en RD Congo aujourd’hui sont les plus élevés jamais enregistrés », a déclaré [Jason Stearns](http://cic.nyu.edu/people/jason-stearns), directeur du Groupe d’étude sur le Congo. « La crise politique actuelle n’est pas seulement une question d’élections, mais elle concerne des millions de personnes touchées par une violence persistante et meurtrière. Résoudre la crise exigera un engagement nuancé dans le conflit, mais également la volonté politique d’interpeler les responsables.",268,"French"

2362939,"Dix-sept millions d'enfants de moins d'un an respirent un air toxique, selon l'UNICEF 6 décembre 2017 – Près de 17 millions d'enfants de moins d'un an vivent dans des régions où la pollution atmosphérique est au moins six fois supérieure aux limites internationales. Une telle exposition force les enfants à respirer un air toxique et met potentiellement le développement de leur cerveau en danger, selon une étude du Fonds des Nations Unies pour l'enfance (UNICEF) publiée mercredi.

L'étude souligne que le fait de respirer des particules de pollution atmosphérique peut endommager le tissu cérébral et ralentir le développement cognitif, engendrant des répercussions et des retards permanents.

« Non seulement la pollution nuit au développement des poumons des bébés, mais elle peut aussi endommager leur cerveau encore inachevé de façon irréversible et, par là même, compromettre leur avenir », a déclaré le Directeur général de l'UNICEF, Anthony Lake, dans un communiqué. « Protéger les enfants de la pollution atmosphérique ne profite pas qu'à eux, mais également à leurs sociétés, en se traduisant par une réduction des coûts en matière de soins de santé, une augmentation de la productivité et un environnement plus sûr et plus salubre pour tout un chacun », a-t-il ajouté.

**Plus des trois quarts des enfants respirant un air toxique vivent en Asie du Sud**

Les images satellites ont révélé que l'Asie du Sud présente la plus forte proportion de bébés vivant dans les régions les plus affectées. 12,2 millions d'entre eux résidant dans des zones où la pollution atmosphérique extérieure est six fois supérieure aux limites internationales fixées par l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS). Ce chiffre s'élève à 4,3 millions dans la région de l'Asie orientale et du Pacifique.

Le rapport de l'UNICEF démontre que la pollution atmosphérique avec ses particules ultrafines, tout comme une alimentation et une stimulation inadéquates, et l'exposition à la violence au cours des 1.000 premiers jours de vie, peut avoir un impact sur le développement des jeunes enfants en affectant leur cerveau en pleine croissance.

Très petites, les particules ultrafines de pollution atmosphérique peuvent pénétrer dans la circulation sanguine et atteindre le cerveau. Le cerveau d'un jeune enfant est particulièrement vulnérable en comparaison à celui d'un adulte, car il peut être endommagé par une plus petite dose de produits chimiques toxiques. Les enfants sont également extrêmement vulnérables à la pollution atmosphérique, car ils respirent plus rapidement et leurs défenses physiques et immunitaires ne sont pas complètement développées.

**Réduire l'impact de la pollution atmosphérique sur le cerveau des enfants**

L'étude de l'UNICEF recommande des mesures d'urgence pour réduire l'impact de la pollution atmosphérique sur le cerveau en développement des bébés, notamment des mesures immédiates que les parents peuvent mettre en œuvre afin de réduire l'exposition de l'enfant aux émanations nocives issues des produits du tabac, des cuisinières et des systèmes de chauffage.

L'agence onusienne recommande ainsi d'investir dans des sources d'énergie plus propre et renouvelable, d'offrir un accès aux transports en commun à un coût abordable, d'augmenter le nombre d'espaces verts dans les zones urbaines et de fournir de meilleures options de gestion des déchets.

L'UNICEF recommande également que les enfants se déplacent pendant des heures où la pollution atmosphérique est plus faible, que des masques filtrants adaptés leurs soient fournis dans les cas extrêmes et de créer un aménagement urbain judicieux pour que les principales sources de pollution ne soient pas situées près des écoles, des cliniques ou des hôpitaux.

Davantage de prévention, le traitement de la pneumonie, la promotion de l'allaitement exclusif au sein et une bonne nutrition peuvent également contribuer à améliorer la santé des enfants et à renforcer ainsi leur résilience, estime le Fonds.

Pour l'agence onusienne, il est essentiel d'améliorer les connaissances sur la pollution atmosphérique. Réduire l'exposition des enfants aux polluants et aux sources de pollution atmosphérique commence avant tout par une compréhension de la qualité de l'air qu'ils respirent, estime l'UNICEF.

« Aucun enfant ne devrait respirer un air dangereusement pollué », a déclaré M. Lake. « Et aucune société ne peut se permettre d'ignorer la pollution atmosphérique ».",268,"French"
2362884,"Célébration de la journée internationale des personnes handicapés à Bamako **Le 3 décembre dernier, devant près de 300 personnes, a eu lieu à l’Ecole de maintien de la paix Alioune Blondin Beye de Bamako, la cérémonie de commémoration de la journée internationale des personnes handicapées.**

La cérémonie a été présidée par le Dr. Zoumana Diarra, représentant du Ministre des droits de l’homme et de la Réforme de l’Etat, empêché. Elle a également enregistré la présence entre autre de la Présidente de la Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme, du représentant du Médiateur de la République, de la Directrice d’Amnesty International Mali, du Représentant de la Fédération Malienne des Personnes Handicapées, du Représentant du Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme et Directeur de la Division des droits de l’homme et de la protection de la MINUSMA.

Près de trois cent personnes, dont plusieurs jeunes activistes des droits de l’homme des membres du Forum National pour l’Education aux droits de l’homme au Mali, des membres des clubs des droits de l’homme de dix lycées et de trois centres de prise en charge d’éducation des enfants à besoins spécifiques, ont également participé activement à cette journée.

La présidence de la Commission Nationale des droits de l’homme, la MINUSMA et le Ministère des droits de l’homme et de la Réforme de l’Etat ont tous souligné l’importance des droits de l’homme. Ainsi, toutes les allocutions ont exhorté à militer en faveur de la jouissance effective de tous les droits de l’homme par les personnes handicapées. Le Gouvernement a été invité à mieux promouvoir, respecter et protéger les droits des personnes handicapées. Ce dernier pour sa part, a réaffirmé  son engagement en la matière.

Le message de M. Guillaume Ngefa, Représentant du Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme au Mali et Directeur de la Division des droits de l’homme et de la protection s’est surtout adressé aux enfants et aux jeunes qui sont, selon lui, le présent, pour l’avenir. Il a invité les membres des clubs droits de l'homme à participer aux activités de sensibilisation sur les droits des personnes handicapées et à l’exercice du plaidoyer que la Division des droits de l’homme et de la Protection compte conduire auprès des parlementaires, pour l’adoption d’une loi sur la protection sociale des personnes handicapées. Il a mis l'accent sur l'obligation pour chacun de nous de promouvoir les droits fondamentaux des personnes handicapées, afin de favoriser leur intégration et leur accès à la vie politique, économique, sociale et culturelle. Il a attiré l’attention sur la situation particulière des femmes et des enfants handicapés souvent exposés à de multiples discriminations, et victimes de préjugés et de pratiques dangereuses.

Les discours officiels ont été suivis de prestations de sketchs, poèmes et slam par les représentants des lycées, portant sur des messages forts pour la protection des droits des personnes handicapées, le droit à l’éducation, le droit pour les enfants vivant avec handicap, le droit à l’égalité et la protection contre la discrimination.

*« A la veille de la campagne annuelle pour les 70 ans de la déclaration universelle des droits de l’homme, il est important pour nous de garder à l’esprit que tous les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux en dignité et en droits ; Et que les droits des personnes handicapées sont des droits de l’homme. »* Conclut-il.",268,"French"
2362879,"Comprendre la violence électorale pour mieux la prévenir **Si la plupart  des échéances électorales des dernières années en Afrique de l’Ouest  se sont déroulées pacifiquement et librement, divers actes de violences ont pu cependant se produire. Quelle est la nature de cette violence et comment faire pour l’éradiquer définitivement ?**

Depuis les années 90  les  échéances électorales en Afrique de l’Ouest ont souvent été une occasion d’expression forte de violence. Le Togo en 2005, le Nigeria en 2007, la Côte d’Ivoire en 2010-2011, la Guinée en 2010, pour ne citer que ces pays, … ont connu des fortunes diverses. Cette violence, connue aussi bien des populations, des acteurs politiques, des dirigeants que de la communauté internationale, prend ses racines dans divers paramètres historiques, politiques, et socio-économiques., Cerner ces paramètres, permettrait de mieux agir en amont et prévenir.

La violence électorale est,  une variante de la violence politique. Cependant, la violence électorale peut être distinguée de la famille de la violence politique, par son objectif particulier. Elle cherche en effet à influencer la conduite des électeurs, des candidats ou à travestir les résultats des élections. Pour ce faire, elle tente de retarder, d’empêcher le vote ou la compilation des suffrages, pour des résultats qui ne reflètent pas la vérité des urnes.

La violence électorale ainsi observée peut avoir lieu pendant n’importe quelle étape du cycle électoral. Elle peut se produire par exemple avant ou pendant  le jour du scrutin, comme ce fut le cas lors des élections en Guinée en 2010. Elle peut aussi avoir lieu juste au lendemain des élections, comme lors de l’élection présidentielle au Togo en 2005 et même en Côte d’Ivoire en 2010.

**Sur les origines et les causes de la violence électorale**

Beaucoup d’analystes s’accordent à souligner que les élections ne sont pas la cause première de la violence. Les scrutins électoraux sont, en effet, beaucoup plus perçus comme catalyseur ou accélérateur du déclenchement de la violence. Toutefois, elles risquent d’intensifier les tensions existantes, en particulier lorsqu’ils ne sont pas tenues de façon crédible. Les causes lointaines de la violence électorale sont souvent à rechercher dans les situations de crises peu, mal ou non gérées.
Elle est plus fréquente dans les pays qui sortent d’une instabilité politique, d’une guerre civile ou d’un coup d’Etat. Les élections dans de tels contextes viennent raidir les positions des acteurs précédemment en conflit qui trouve en la violence, le seul outil pour s’exprimer. Il faut aussi noter que les violences électorales s’expriment davantage dans un contexte de transition démocratique ou de désarmement et de démobilisation suite à une guerre civile ; de manipulation réelle ou perçue des élections ; d’enjeux importants qui met en présence des ethnies, des clans, des puissances économiques en plus des acteurs politiques ; d’un écart non important entre les candidats ;  d’un cadre juridique peu clair ou contesté ; des organes de gestion partisane ; du manque de transparence, y compris à propos des données électorales, de preuve ou perception de fraude lors du processus électoral ; d’un système uninominal majoritaire à un tour, d’exclusion de communautés spécifiques pendant le processus électoral.

**Les déclencheurs et la manifestation**

La violence électorale est déclenchée pendant la période électorale quand des parties en position de force ou de faiblesse constatent que l’autre partie établit de manière unilatérale les règles du jeu électoral qui la favorisent. Les sujets sur lesquels ce déclenchement est plus rapide restent : la mise en place du fichier électoral, la mise en place de l’administration électorale et les résultats électoraux. La violence électorale se manifeste par des actes tels que : la violation du cadre juridique ; les paroles blessantes ou indécentes ; les assassinats ; les coups et blessures entre supporters rivaux ; l’intimidation des adversaires, des électeurs ou des agents électoraux ; le bourrage des urnes ; l’exclusion de communautés. Les actes de violence peuvent donc être ciblées contre : des personnes, qu’il s’agisse d’individus, de communautés ou même de candidats ; des matériels en l’occurrence, le matériel de campagne, les véhicules, les bureaux, les bureaux de vote,... Il existe donc entre autres : la violence électorale verbale et symbolique, la violence électorale psychologique, la violence électorale physique et la violence électorale structurelle ou institutionnelle. Dans l’un ou l’autre des cas, les électeurs peuvent être empêchés de participer au vote, contraints de choisir un candidat contre leur gré. Le résultat est que les élections seront soient perturbées soient annulées d’emblée.

**Quelle approche pour prévenir la violence électorale ?**

La prévention de la violence électorale invite sans doute à travailler sur les périodes de son expression, c’est-à-dire : avant, pendant et après les élections.

Avant les élections, il s’agit d’instaurer la confiance entre toutes les parties prenantes, pour l’établissement des règles de la compétition, autrement du cadre juridique et légal, qui garantit l’intégrité du processus électoral. Les actions à mener pendant cette phase incluent aussi la mise en place consensuelle de l’organe qui sera chargée d’organiser le scrutin. L’administration électorale, comprenant peu ou pas d’acteurs politiques, doit offrir à toutes les parties engagées le gage d’une compétition saine, équitable et juste.  La mise en place consensuelle de la liste électorale, la production en toute transparence et la distribution effective des cartes d’électeurs permettent aussi d’éteindre de potentielles sources de conflits.

Pendant la période électorale qui coure depuis les campagnes électorales jusqu’à la proclamation des résultats, la transparence est requise pour toutes les opérations électorales qui sont menées. L’administration électorale a une grande responsabilité dans cette mission qui lui incombe d’ailleurs en premier. Elle devrait non seulement prendre ses décisions après concertations avec les parties, mais devrait aussi les publier en temps opportun. Aussi,  elle doit s’assurer que les résultats détaillés des élections soient rapidement affichés, publiés du niveau le plus bas de la chaine électorale (bureau de vote) jusqu’au niveau le plus élevé (la circonscription électorale qui peut être, selon la circonstance le quartier de ville, la commune, le département ou le pays entier). De façon pratique, des mesures de protection contre la fraude le jour de l’élection qui aident à réduire le potentiel de violence comprennent le maintien du secret du vote, la numérotation des bulletins de vote et la manipulation sécurisée du matériel électoral.

Après la proclamation des résultats, vient la gestion de la période post-électorale. Elle est un peu plus délicate dans le cas de la contestation des résultats, par l’une ou l’autre des parties. Cette phase exige une impartialité du système judiciaire qui a la plus grande responsabilité. En effet, lorsque s’ouvre le contentieux électoral, l’institution chargée de trancher les différends ne doit prendre, ni donner l’impression de prendre, fait et cause pour l’une ou l’autre des parties.

Après l’inventaire de ses différentes actions qui sont propres à chaque phase du scrutin pour prévenir la violence électorale, il faut souligner qu’il y a d’autres dont l’accomplissement ne doit pas se limiter à une phase du processus. Leur intérêt est capital et elles demeurent transversales. Il est en effet question : d’évaluer la présence et la gravité des problèmes et griefs politiques et sociaux de longue date; réfléchir et mettre en œuvre des politiques de résolution de ces différends ; d’améliorer le processus électoral pour plus de transparence ; de travailler pour créer et entretenir la confiance. Les partis politiques et les institutions de la République se doivent aussi d’éduquer les populations et surtout les potentiels électeurs aux bonnes pratiques électorales.

**La contribution des outils régionaux et internationaux**

Pour renforcer l’exercice de la démocratie, entretenir la paix et éliminer la violence y compris électorale, la Communauté Economique des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (CEDEAO) a mis en place un certain nombre de mécanismes comme le Protocole Additionnel sur la Démocratie et la Bonne Gouvernance, Le Protocole propose une adhésion stricte aux normes constitutionnelles dans les pratiques électorales. Il rejette par voie de conséquence l’accession ou le maintien anticonstitutionnel au pouvoir, et définit les paramètres pour la conduite d’élections pacifiques et crédibles qui soient libres, équitables et transparentes.

L’Union Africaine participe aussi à la réduction de la violence électorale à travers son Protocole d’accord sur la sécurité, la stabilité, le développement et la coopération de 2002. Ce protocole indique que les élections transparentes et crédibles constituent un élément important qui favorise le respect du droit fondamental et universel à la gouvernance participative et démocratique. Il rejette aussi les changements non constitutionnels de gouvernements.

En coordination avec les diverses organisations régionales, les Nations Unies, à travers le UNOWAS et les différentes agences, ne ménagent pas leur effort et soutien pour aider à éradiquer la violence électorale et renforcer la bonne gouvernance en Afrique de l’Ouest.",268,"French"

« Cette maison d’arrêt contribuera à la résolution des problèmes au nombre desquels ; le désengorgement de la chambre de sureté de la brigade de gendarmerie, l’évasion massive au niveau de l’unité de la police judiciaire et l’amélioration des conditions de détention des personnes privées de liberté en garantissant leurs droits humains et en les traitant avec humanité », a-t-il déclaré. 

Pour l’évêque de Bossangoa, par ailleurs président du comité préfectoral de « Cohésion Sociale », Monseigneur Nestor Nongo Aziagbia, les machines reçues vont contribuer à la formation et au relèvement socio-économique des jeunes. « Ces machines de productions de tuiles et de briques de capacité de 2200 briques en 8 heures, une fois installées serviront à l’apprentissage et à l’autonomisation de la jeunesse. On travaillera en toute transparence pour faire bénéficier les jeunes de cette formation dans la production de briques, et les revenus de cette production leur permettront de se prendre en charge », promet-t-il.
 
Quant au chef de Bureau de la MINUSCA de Bossangoa par intérim, Abraham Osong, par ailleurs coordonnateur du Bureau régionale des droits de l’homme, il a rappelé que ce geste s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’appui de la MINUSCA au gouvernement centrafricain dans la restauration de l’autorité de l’Etat, de la lutte contre l’impunité et de la promotion de la paix ainsi que du renforcement de la cohésion sociale.
 
« C’est quatre projets à impact rapide qu’on vous a remis aujourd’hui est la preuve que la MINUSCA est au chevet de la République centrafricaine pour un retour rapide et définitif à la normalité. D’autres projets sont en cours pour renforcer la lutte contre l’impunité et mettre en confiance les justiciables », a-t-il indiqué. 

Pour sa part, le préfet de l’Ouham, Marcel Guela, après avoir remercié la MINUSCA pour ses appuis multiformes, a exhorté les jeunes et la population à prendre grand soin des machines et des bâtiments inaugurés. M. Guela a aussi attiré l’attention de tous sur la fonctionnalité de la prison de Bossangoa car, selon lui, sans justice il n’y a pas d’autorité de l’Etat. Il fait également valoir que « cette maison d’arrêt est une bonne chose car elle permettra de mettre de l’ordre en redressant les délinquants et ceux qu’ils ne veulent pas respecter les lois de la République ».
 
La remise des projets a pris fin par l’explication du fonctionnement des machines de production de briques et de tuiles et de la visite guidée respective de la direction régionale des travaux publics, de la tribune du stade « David Dacko » et de la Maison d’arrêt et de correction de Bossangoa.",268,"French"

Le Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies et Chef de la MINUSCA, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, la Représentante spéciale adjointe, Najat Rochdi, le Commandant de la Force de la MINUSCA, le Lieutenant-général Balla Keita,  ont participé à cette cérémonie d’adieux au quartier général de la MINUSCA à Bangui le 6 décembre 2017.

Après la marche funèbre exécutée par un détachement du contingent égyptien et qui a salué l’arrivée de la dépouille, l’oraison funèbre du  défunt a été prononcée par le  Major  Armia Nazmy qui commandait le convoi pris en embuscade le jour fatal. Celui-ci a salué « le courage et le dévouement d’un vrai soldat » et a ajouté qu’ « il meurt en paix pour le sacrifice de sa vie,  donné pour sauver un peuple. »

La prière musulmane, assurée par l’Imam Ahmat Salama, suivie d’une minute de silence en la mémoire du défunt ont précédé le dépôt de gerbes faites successivement par Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, le Lieutenant-général Balla Keita et le Commandant du contingent égyptien, le Lieutenant-Colonel Amr Sabri.

Puis le Chef de la MINUSCA a salué « la mémoire d’un héros » ;  « un de plus à qui nous rendons un hommage prématuré », a-t-il dit, ajoutant : « cela nous rappelle les conditions de précarité dans lesquelles nous servons ce pays… » Puis, Parfait-Onanga-Anyanga a invité l’assistance à avoir une « pensée pour  la femme et les enfants du défunt  qui ne le reverront plus jamais ». Mais, a-t-il dit à l’adresse du Major Armia  Nazmy, « dites à sa famille qu’elle peut être fier de ce héros ! »

Le «Projet Santé» travaillera en partenariat avec le gouvernement haïtien pour soutenir le système de santé du pays et étendre les soins de santé essentiels à 4,2 millions de personnes.

En dépensant 98,5 millions de dollars au cours des quatre prochaines années, le «Projet Santé», un accord de coopération entre l’Agence Américaine pour le Développement International (USAID), et Caris Foundation International, augmentera le nombre d’Haïtiens recevant des soins de santé essentiels et de qualité.  Dans le cadre d’une approche axée sur le patient, le projet offrira des soins materno-infantiles intégrés aux familles haïtiennes, particulièrement la vaccination, la santé reproductive, les services de nutrition et la prévention, les soins et le traitement du VIH.

Le projet sera dirigé par Caris Foundation et implémenté en partenariat avec un consortium de partenaires comprenant le Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB), et la Haitian Health Foundation (HHF). Avec le support de l’USAID, le consortium développera des stratégies qui ont fait leur preuve afin d’améliorer les services de santé communautaires et dans les établissements sanitaires et augmentera la capacité des partenaires haïtiens locaux à tirer parti des réalisations et des meilleures pratiques du projet.

**Copie** aux Chefs d’Etats et de gouvernement de l’Union européenne 

Madame, Messieurs 

1.Le Comité des Observateurs des Droits de l’Homme France (CODHO France) est une association française créée depuis 2005, dont le but principal est la promotion et la protection des droits de l’homme et apporter assistance aux victimes. Nous voulons vous interpeller ici sur vos responsabilités respectives par rapport aux actuels actes de cruautés graves en Libye, dans les pays de l’Afrique du Nord et au Tchad.

2.Les actuels actes d’horreurs dont subissent les réfugiés et les autres migrants présents en Libye devraient interpeller l’Union européenne et ses représentants, ainsi que les autorités des 28 Etats membres. CODHO constante qu’au-delà d’une politique funeste obsédée par le désir de repousser toujours plus loin les réfugiés et autres migrants et à l’extérieur des frontières européennes, quitte à obstruer les opérations de sauvetage en mer Méditerranée, l’Union européenne et les autorités de certains Etats membres de l’Union et des agences ou organisations opérant avec l’appui ou sous le label de l’Union européenne entretiendraient un réseau criminel contre les migrants et réfugiés noirs africains en Libye, dans d’autres pays de l’Afrique du Nord, ainsi que sur les côtes de ceux-ci et au Tchad.

3.En Libye en particulier, mais aussi dans les autres pays de l’Afrique du Nord, et au Tchad, il est de notoriété publique que le système de détention des candidats au refuge sur le sol européen est abject. Ces migrants et réfugiés noirs africains constituent une entreprise prospère des tueries, d’enlèvement, de viol, de torture et d’extorsion. En choisissant sciemment de contenir à tout prix les réfugiés et autres migrants noirs africains en Libye, l’Union européenne, les autorités de certains Etats membres de l’Union et des agences ou organisations opérant la mer et bénéficiant de l’appui ou agissant sous le label de l’Union européenne endossent directement ou indirectement ces crimes graves commis sur les noirs en Libye, dans d’autres pays de l’Afrique du Nord et au Tchad.

4.CODHO note qu’il n’est pourtant pas concevable que des migrants et réfugiés noirs africains puissent être renvoyés actuellement en Libye ou dans un autre pays de l’Afrique du Nord et au Tchad, comme il est intolérable qu’ils soient contraints d’y rester.

5.Par ailleurs, l’Accord du 18 mars 2016 entre la Turquie et l’Union européenne dont le but est de réduire la migration irrégulière vers l’Europe est à la base des actes horreurs tant dans le pays de départ, notamment en Grèce que dans le pays d’arrivé en Turquie. On ne peut croire que l’Union européenne dont plusieurs Etats membres développement des politiques migratoires cohérentes et humaines puisse conclure à la création de ce que l’on peut aujourd’hui appeler nouveaux « camps de concentration » sur le territoire européen ou en Turquie contre des réfugiés et autres migrants.

6.CODHO ne peut pas rester insensible aux actes de cruautés commis à l’encontre des réfugiés et autres migrants noirs africains en Libye, dans les autres pays de l’Afrique du Nord et au Tchad. Il en est de mêmes des actes d’horreur commis sur les réfugiés et autres migrants de l’Asie vers l’Europe, pour la plupart, en Grèce et en Turquie.

7.Compte tenu de ce qui précède, CODHO demande instamment aux autorités de l’Union européenne à (de, d’): 

a-prendre urgemment des mesures administratives, politiques et juridiques qui s’imposent afin de mettre un terme à l’actuelle tragédie humaine du siècle, planifiée et programmée, contre les réfugiés et autres migrants, notamment noirs africains vers l’Europe, et venir urgemment au secours des victimes survivantes ; sur la mer méditerranée, en Afrique et sur le territoire européen ; 

b-urgenter une enquête indépendante sur les allégations de ces crimes graves contre les réfugiés et autres migrants noirs africains en Libye, dans les autres pays de l’Afrique du Nord et au Tchad, traduire en justice les présumés coupables, et indemniser les victimes survivantes. 

c-urgenter une enquête indépendante sur les allégations de ces crimes graves contre les réfugiés et autres migrants vers l’Europe, notamment dans les camps dits de concentration dans tous les pays de transit, en particulier en Grèce et en Turquie, traduire en justice les présumés coupables, et indemniser les victimes survivantes.

8.Pour qu’aucun n’Etat membre n’en prétexte l’ignorance, CODHO prenons soins de copier la présente lettre ouverte à chaque Chef d’Etat et de gouvernement des 28 pays membres de l’Union européenne, par le biais de son Ambassadeur (drice) accrédité-e en France à Paris, et au président de la République française.

9.Veuillez agréer, Madame, Messieurs, l’assurance de notre considération distinguée.

2361834,"Etude de faisabilité des interventions monétaires dans le cadre du mécanisme RRM en RCA: Mission CashCap, Septembre - Octobre 2017 **1. Contexte**

La crise centrafricaine, débutée en 2013, a provoqué des nombreux déplacements de population dus à l’insécurité qui en a résulté. Si la situation semble vouloir se normaliser à Bangui, bien que des mouvements de contestations populaires surgissent régulièrement dans la capitale, l’insécurité persiste en province, et notamment dans les zones frontalières à l’ouest et au nord du pays ainsi que sur la zone diagonale Batangafo – Bambari qui sépare le pays. Les zones d’insécurité causant des chocs et donc des mouvements de population restent liées à la présence géographique des groupes armés.

Le Mécanisme de Réponse Rapide (RRM) est un programme humanitaire qui garantit une veille humanitaire, réalise des évaluations multisectorielles, des distributions de biens non alimentaires (NFI) et des interventions en eau, hygiène et assainissement (EHA) d’urgence lorsque les acteurs et capacités nécessaires ne sont pas disponibles sur place.

Le RRM existe dans le pays depuis 2013 et est actuellement mis en œuvre par trois ONGs internationales, sous le leadership, la coordination et le financement de l’UNICEF ; chaque ONG ayant une zone d’activités : Action Contre la Faim à l’ouest et nord-ouest de la RCA, Solidarités International au nord, et ACTED à l’est et sud-est. En 2017, le RRM a souhaité explorer l’approche basée sur les marchés à la place de la distribution en nature des biens non-alimentaires (NFI) utilisée depuis 2013, à l’instar du mécanisme semblable existant en RDC depuis dix ans.

**2. Objectifs**

Les principaux objectifs de la mission CashCap en RCA étaient :

- Identifier la meilleure approche basée sur les marchés pour appuyer les bénéficiaires du RRM avec des non-vivres ;

- Identifier les villes qui peuvent être utilisées comme pilote pour une approche basée sur les marchés dans le secteur des non-vivres ;

- Identifier les arguments pour et contre chaque approche dans le contexte spécifique du pays.  

Les principales tâches découlant de ces objectifs étaient :

- Fournir une analyse initiale des marchés ;

- Fournir une analyse initiale des risques opérationnels et de protection ;

- Conseiller sur les mécanismes de transfert possibles dans le cas de la RCA ;

- Renforcer les capacités des partenaires RRM en matière d’intervention monétaire ;

- Identifier des modalités de renforcement de la coordination des interventions monétaires en RCA.",268,"French"

- Mouvements de population continus et retours timides en Territoire de Fizi  

- Les premiers réfugiés burundais sont arrivés sur le nouveau site de Mulongwe

**Aperçu de la situation** 

Nouveaux déplacements de population, manque d’abris, d’articles ménagers essentiels ou encore de nourriture : la situation humanitaire reste très inquiétante en Territoire de Fizi. Le 30 novembre, la totalité des 5 000 habitants de Lumanya, à environ 45 kilomètres de Fizi centre, ont dû fuir dans la forêt en raison d’affrontements entre des groupes armés et l’armée congolaise, affirment des sources locales. Dans le village voisin de Mukera, plus de 90% de la population est toujours en déplacement après les violences qui ont eu lieu les 9 et 10 novembre entre les acteurs précités. Seul environ 1 000 des 13 500 habitants sont revenus à Mukera selon les résultats préliminaires de la mission menée du 29 novembre au 3 décembre dans la zone - et ce retour pourrait bien se révéler temporaire en raison de l’insécurité latente, qui risque de les forcer à se déplacer à nouveau.  

La situation est également préoccupante à Simbi, situé à quelques kilomètres de Mukera. D’une part, 60% des 6 800 habitants de l’aire de santé de Simbi se seraient déplacés en novembre par peur des affrontements à Mukera. Mais la zone a aussi accueilli de nombreux déplacés qui fuyait justement Mukera, directement touché par les affrontements.  

Déplacés et retournés vivent dans des conditions très précaires soulignent les premières conclusions de la mission du 3 décembre. Les déplacés tentent pour la plupart de survivre grâce à la nourriture ou aux quelques francs gagnés en échange du travail journalier qu’ils fournissent aux champs. La plupart des enfants déplacés ne sont pas scolarisés faute de moyens financiers. Les retournés ainsi que la population résidente accèdent difficilement à leurs champs en raison de l’insécurité et partagent le peu de ressources à disposition avec les déplacés.  

Toujours dans le Territoire de Fizi, le nouveau site de Mulongwe a accueilli le 29 novembre dernier ses premiers réfugiés burundais en provenance du centre de transit de Monge Monge, proche de Baraka. Le transfert d’autres réfugiés devraient se poursuivre dans les prochaines semaines sur ce site d’une capacité initiale de 5 000 personnes. Pour mémoire, son ouverture avait été retardée en raison de l’insécurité dans la zone.",268,"French"
2361709,"Le coût de la faim en Afrique : l’incidence sociale et économique de la sous-nutrition chez l’enfant au Mali **Résumé**

L’étude sur le coût de la faim en Afrique (CDFA) est une initiative régionale menée par la Commission de l’Union Africaine à travers laquelle les pays sont en mesure d’estimer l’impact social et économique de la sous-nutrition chez l’enfant pour une année donnée. Au vu de l’importance des questions de nutrition pour le Mali, le Gouvernement a décidé de mettre en oeuvre cette étude afin d’apprécier les conséquences sociales et économiques de la sous-nutrition des enfants de moins de cinq ans dans le pays.

L’étude montre que la sous-nutrition chez l’enfant n’est pas seulement un problème social mais aussi économique, puisque les pertes annuelles dues à la sous-nutrition passée et présente des enfants sont considérables. Les résultats de l’étude CDFA réalisée dans les pays de la première phase ont été présentés en mars 2012 aux Ministres africains des finances, de la planification et du développement économique, réunis à Addis-Abeba (Ethiopie). Ces derniers ont adopté la Résolution 898 dans laquelle ils ont confirmé l’importance de l’étude et recommandé sa poursuite au-delà de sa phase initiale.

Les données utilisées pour l’étude ont été essentiellement recueillies auprès de l’Institut National de la Statistique (INSTAT) et d’autres structures telles que la Direction Nationale de la Santé, la Direction Nationale de la Population, les Ministères de l’Economie et des Finances, de la Santé et de l’Hygiène Publique, de l’Education Nationale. Les principaux documents nationaux exploités sont : EDS (2012 - 2013) ; RGPH (1998 et 2009) ; RESEN (2015), Comptes Nationaux de la Santé (2013), L’EMOP (2015); les Annuaires statistiques de l’éducation (2013), de la santé (2013) et de l’INSTAT.

Des données complémentaires ont été recueillies dans la base de données de la Division de la population des Nations unies, la base de données des indicateurs du développement dans le monde de la Banque mondiale, l’Observatoire de la santé de l’OMS. En outre, une collecte de données primaires a été réalisée, notamment au niveau du secteur de la santé.

La magnitude des coûts sociaux et économiques engendrés par la sous-nutrition indique l’urgence pour l’Etat malien à mobiliser davantage d’efforts pour réduire de manière significative le niveau et les effets de la sous-nutrition. Pour cela, il est nécessaire de :

- Démontrer un engagement national visible et soutenu à conduire les efforts de réduction de la sous-nutrition à travers un leadership fort ;

- Fixer des cibles ambitieuses en matière de réduction de la sous-nutrition en lien avec les Objectifs de Développement Durable (ODD) et celui de l’Union africaine qui vise un niveau régional du retard de croissance de 10% d’ici à 2025;

- Prendre des engagements concrets pour accroitre les ressources domestiques et extérieures allouées à la lutte contre la sous-nutrition des enfants, en particulier, financer le Plan d’Action Multisectoriel de Nutrition (2014-2018) ;

- Soutenir la communication et le plaidoyer en faveur de la nutrition auprès du Gouvernement et des partenaires au développement.",268,"French"
2361679,"Cadre pour la mise en œuvre de la “stratégie de l'OMS pour mettre fin à la tuberculose” dans la région africaine au cours de la période 2016 - 2020 **Situation actuelle** 

La Région africaine continue de supporter une part importante de la charge mondiale de tuberculose, soit 28 % des 9,6 millions de cas incidents de tuberculose survenus dans le monde en 2014. Entre 2000 et 2014, la mise en œuvre des stratégies DOTS et Halte à la tuberculose par les États Membres a permis de sauver environ 10,1 millions de vies dans la Région africaine. De 2000 à 2014, la Région a également enregistré une baisse de 37 % du taux de mortalité par tuberculose, lequel taux a diminué de 47 % chez les personnes vivant avec le VIH. Le taux de succès thérapeutique cible fixé à 85 % en 2015 dans la Stratégie Halte à la tuberculose a été atteint par 21 États Membres6 , alors que la moyenne régionale s’établit à 79 %.  

La Région africaine abrite 74 % de tous les patients tuberculeux VIH-positifs (1,2 million) notifiés dans le monde en 2014. Et ce, malgré un certain nombre d’avancées telles que la forte augmentation des interventions de collaboration contre la co-infection VIH/tuberculose qui ont été mises en œuvre en faveur de plus de 90 % des patients tuberculeux diagnostiqués positifs pour le VIH dans 24 pays; la réalisation d’une couverture par la thérapie antirétrovirale de 77 % chez les patients tuberculeux co-infectés par le VIH ; l’administration du traitement préventif au cotrimoxazole à 89 % des patients ; et une baisse de 47 % de la mortalité chez les patients tuberculeux VIH-positifs de 2000 à 2014.  

Selon les estimations de l’OMS, la Région africaine a enregistré entre 32 000 et 49 000 cas de tuberculose multirésistante en 20147. Grâce à la prise en charge programmatique élargie de la tuberculose pharmacorésistante dans les pays, on a pu dépister 26 531 (soit 83 %) des 32 000 cas estimatifs de tuberculose multirésistante chez les patients tuberculeux notifiés en 2014. Soixante-huit pour cent des cas diagnostiqués ont été placés sous traitement, mais avec un taux de succès thérapeutique moyen, peu satisfaisant, de 55 % en 2012 (la dernière année pour laquelle des données sont disponibles). La tuberculose multirésistante continue donc de poser un problème de santé publique à cause des lacunes dans le dépistage et l’accès au traitement.  

Le nombre de centres de microscopie de la tuberculose est passé de 10 469 en 2009 à 15 200 à la fin de 2014. Vingt-huit États Membres8 ont atteint le ratio de référence de l’OMS concernant la couverture des laboratoires de microscopie, fixé à un pour 100 000 habitants, tandis que 15 pays ont respecté la norme d’un laboratoire de culture pour cinq millions d’habitants9 , et seulement 10 États Membres ont réussi à se doter d’un laboratoire de test de pharmacosensibilité pour cinq millions d’habitants10. L’OMS recommande d’abandonner la microscopie au profit des méthodes de diagnostic rapide. Il est encore plus difficile d’obtenir une couverture optimale en recourant au diagnostic rapide.",268,"French"
2361564,"Réduction des Risques de Catastrophes : un axe stratégique prioritaire aux Antilles **La réflexion menée sur le renforcement des capacités de la Croix-Rouge française et sur la mise en place d’un dispositif de réduction des risques récurrents de catastrophes concerne toute la zone des Antilles. En effet, celle-ci est exposée aux ouragans, séismes, inondations, et est d’autant plus vulnérable qu’elle est composée de nombreuses petites îles isolées.**

Les trois ouragans successifs survenus en septembre dernier (Irma, José et Maria) ont affecté au total 17 territoires de 9 pays et 8 territoires d’Outremer (français, britanniques, néerlandais et américains). Ces événements ont mis en exergue les vulnérabilités des îles du Nord, à la fois éloignées et privées de moyens de réponse. Ils ont également montré le rôle essentiel de la PIRAC, à l’échelon national et international. La Fédération internationale des sociétés de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (FICR) lui a confié le suivi des catastrophes sur les Petites Antilles. La PIRAC a ainsi assuré un soutien logistique capital à La Dominique, dévastée par l’ouragan Maria, le 20 septembre dernier, mais aussi sur Anguilla, grâce à ses stocks pré-positionnés en Guyane, Martinique et Guadeloupe.

UNE EXPERTISE ‘’MAISON’’

La Croix-Rouge française peut miser sur son expertise en matière de sensibilisation et de préparation aux risques de catastrophes naturelles. Plusieurs projets sont menés ailleurs et à l’échelon international pouvant être adaptés aux Antilles.

Le projet « **Paré pas paré** » mené par la Plateforme d’intervention régionale Océan Indien (PIROI) de la Croix-Rouge française à La Réunion porte sur des actions de sensibilisation des enfants en milieu scolaire, des familles et du grand public. Il peut facilement être dupliqué aux Antilles. Citons également le projet « **72 heures** » mené par la plateforme d’intervention régionale pour la zone Amérique-Caraïbes (PIRAC) sur la zone Caraïbes qui permet aux habitants des îles isolées d’avoir une autonomie de trois jours jusqu’à l’arrivée des premières équipes d’urgence, grâce à des stocks pré-positionnés et la formation préalable des différents acteurs du territoire.

En termes de préparation aux catastrophes, la Croix-Rouge française peut  également s’appuyer sur son expérience à l’international (Caraïbes, Pacifique sud, Océan Indien…), notamment dans le secteur de l’habitat et de la construction d’abris d’urgence, via des outils développés au sein du Mouvement international et des formations dispensées aux acteurs de l’urgence humanitaire.

Différentes pistes sont donc actuellement à l’étude. Toutes les directions métiers et acteurs Croix-Rouge impliqués dans l’opération Irma sont convaincus d’une chose : il faut renforcer encore le travail de coordination régionale. Cette complémentarité des compétences, constatée durant toute la phase d’urgence, est le gage de notre efficacité.

**Les événements**:  
Trois ouragans d’ampleur exceptionnelle frappent les Caraïbes, à quelques semaines d’intervalle :  
- **Dans la nuit du 5 au 6 septembre**, Irma, classé 5 dévaste l’île de Saint-Martin et, dans une moindre mesure, celle de Saint-Barthélemy. Sint Maarten, Anguilla et  Barbuda subissent également des dégâts importants.   
- **Le 9 septembre**, un second ouragan, José, de catégorie 4, épargne les territoires antillais mais contraint nos équipes au confinement et retarde l’arrivée de renforts.   
- **Le 20 septembre**, un troisième ouragan, Maria, de catégorie 5, impacte le sud de la Guadeloupe et l’Etat de La Dominique, totalement dévasté.

**Une réponse anticipée, au siège et sur le terrain**  
- **Dès le jeudi 31 août**, des contacts entre les directions concernées du siège et les acteurs locaux ont lieu à l’approche de l’ouragan Irma.  
- **Le 4 septembre**, la Croix-Rouge française active sa cellule de crise nationale.  
- **Le 5 septembre**, un premier binôme de conseillers techniques nationaux opérationnels (CTNO) est envoyé en Guadeloupe.  
- **Le 6 septembre**, un appel à dons est lancé en prévision d’une catastrophe qui s’annonce majeure.  
- **Le 8 septembre**, un Poste de Commandement National Avancé (PCNA) est installé à Pointe-à-Pitre, soutenu par la Cellule arrière départementale (CAD) de la délégation territoriale de Guadeloupe. Un poste de commandement est basé à Saint-Martin et une équipe envoyée en renfort à Saint-Barthélemy.  
- **Le 9 septembre**, un centre d’accueil des impliqués est mis en place à l’aéroport de Pointe-à-Pitre.",268,"French"
2361539,"Trois mois après Irma **Après une phase d’urgence et d’accompagnement de la population qui aura duré huit semaines, il s’agit désormais de se projeter vers la reconstruction de Saint-Martin, fortement impacté par l’ouragan Irma**.

Les actions de post-urgence mises en place fin octobre -début novembre, découlent d’un travail d’évaluation minutieux réalisé à différentes étapes de la phase d’urgence, qui a permis de cibler les besoins prioritaires. Les personnes âgées isolées et dépendantes ont fait l’objet d’une attention particulière, de même que les populations les plus précaires. Il faut, par ailleurs, appuyer et renforcer les délégations territoriales des Antilles, elles-mêmes impactées par les ouragans. En effet, ces événements ont révélé un certain nombre de vulnérabilités préexistantes et mis en exergue la nécessité de développer nos dispositifs de prévention, de préparation et de gestion des crises dans cette région particulièrement exposée. 

1. NOS ACTIONS À SAINT-MARTIN :

Le projet Ecureuil consiste à distribuer des coupons d’achat à 2 000 ménages particulièrement vulnérables (via une commission d’attribution pilotée par la Croix-Rouge française) pour assurer leur approvisionnement en produits de première nécessité et stimuler, par la même occasion, le commerce de proximité sur l’île.  

Le projet Castor permet de fournir des matériaux de base à 500 ménages (via la même commission d’attribution) afin qu’ils puissent reconstruire leur habitat impacté par l’ouragan Irma par leurs propres moyens. Ce projet intègre également une sensibilisation aux techniques de réhabilitation.  

Le projet WASH (eau, hygiène et assainissement), mis en œuvre durant la crise, se poursuivra jusqu’à un retour à la normale du réseau d’eau. Les douze réservoirs installés à Saint-Martin restent en service, tandis que des systèmes de collecte d’eau de pluie, des citernes de stockage ou la remise en état de la plomberie sont proposés dans certains quartiers défavorisés.  

Une mission de lutte anti-vectorielle (destinée à prévenir les risques d’épidémie par le moustique notamment) est menée depuis début novembre par des jeunes de Saint-Martin engagés en Service civique, au côté de l’Agence régionale de santé (ARS).  

Un outil de sensibilisation aux risques majeurs est envisagé à destination des enfants de Saint-Martin (et Saint-Barthélemy) dans le cadre des formations de prévention et de réduction des risques proposées par la Croix-Rouge française. Ce programme pourrait par la suite être étendu à l’ensemble de la zone Antilles.  

Le pré-positionnement de stocks sur Saint-Martin s’avère pertinent, pour limiter les contraintes d’acheminement de matériel sur l’île en cas d’urgence. 

2. RENFORCER NOTRE PRÉSENCE SUR LE TERRITOIRE

Mobilisée durant la crise auprès des renforts nationaux, la délégation territoriale de Saint-Martin a tenu à reprendre rapidement ses activités traditionnelles, dans la mesure du possible, telles que l’aide alimentaire. Côté établissements, le Bus Santé pour Tous et l’équipe mobile d’intervention sociale ont repris leurs maraudes et tournées sur l’île dès le 20 octobre.

Lors de son déplacement à Saint-Martin, en novembre dernier, le président Eledjam a signé une convention de partenariat avec l’association Les Liaisons Dangereuses pour renforcer les activités médicales. Les dispositifs sociaux, médico-sociaux et sanitaires étaient déjà insuffisants sur Saint-Martin, avant le passage d’Irma. Les programmes de reconstruction doivent donc prendre en considération ces besoins spécifiques. C’est ainsi, par exemple, qu’un Centre d'Accueil et d'Accompagnement à la Réduction des risques pour Usagers de Drogues (CAARUD) mobile va être expérimenté courant décembre, afin de prendre en charge les personnes souffrant d’addiction, avec le soutien de l’ARS.

Et puis, pour relancer et structurer davantage les activités de la délégation territoriale, le Professeur Jean-Jacques Eledjam a annoncé l’ouverture prochaine d’une **Maison Croix-Rouge**. Elle rassemblera sur un même lieu bénévoles et salariés, à travers ses activités sociales, médico-sociales, de secourisme et logistiques (Plateforme d’intervention régionale pour la zone Amérique-Caraïbes –PIRAC).",268,"French"
2361484,"Partenariats pour les enfants: Programme de Coopération de l'UNICEF et du Gouvernement de Djibouti 2018-2022 Djibouti est un pays en mutation rapide. La reprise actuelle du développement économique et social offre une fenêtre d’opportunité pour améliorer durablement la vie des enfants et des femmes à Djibouti. Dans ce contexte, l’UNICEF et le Gouvernement de Djibouti entament un nouveau programme de coopération couvrant la période 2018-2022 et s’engagent en collaboration avec les autres partenaires dans l’amélioration de la vie des enfants et des femmes.

Le programme de pays s’aligne au plan de développement à long terme du pays, Djibouti Vision 2035, et aux objectifs de la SCAPE pour la période 2015-2019. Il s’inspire des objectifs de développement durable, et porte une attention toute particulière à l’équité, à l’égalité des sexes et à la résilience. Le programme de pays contribuera aux résultats du Plan-cadre des Nations Unies pour l’aide au développement (UNDAF) pour la période 2018-2022.

L’objectif global du programme consiste à veiller à ce que les droits des enfants à la survie, au développement et à la protection soient réalisés grâce à l’accès à des services sociaux de qualité et à l’adoption de comportements sains et protecteurs.

Il portera sur trois priorités principales : (a) la réduction de la mortalité des mères et des enfants de moins de cinq ans grâce à une approche intégrée de suivi des 1 000 premiers jours de la vie de chaque enfant, depuis sa conception jusqu’à son deuxième anniversaire, laquelle reposera sur des interventions relatives à la santé, au VIH, à la nutrition et à l’eau, l’hygiène et l’assainissement ; (b) la garantie d’un accès équitable à une éducation de qualité, notamment pour les enfants défavorisés; et (c) l’atténuation des vulnérabilités des enfants par le biais de l’accès aux services de protection sociale et de l’enfance, notamment pour les victimes de violences.

Ce programme vise à garantir qu’aucun enfant ne soit laissé de côté à Djibouti et que les plus vulnérables aient les meilleures chances de mener une vie saine, de réaliser leur potentiel et de rester protégés contre les dangers et la violence. Nous invitons tous les partenaires et donateurs à se joindre à nous pour accélérer les efforts pour “un monde digne des enfants”.

Ce n’est qu’en travaillant ensemble, côte à côte, que nous pourrons réaliser une chance équitable pour chaque enfant.",268,"French"

Fruit d’un travail de collaboration entre le Gouvernement et l’UNICEF, ce nouveau programme attache une attention particulière aux enfants et aux communautés les plus désavantagés et les plus vulnérables.

""D’importants progrès ont été réalisés au cours des dernières années à Djibouti. La mortalité des enfants de moins de cinq ans a été réduite de moitié au cours de la dernière décennie. Djibouti est l’un des rares pays ayant atteint l’objectif du millénaire sur l’accès à l’eau potable. Certes, un certain nombre de défis restent, mais ce programme nous permettra d’accélérer les efforts pour les adresser"" a déclaré Mohamed Ali Hassan, Secrétaire Général du Ministère des Affaires Etrangères et de la Coopération Internationale à cette occasion.

Le nouveau programme a pour vision de réaliser les droits des enfants à la survie, au développement et à la protection grâce à l’accès à des services sociaux de qualité et à l’adoption de comportements sains et protecteurs. Il s’articulera autour de (i) la survie et du développement de l’enfant, (ii) de l’éducation et du développement des adolescents et (iii) de la protection de l’enfant et de l’inclusion sociale. 

""L’UNICEF s’engage à renforcer son appui à Djibouti, sur la base des priorités définies par le Gouvernement et tenant compte du cadre de programmation du Système des Nations Unies récemment approuvé par le Gouvernement"" a pour sa part déclaré Djanabou Mahondé, Représentante de l’UNICEF à Djibouti. 

Il s’agira essentiellement d’offrir un paquet d’interventions à haut impact sur la survie et le développement de l’enfant, avec un focus sur les 1.000 premiers jours de la vie de l’enfant ; d’élargir les opportunités d’apprentissage formel et non formel pour les enfants et les adolescents et enfin de s’assurer que les enfants vulnérables et les adolescents ont accès à des services intégrés de protection de l’enfance et de protection sociale. Ces interventions intègreront des composantes liées au développement de la petite enfance, à la programmation sur les adolescents et au changement social et de comportement.

""L’UNICEF continuera en amont à concentrer ses efforts pour appuyer le Gouvernement à créer un environnement politique national et législatif favorisant les droits des enfants, et en aval à prioriser les zones géographiques où les populations les plus vulnérables et désavantagées sont moins bien desservies par les services sociaux essentiels"" a poursuivi Mahondé. 

Le flux actuel de migrants et de réfugiés en raison des événements qui se produisent dans la région ainsi que l’impact du changement climatique – avec une sécheresse qui sévit dans le pays depuis une décennie - seront également adressés de manière spécifique dans ce programme. 

Le nouveau programme couvre une période de cinq ans (2018-2022) et environ $25 millions de dollars américains sont requis pour sa mise en œuvre. ""L’UNICEF appelle à la solidarité de tous pour l’aider à mobiliser ces ressources afin de s’assurer qu’aucun enfant ne soit laissé de côté à Djibouti"" a conclu Mahondé.

2361419,"Le RSSG aux volontaires de l’ONU en RCA: « Ce que vous faites est l’essence de ce que nous devons être » Ils sont plus de 300 volontaires des Nations Unies et plus d’un millier d’autres, membres d’organisations non gouvernementales à mettre à contribution leurs compétences et expériences en faveur de la stabilisation et du relèvement de la Centrafrique, dans des domaines aussi nombreux que variés, qu’il s’agisse de l’administration, de la logistique, de l’humanitaire, des droits de l’homme, de la protection des enfants, des affaires politiques, de la communication, des affaires civiles que de l’assainissement.

Ce mardi 5 décembre 2017, journée retenue par l’ONU pour les célébrer chaque année, les Volontaires de la Centrafrique se sont réunis, au stade Omnisports de Bangui, pour marquer symboliquement l’évènement. Une cérémonie riche en couleurs qui a été rehaussée de la présence du Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies et chef de la MINUSCA, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, de la Représentante spéciale adjointe, Coordonnatrice humanitaire et Représentante résidente du PNUD, Najat Rochdi, et du représentant du ministre centrafricain de la Jeunesse, l’inspecteur central Gilbert Bingui, entre autres personnalités qui ont répondu à l’invitation du chef du programme des Volontaires des Nations Unies, Davy Moundongo.

L’occasion était bien propice pour lever le voile sur un apport combien déterminant dans un contexte centrafricain marqué, à bien des égards, par des périodes d’instabilité qui,  souvent, propulse les volontaires aux premières lignes de la réponse. Ce que l’inspecteur central Bingui a tenu à saluer ce jour : « Grâce à leur soutien continu, les volontaires apportent aux personnes et aux communautés l’appui dont elles ont besoin pour se reconstruire et mieux se préparer à affronter un avenir incertain », a-t-il dit à leur égard.

« La Journée internationale des Volontaires permet également de mieux faire connaître vos actions, vos interventions multiformes ainsi que le rôle que vous jouez face aux nombreux défis, et ce dans un contexte où l’insécurité rend encore plus difficile le travail de chacun d’entre nous », a, pour sa part, fait valoir Parfait Onanga-Anyanga. 

Saluant vivement la contribution des Volontaires des Nations Unies dans l’opérationnalisation de la Cour pénale spéciale (CPS), il a qualifié celle-ci de « non négligeable depuis l’été 2017, avec notamment des activités de sensibilisation des communautés sur cette importante institution, essentielle dans la lutte contre l’impunité en République centrafricaine. » Et le chef de la MINUSCA d’ajouter : « Ce que vous faites est véritablement l’essence de ce que nous devons être : une première aide, une parole, un sourire, un acteur de solidarité »

Outre les prestations artistiques qui ont émaillé la cérémonie officielle, une exposition de photos a permis aux invités d’apprécier un échantillon d’activités professionnelles et des initiatives extra-professionnelles qui sont l’œuvre de volontaires en  RCA. Des projets tels la « case de lecture » pour des jeunes du huitième arrondissement de Bangui dont la réalisation est en cours, avec le soutien du Représentant spécial des Nations Unies.

2361204,"Détermination du panier Minimum de dépense de Ménage dans la Région de L’Extrême-Nord Cameroon **Contexte et justification**

Le Cameroun est considéré comme l’un des pays pauvres de la planète. Il est classé 153e sur 187 pays selon l'indice de développement humain 2015 avec un PIB de 2.803 USD par habitant. 39% de la population de 23,5 millions habitants du pays vit encore en dessous du seuil de la pauvreté . Confronté à une triple crise humanitaire liée aux conflits armés en République centrafricaine et au nord-est du Nigéria ainsi qu’à une vulnérabilité chronique entrainant des niveaux élevés d’insécurité alimentaire et de malnutrition, le Cameroun a vu son nombre de réfugiés et de personnes déplacées internes accroître depuis 2015, générant une augmentation brusque des besoins humanitaires tant pour les personnes déplacées que pour les communautés hôtes déjà vulnérables avant la crise.  
Cette situation a rendu les conditions de vie des populations plus précaires dans la partie septentrionale et à l’Est du pays où la pauvreté était déjà considère comme presque endémique. 

La crise du bassin du Lac Tchad est directement liée à l’insurrection armée lancée par le Groupe Boko Haram (BH) depuis le Nigéria. En 2014, la situation sécuritaire dans les régions du Nord du Nigeria s’est fortement dégradée et s’est propagée dans toute la région du Bassin du Lac Tchad notamment au Niger, Cameroun et Tchad, conduisant à des déplacements de population massifs au Nigeria, Niger, Cameroun et Tchad, et entre le Nigéria et les pays voisins. À ce jour, les raids transfrontaliers de Boko Haram, les attentats-suicides et l’insécurité accrue ont causé des déplacements massifs et amplifié la vulnérabilité de la population locale de cette région aride du Sahel régulièrement affectée par la sécheresse, des pénuries alimentaires et des épidémies.

De par sa position géographique, la Région de l’Extrême-Nord du Cameroun constitue un carrefour peu stable dans le Bassin du Lac Tchad. Cette partie est confrontée à une situation d’urgence humanitaire complexe où 10,9 millions de personnes ont maintenant besoin d’aide humanitaire d’urgence repartie dans le nord-est du Nigeria, la région de l’Extrême-Nord du Cameroun, l’ouest du Tchad et le sud-ouest du Niger. 

La situation d’insécurité accrue cause des déplacements massifs et amplifié la vulnérabilité des populations locales dans la région. Au Cameroun 1,6 M de personnes sont dans le besoin d’assistance et dont 1,5 M se trouve particulièrement dans la Région de l’Extrême-Nord . La situation sécuritaire dans la Région de l’Extrême-Nord du Cameroun reste toujours volatile marquée par des raids transfrontaliers, les attentats-suicides et l’incursion de Boko Haram. 

La Région accueille actuellement 237 967 PDI (soit 40 051 ménages), 29 728 réfugiés non-enregistrés (soit 4 711 ménages) et 61 090 retournés (soit 9 736 ménages) . Le nombre de personnes déplacées internes a augmenté de 23 % depuis le début de l’année et atteint environ 325 589 personnes à la fin août 2017 . Audelà de la crise actuelle, la région de l’Extrême-Nord présente le taux de pauvreté le plus élevé au Cameroun (74,3%) et est en nette augmentation de plus de 5 points par rapport à 2007.

En réponse à la crise humanitaire dynamique, complexe et aggravante, la communautaire humanitaires met en place des interventions visant à fournir de l’assistance aux personnes affectées. Ces activités sont conçues pour répondre aux besoins fondamentaux des populations les plus affectées afin de limiter leurs recourt à des stratégies d’adaptation négatives, d'améliorer l'accès aux aliments et de préserver, restaurer et diversifier les moyens de subsistance.  

En fonction des objectifs programmatiques et pour des raisons contextuelles, diverses modalités d’assistance sont utilisées par les acteurs humanitaires à savoir l’assistance en nature, l’assistance par le bon d’achat et l’assistance en espèce.  

Au vu de la flexibilité qu’offre la modalité de transferts monétaires à apporter une réponse aux besoins fondamentaux et / ou pour protéger, initier ou restaurer des moyens de subsistance ou des activités économiques pendant ou après une crise humanitaire, les acteurs humanitaires portent de plus en plus une attention particulière à cette modalité.  

De ce fait, considérant le nombre important d’acteurs qui mettent déjà en œuvre ou envisagent intervenir à travers les transferts monétaires dans la Région de l’Extrême-Nord, un Groupe de Travail Cash a été formellement mis en place à Maroua avec l’appui de CALP en Mars 2017. CaLP a organisé une session de renforcement des capacités des acteurs sur l’approche cash à Maroua. Il s’agit d’une plate-forme régionale de soutien aux Groupes Intersectoriels pour la coordination, le partage de l'information, l'apprentissage, le plaidoyer et le soutien à l'évaluation des programmes, l’appui à la conception et la mise en œuvre des programmes de transferts monétaires dans la région de l’Extrême Nord.  

En effet, il est apparu que la coordination des acteurs de transferts monétaires était particulièrement difficile à assurer, engendrant et accentuant parfois les difficultés opérationnelles liées à l’absence de collaboration et d’harmonisation des interventions entre acteurs.  

L’inexistence d’une plateforme pour l’harmonisation et le partage d’informations précises et cohérentes sur la faisabilité des TM (marchés, prestataires de services etc) et l’absence d’outil consensuel pourrait expliquer en partie les gaps que l’on perçoit encore sur la préparation des acteurs à mettre en place une réponse adéquate dans un tel contexte.  

Dans l’optique d’apporter un début de réponse à cette problématique, le Groupe de Travail Cash s’est fixée pour objectif de mener une évaluation pour déterminer le panier de dépenses minimum (MEB) dans la Région de l’Extrême-Nord. À cet effet, un groupe technique restreint de travail (Task force) constitué des organisations justifiant d’une capacité technique a été mis en place pour piloter le processus, gérer la dynamique et partager les informations avec tous les membres. Ainsi, le PAM, l’IRC, le CRS, l’UNICEF, le CODAS CARITAS, le CARE et le HCR se sont engagés à faire partie comme membres. Cette cohorte sera rejointe par l’OMS, PUI et FAO.  

La portée de cette évaluation vise à élaborer une cartographie des besoins multisectoriels des ménages affectés par la crise. Il s’agit de répertorier ce que requiert les ménages pour répondre à leurs besoins de base, que ce soit en permanence ou à titre saisonnier et leur coût moyen sur la durée. De ce fait, les besoins de base ici constituent les biens ou les services indispensables pour la survie des ménages / des individus et la protection leurs moyens de subsistance afin de répondre à leurs besoins essentiels.  

Cette évaluation des besoins multisectoriels des ménages affectés par la crise couvre la région ExtrêmeNord, avec un accent particulier sur les départements les plus affectés (Diamare, Mayo Tsanaga, Mayo Sava, et Logone-et-Chari). Il est orienté suivant le résultat du DTM 9. La portée de l'évaluation permettra de ressortir une carte des besoins par secteur afin de préparer une réponse adéquate. Cela constituera également un outil d’aide à la contextualisation du mode d'assistance humanitaire.  

Suivant le protocole défini dans la feuille de route, ceci constitue une évaluation multisectorielle qui requiert un pool d’expertise varié et diversifié. C’est dans cette logique que s’est inscrite la forte mobilisation de la communauté humanitaire pour mener cette enquête dont les ressources résulteront de la volonté et l’intérêt que chacune portera à cette dynamisme.",268,"French"
2361134,"Promouvoir la gestion de l’eau et de l’environnement en milieu scolaire ACTU – Organisation d’une exposition photographique sur l’eau et l’environnement à Bukavu par UNICEF, en collaboration avec l’Institut Français et la Coopération Suisse.

**L’eau au cœur de la science**  
Cette exposition est l’occasion d’organiser des séances de lavage correct des mains. Au milieu du groupe d’élèves, Rehema, 18 ans, est toute souriante.
« Je me lave toujours les mains avant de manger ou après avoir été aux toilettes. Mais aujourd’hui, je me rends compte qu’en réalité, je ne me lavais pas correctement les mains » a-t-elle avoué à la fin d’une visite guidée effectuée avec ses camarades au lycée Cirezi de Bukavu (Sud-Kivu).

A l’instar de Rehema, ce sont environ 150 élèves des collèges et lycées de Bukavu qui sont reçus chaque jour dans une grande pièce abritant l’exposition itinérante axée sur le thème: « l’eau au cœur de la science ».

« Nous avons choisi ce thème pour attirer l’attention des enfants, futurs cadres de ce pays, sur la nécessité de préserver l’environnement et les ressources en eau » a précisé Arsene Azandossessi, chef de bureau provincial de l’UNICEF au Sud Kivu. « Nous voulons susciter le goût de la science en milieu scolaire et surtout emmener les élèves et les enseignants à prendre conscience de leur environnement actuel et à se préparer à agir individuellement et collectivement face aux problèmes d’eau, d’hygiène et d’assainissement dans leurs milieux de vie ».

Répartis en petits groupes de 5 à 6 personnes, les élèves scrutent les tableaux géants et les dessins animés conçus pour l’occasion. Tout au long de la visite, les animateurs expliquent aux élèves le cycle de l’eau, le rapport entre l’eau, l’hygiène et l’assainissement et surtout la place de l’eau dans les objectifs de développement durable (ODD).

**Former des ambassadeurs du lavage correct des mains**  
Pour Balola Medard, directeur de l’Institut Nyalungeba de Bukavu, où étudie la jeune Rehema, cette exposition-photo est arrivée à point nommé !

« Notre Province fait face à une grande épidémie de choléra qui a déjà fait de nombreuses victimes. Nous devons former les enfants pour qu’ils deviennent des ambassadeurs du lavage correct des mains et de l’utilisation responsable de l’eau dans leurs écoles et leurs communautés respectives »

**Diffuser les normes d’hygiène et d’assainissement**  
Organisée en partenariat avec le ministère de l’Education nationale Congolais et le Bureau de l’hygiène de la Division Provinciale de la Santé Prévue, l’exposition itinérante est prévue dans six différents sites et a pour objectif de sensibiliser 22.000 élèves et 5.000 enseignants sur les normes d’hygiène et d’assainissement dans les écoles et les communautés.

L’exposition s’inscrit dans le cadre du programme national « Ecoles et Villages Assainis », visant à améliorer les conditions d’accès à l’eau, l’hygiène et l’assainissement en milieu scolaire et ainsi contribuer à réduire les taux de morbidité et de mortalité diarrhéique tout en améliorant la fréquentation scolaire.

« Je crois que les règles d’hygiène vont changer ce soir à la maison. Je m’engage aussi à sensibiliser chaque jour, 5 camarades de classe sur la gestion efficace de l’eau » a déclaré Nehema à la fin de la visite, l’air contente.

Hillary Margolis  
Chercheuse, division Droits des femmes

En 2015, alors que les conflits faisaient rage en [République centrafricaine](https://www.hrw.org/fr/africa/central-african-republic), Évelyne (ce n’est pas son vrai nom) rentrait chez elle après avoir vendu des feuilles de manioc, près de Boda, dans le Sud-Est du pays, lorsqu’un combattant anti-balaka l’a jetée par terre et l’a violée avant de la laisser en train de saigner. Elle avait environ 14 ans.

Deux mois après le viol, Évelyne s’est rendu compte qu’elle était enceinte. Rendue orpheline par le conflit, elle a vendu des feuilles de manioc pour gagner de quoi se préparer à l’arrivée du bébé, mais ce qu’elle désirait par-dessus tout, c’était étudier. « J’étais très en colère car je ne pouvais pas aller à l’école », a-t-elle déclaré. « Ma tante a refusé. Elle a dit que je devais d’abord accoucher. »

[Les civils continuent à être les premiers touchés par la guerre](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2017/10/27/republique-centrafricaine-les-civils-pris-pour-cible-dans-une-nouvelle-flambee-de) déclenchée fin 2012 lorsque les rebelles de la Seleka, en majorité musulmans, ont lancé une campagne de violence et de terreur pour s’emparer du pouvoir, ce qui a abouti à des attaques de représailles par les groupes armés « anti-balaka » qui s’étaient constitués contre les premiers. Les deux camps se sont mis à pratiquer [la violence et l’esclavage sexuels systématiques et à grande échelle](https://reliefweb.int/node/2255499) en tant qu’armes de guerre.

Pour Évelyne et les autres filles que j’ai interrogées en République centrafricaine, le viol n’a pas eu seulement de profondes répercussions physiques et émotionnelles, il a également interrompu leur scolarité. La campagne de 16 jours pour agir contre les violences liées au genre exhorte les communautés à [« ne laisser personne de côté (Leave No One Behind) »](http://www.unwomen.org/fr/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action/16-days-of-activism). C’est un bon moyen de nous rappeler que la perte d’accès à l’éducation est une des conséquences les plus dévastatrices pour les filles victimes de violence sexuelle.

Certaines filles ne retournent jamais à l’école après le viol à cause de [la stigmatisation et de l’humiliation](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2016/06/19/republique-centrafricaine-violees-et-abandonnees-quand-les-conflits-font-rage). D’autres ont déclaré soit qu’elles avaient trop peur de revenir, soit que des membres de leur famille, craignant pour leur sécurité, leur avaient interdit, surtout dans les cas où les violences sexuelles avaient été commises sur le chemin entre la maison et l’école.

Souvent les rescapées de la violence sexuelle qui retournent à l’école ne sont pas assez soutenues pour poursuivre leur scolarité. Ainsi Évelyne a fini par retourner en classe, mais sans proches pour s’occuper du bébé, c’est très difficile pour elle. « Je ne suis pas tranquille », a-t-elle déclaré, « quand je vais à l’école, je pense encore au bébé qui est à la maison. »

Il faut que les gouvernements, les donateurs et les organismes fournissant de l’aide [s’engagent à améliorer l’accès à l’éducation](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2017/06/16/afrique-permettre-toutes-les-filles-dacceder-leducation) pour que les filles qui subissent des violences sexuelles et d’autres violences liées au genre dans le cadre de conflits ne soient pas victimes une seconde fois. Ils devraient favoriser le retour des filles à l’école, en les aidant sur le plan médical, psychosocial et socioéconomique, et lutter contre la stigmatisation des rescapées de viol et des [élèves enceintes](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/15/tanzania-policy-kicking-pregnant-girls-out-school-shameful) grâce à des programmes d’éducation communautaire.

On trouvera ci-après le texte de la déclaration à la presse faite, aujourd’hui, par le Président du Conseil de sécurité pour le mois de décembre, M. Koro Bessho (Japon):

Les membres du Conseil de sécurité ont condamné dans les termes les plus vifs l’attaque contre un détachement de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République centrafricaine qui protégeait un camp de déplacés à Bria, perpétrée le 4 décembre 2017 par des individus soupçonnés d’être des éléments antibalaka, au cours de laquelle un casque bleu mauritanien a été tué et deux autres blessés, ainsi qu’un casque bleu zambien.

Les membres du Conseil ont adressé leurs plus sincères condoléances et exprimé toute leur sympathie à la famille du casque bleu tué, et ont exprimé toute leur sympathie aux familles des casques bleus blessés, ainsi qu’à la Mauritanie, à la Zambie et à la MINUSCA.  Ils ont souhaité aux blessés un prompt rétablissement.

Les membres du Conseil ont condamné dans les termes les plus énergiques toutes les attaques, provocations et incitations à la violence visant la MINUSCA qui sont notamment le fait de groupes armés.

Les membres du Conseil ont réitéré que les attaques visant des casques bleus peuvent constituer des crimes de guerre et ont rappelé à toutes les parties leurs obligations au regard du droit international humanitaire.  Ils ont demandé au Gouvernement centrafricain d’ouvrir rapidement une enquête sur cette attaque et d’en traduire les auteurs en justice.

Les membres du Conseil ont réaffirmé leur soutien sans réserve à la MINUSCA et ont exprimé leur profonde gratitude aux pays fournisseurs de contingents et de personnel de police.

Les membres du Conseil ont réaffirmé leur plein appui au Représentant spécial du Secrétaire général pour la République centrafricaine, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, et à la MINUSCA, qui concourent à l’action menée par les autorités et le peuple centrafricains pour installer durablement la paix et la stabilité dans leur pays, comme l’a demandé le Conseil de sécurité dans sa résolution 2387 (2017).

2360884,"Lancement de la carte la plus complète au monde sur les stocks de carbone dans le sol **Il est essentiel de protéger et d’augmenter les stocks de carbone du sol afin d’améliorer la production alimentaire et d’atténuer le changement climatique, selon la FAO**

5 décembre 2017, Rome - A  l' occasion de la [Journée mondiale des sols](http://www.fao.org/world-soil-day/fr/), la FAO a lancé la [carte mondiale](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i8195e.pdf) la plus complète à ce jour montrant la quantité de stocks de carbone présents dans le sol.

La matière organique du sol et le carbone, en tant que son principal composant, sont essentiels pour la santé et la fertilité des sols, pour une bonne infiltration et rétention de l'eau, ainsi que pour la production alimentaire. Permettant de stocker du carbone, la conservation et  la restauration des sols est importante pour parvenir à une agriculture durable et atténuer le changement climatique.

Les sols mondiaux constituent le plus grand puits de carbone au monde permettant de réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère. Intensifier son rôle pourrait fortement compenser l'augmentation de dioxyde de carbone présent dans l'atmosphère. La dernière Conférence sur le changement climatique à Bonn (COP23) a reconnu la nécessité d'améliorer le carbone du sol, la sante du sol et la fertilité du sol.

La Carte mondiale du carbone organique du sol montre les stocks de carbone organique présents dans les 30 premiers centimètres du sol et apporte des informations sur où trouver des régions naturelles contenant des stocks de carbone susceptibles d'être conservés, ainsi que les régions où le phénomène de séquestration du carbone pourrait être davantage exploité. Ces informations aident à prendre des décisions destinées à préserver ou à augmenter les stocks actuels de carbone dans le sol, contribuant ainsi à la lutte contre le changement climatique.

«Le sol est la base de l'agriculture, c'est de là que vient la nourriture», a déclaré Mme Maria Helena Semedo, Directrice générale adjointe de la FAO, lors de la cérémonie de lancement de la Journée mondiale des sols, qui s'est tenue aujourd'hui au siège de la FAO, à Rome. «Maintenir les fonctions du sol et les services écosystémiques importants qu'ils rendent en contribuant notamment à la production alimentaire et en améliorant la résilience face au changement climatique requiert des pratiques de gestion des sols durables», a-t-elle ajouté.

**Gérer les sols pour protéger les sols riches en carbone et restaurer les sols dégradés**

Selon la carte, le sol contient près de 680 milliards de tonnes de carbone dans ses premiers 30 centimètres - soit le double de ce qui est présent dans notre atmosphère. Il s'agit d'une quantité importante par rapport au carbone stocké dans l'ensemble de la végétation (560 milliards de tonnes).

On trouve plus de 60% de ces 680 milliards de tonnes de carbone dans dix pays à travers le monde (Russie, Canada, Etats-Unis, Chine, Brésil, Indonésie, Australie, Argentine, Kazakhstan, République démocratique du Congo). Cela signifie que des mesures devront être prises en vue de protéger ces sols naturellement riches en carbone et d'éviter la libération d'émissions de gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère.

La dégradation d'un tiers des sols mondiaux a déjà entraîné la libération d'une énorme quantité de carbone dans l'atmosphère. Restaurer ces sols peut permettre de retirer jusqu'à 63 milliards de tonnes de carbone de l'atmosphère, contribuant ainsi à réduire les effets du changement climatique.

**Augmenter la teneur en carbone des sols pour augmenter les rendements**

Les sols à forte teneur en carbone organique seront généralement plus productifs, plus à même de purifier l'eau et de fournir aux plantes de meilleures conditions en termes d'humidité. L'eau stockée dans le sol sert de source pour 90 pour cent de la production agricole mondiale et représente près de 65 pour cent de l'eau douce.

Augmenter la teneur en carbone organique dans le sol, en améliorant notamment sa gestion, peut aider à maintenir la productivité lors de conditions climatiques plus sèches. Des mesures devraient donc être prises pour encourager la séquestration du carbone lorsque les conditions le permettent. Des pratiques innovantes, telles que le recours à des espèces d'arbustes à racines profondes, devraient également être encouragées.

« Maintenir mais surtout augmenter les stocks de carbone dans le sol devrait devenir obligatoire car cela nous permettra d'exploiter au mieux le potentiel du sol et de contribuer aux efforts visant à s'adapter au changement climatique et à en atténuer les effets, » a indiqué Mme Semedo.

**Un procédé participatif**

Cette première carte du carbone organique du sol développée à travers un procédé inclusif à l'initiative des pays a été soutenu par le [Groupe technique intergouvernemental de la FAO sur les sols](http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/intergovernmental-technical-panel-soils/fr/). Dernièrement, plus de 90 pays membres ont partagé leurs cartes nationales indiquant leurs stocks de carbone. Le travail de la FAO a ensuite consisté à en faire une seule carte mondiale. Il s'agit d'un pas  concret vers la réalisation de l'[Objectif de développement durable numéro 15](http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/goals/goal-15/fr/) -  La vie sur Terre. Pour ces pays, la prochaine étape sera de surveiller les niveaux de carbone organique dans leurs sols, en utilisant leurs systèmes nationaux d'information sur les sols, et de décider de la meilleure manière de les gérer, tout en contrôlant l'impact de ces mesures.

**Le Prix Glinka World Soil décerné pour la deuxième fois**

Au cours de la cérémonie, le Prix Glinka World Soil 2017 a été décerné à l'Association argentine des producteurs de cultures sans labours (AAPRESID) pour leurs efforts visant à promouvoir des pratiques de gestion durable des sols en luttant notamment contre l'érosion des sols, contribuant ainsi directement à la sécurité alimentaire en Amérique du Sud et dans le monde.

Le Prix Glinka World Soil, qui tire son nom du scientifique russe Konstantin D. Glinka, a été créé en 2016 par le [Partenariat mondial sur les sols](http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/fr/), avec le soutien de la Russie. Il rend hommage aux individus et organisations dont les activités ont contribué à promouvoir une gestion durable des sols et à protéger les ressources du sol.

Faits et chiffres sur les sols

• Grâce à une gestion durable des sols, nous pourrions produire jusqu'à 58% de nourriture en plus. La préservation des sols est essentielle afin de réaliser l'objectif Faim Zéro à travers le monde. 95% de la nourriture est produite à partir de nos sols.

• Dans le monde entier, près de 80% de la consommation calorique moyenne de chaque personne trouve son origine dans les cultures directement cultivées dans les sols.

• Cela peut prendre jusqu' à 1000 ans pour former 1cm de sol. 

• Les sols peuvent séquestrer près de 20 000 mégatonnes de carbone en l'espace de 25 ans, soit 10% de plus que les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.

• Le sol filtre les dépôts, les pesticides, les nutriments des plantes, le sel, les bactéries, les virus, les métaux lourds et les produits chimiques organiques des ressources d'eau douce.

• Il y a plus d'organismes vivant dans une cuillerée de sol que de personnes sur Terre.

• La majorité des antibiotiques connus trouvent leur origine dans les bactéries du sol, y compris la pénicilline.",268,"French"
2360879,"Afrique de l'Ouest et Afrique centrale : 4 enfants sur 5 vivant avec le VIH ne reçoivent pas de traitement, selon l'UNICEF 5 décembre 2017 – Plus de quatre décennies après le début de l'épidémie de VIH/sida, quatre enfants sur cinq vivant avec le VIH en Afrique de l'Ouest et en Afrique centrale ne reçoivent toujours pas de traitement antirétroviral et les décès liés au sida chez les adolescents âgés de 15 à 19 ans sont en hausse, selon un nouveau rapport publié mardi par les Nations Unies.

Tout en reconnaissant les progrès accomplis dans plusieurs domaines, le rapport intitulé 'Vers une vie sans sida en Afrique de l'Ouest et Afrique centrale' et publié conjointement par l'UNICEF et l'ONUSIDA, montre que l'Afrique de l'Ouest et l'Afrique centrale sont à la traîne en matière de prévention, de traitement du VIH et de soins pour les enfants et les adolescents. En 2016, environ 60.000 enfants ont été nouvellement infectés par le VIH dans cette région.

« Il est tragique que tant d'enfants et d'adolescents ne reçoivent pas les traitements dont ils ont besoin, simplement parce qu'ils n'ont pas été testés », a déclaré Marie-Pierre Poirier, Directrice régionale de l'UNICEF pour l'Afrique de l'Ouest et l'Afrique centrale. « Nous devons mieux utiliser les innovations pour améliorer le diagnostic précoce et améliorer l'accès au traitement du VIH et aux soins pour les enfants ».

La couverture par la région des thérapies antirétrovirales chez les enfants vivant avec le VIH est la plus faible au monde car de nombreux pays ont une capacité limitée à effectuer les tests nécessaires au diagnostic précoce du VIH chez les nourrissons. Sans connaître le statut VIH d'un enfant, sa famille est moins susceptible de rechercher le traitement qui pourrait prévenir la mort d'un enfant à cause de maladies liées au sida.

La situation est pire chez les adolescents. Le nombre annuel de nouvelles infections par le VIH chez les 15-19 ans dans la région dépasse maintenant celui des enfants âgés de 0 à 14 ans. Ces nouvelles infections se produisent principalement par contact sexuel non protégé et chez les adolescentes.

Tout aussi préoccupant, selon le rapport, c'est que l'Afrique de l'Ouest et l'Afrique centrale ont enregistré une augmentation de 35% du nombre annuel de décès liés au sida parmi les adolescents âgés de 15 à 19 ans - le seul groupe d'âge où les décès ont augmenté entre 2010 et 2016.

Alors que la population des jeunes de la région devrait augmenter considérablement au cours des prochaines décennies, notamment dans des pays comme la République démocratique du Congo et le Nigéria, le nombre d'enfants et d'adolescents étant infectés par le VIH et mourant du sida restera élevé si la réponse au VIH, à la fois la prévention et le traitement, ne s'améliore pas considérablement.

Le rapport souligne que les 24 pays qui composent la région de l'Afrique de l'Ouest et de l'Afrique centrale abritent 25% des enfants âgés de 0 à 14 ans vivant avec le VIH dans le monde.

« Les dirigeants de la région ont approuvé un plan de rattrapage visant à tripler le nombre de personnes sous traitement dans la région - y compris les enfants - d'ici à la fin 2018. Le problème clé est maintenant d'accélérer la mise en œuvre », a déclaré Luiz Loures, Directeur adjoint de l'ONUSIDA. « Les pays devraient d'urgence mettre en place des stratégies plus efficaces pour le diagnostic précoce du VIH chez les nourrissons, et commencer à réduire les inégalités dans l'accès des enfants au traitement ».",268,"French"
2360634,"Togo : UNHCR Flash Info : Forum National sur la recherche des solutions durables à la situation des réfugiés vivant au Togo Du 13 au 15 Novembre 2017, s’est tenu à l’hôtel concorde à Lomé, un forum national sur la recherche des solutions durables aux réfugiés vivant au Togo.  

Organisé par le gouvernement togolais, ce forum a reçu l’appui technique et financier du HCR Togo. Il a connu la participation active du HCR Togo, de plusieurs ministères, des agences du Systèmes des Nations Unies au Togo, des organisations de la société civile, des représentations diplomatiques et consulaires accréditées au Togo, de l’Ambassade de la Côte d’Ivoire au Ghana et d’une quinzaine de responsables de communautés et représentants de tous les groupes de réfugiés.  

Le HCR Bénin et de la Coordination Nationale béninoise d’Assistance aux Réfugiés, ont également participé à ce forum au cours duquel, ils ont partagé avec le Togo, les expériences de leur pays sur l’intégration locale des réfugiés.  

L’objectif du forum a été d’approfondir les réflexions sur les solutions durables objectivement réalisables par le Togo et définir les stratégies qui améliorent l’accès des réfugiés à ces solutions.  

C’est la Ministre de l’Action Sociale, de la Promotion de la Femme et de l’Alphabétisation, Mme Tchabinandi Kolani Yentcharé qui a ouvert les travaux de ce forum avec à ses côtés, la Représentante du HCR au Togo, Mme Mariam Diallo, le Conseiller du Ministre de la Sécurité et de la Protection Civile, le Colonel Baragou Bamana, représentant son Ministre. Elle a réaffirmé solennellement l’engagement du gouvernement à continuer de créer les conditions d’un asile agréable à tous les réfugiés au Togo.
  
Dans son message, la Représentante du HCR Togo, a fait le point de la mise en œuvre des solutions durables et exprimé ses remerciements au gouvernement togolais. Elle s’est réjouie des efforts consentis actuellement par le Togo pour favoriser, non seulement, le rapatriement volontaire des réfugiés mais aussi leur intégration locale au plan socio-économique à travers le projet agropastoral mis en œuvre à Tandjouaré (au nord dans la région des savanes pour les réfugiés ghanéens) et à BolouKpondavé (au sud dans la région maritime pour les réfugiés urbains).  

Après trois 3 jours de travaux ponctués de débats inclusifs, francs et parfois houleux, les participants ont formulé 29 recommandations sur les 3 solutions durables (rapatriement volontaire, intégration locale et réinstallation) et élaboré un plan d’action triennal pour leur mise en œuvre.  

Ces recommandations sont principalement relatives à : 

 l’offre du rapatriement volontaire et de l’intégration locale au Togo à travers l’accès aux cartes de résidence privilégiées ou la naturalisation pour les réfugiés de longue durée ; 

 la réévaluation des dossiers/statut sur la demande des réfugiés qui en dépit du changement des circonstances dans leurs pays d’origine, ont encore une crainte fondée de persécution ; 

 l’identification et la soumission à la réinstallation, des cas qui répondent aux critères, en fonction de l’évolution des politiques des pays demandeurs.

A la clôture de ce forum, la Ministre de l’Action Sociale, de la Promotion de la Femme et de l’Alphabétisation, Mme Tchabinandi Kolani Yentcharé a réaffirmé l’engagement du gouvernement à mettre tout en œuvre pour la réalisation de ces recommandations.

La situation sécuritaire dans la région de l’Extrême-Nord du Cameroun demeure volatile et imprévisible. La semaine en revue a été calme dans l’ensemble. Toutefois, 02 camions transportant des marchandises ont été attaqués le 27 novembre sur la route nationale N1, en allant de Maroua à Kousseri. Les cas de reddition des combattants Boko Haram sont sporadiquement enregistrés dans le département du Mayo-Sava mais aucune structure officielle pour leur réintégration n’a été mise en place dans la région. Une vingtaine de ces repentis se trouvent présentement en observation à la base de la Force Mixte Multinationale à Mora. Durant la semaine du 20 novembre, une manœuvre militaire conjointe (Cameroun, Nigeria et Tchad) le long des frontières a été observée en vue d’empêcher toute offensive de Boko Haram. 

**Développements majeurs Rapatriement volontaire**

Dans le cadre de l'accord Tripartite pour le rapatriement des réfugiés nigérians vivant au Cameroun et suite à la dernière mission dans les zones d'origine au Nigeria au mois d'août 2017, des réunions et des entretiens ont eu lieu avec les réfugiés du camp de Minawao. Le but de ces concertations avec les réfugiés était de les informer du processus de rapatriement librement consenti et de communiquer les informations disponibles sur leurs régions d'origine. Il a été décidé qu'une équipe de réfugiés sera associée à la prochaine mission Triparite (en cours durant cette période en revue) dans les régions d'origine dans l'Etat d'Adamawa au Nigeria. 

Une campagne d’information de masse, opérée par la Lutherian World Federation (LWF) a également démarré, avec pour objectif d’expliquer aux populations réfugiées le principe de l’accord tripartite, ainsi que la façon dont se déroulera le retour volontaire dès que les conditions de sécurité et de dignité seront réunies pour permettre le retour des réfugiés dans leurs localités d’origine.

Dans le cadre du suivi et du reportage des activités financées par l’Agence Internationale de Coopération Coréenne (KOICA), une mission composée du représentant du bureau KOICA de deux de leurs membres ainsi que du chargé de programme HCR ont effectué les 27-30 novembre 2017, une visite de travail dans les régions de l’Est et l’Adamaoua. Cette visite s’inscrit dans le cadre de la vérification de l’évolution des projets financés par KOICA dans les domaines de l'éducation, de la santé, des moyens de subsistance, de l’eau et assainissement et de la construction des abris.

Mission ACNUR dans l’Est Une mission espagnole (España con ACNUR) s’est rendue dans la région de l’Est du Cameroun du 20-23 novembre 2017. Ce fut pour eux l’occasion d’observer les activités liées aux moyens de subsistance, à l’enregistrement biométrique, au transfert monétaire, et à l’établissement d’actes de naissances aux enfants réfugiés. Ils ont par ailleurs participé à la cérémonie de remise d’actes de naissances à 193 enfants réfugiés du site de Lolo en présence des autorités administratives. Il s’agissait de leur troisième mission pour le compte de l’année 2017.  

**Don de l’ambassade d’Israel en médicaments pour les réfugiés centrafricains dans la région de l’Est** 

Le 27 novembre, S.E.M. Ran Gidor, ambassadeur d’Israel au Cameroun, a remis au Représentant du HCR et au partenaire Africa Humanitarian Action (AHA) un important don de médicaments et fournitures médicales pour l’est du pays.  

**Don de l’ambassade de Chine en non-vivres aux populations réfugiés, personnes déplacées internes et communauté hôte.**

Le 24 Novembre, S.E.M. Wei Wenhua, ambassadeur de la République Populaire de Chine au Cameroun et le Représentant du HCR ont effectué une visite dans la région de l’Extrême Nord. Elle a été marquée par une descente au camp des réfugiés de Minawao où un important don constitué de nattes ; récipients ; vêtements ; chaussures a été offert aux populations réfugiés, aux IDPs, et à la communauté hôte. Ce geste fort visait notamment à montrer l’attachement de la République Populaire de Chine à la cause humanitaire au Cameroun, que la Chine soutient aussi bien dans la région de l’Extrême Nord que dans l’Est du pays.  

**Région de l’Extrême-Nord** 

**Statistiques Le camp de Minawao compte un total de 59 479 individus enregistrés au 1 décembre.**

***Protection*** 

Un total de 308 individus nouveaux arrivés ont été enregistré au centre de transit de Gouroungel au cours de la période sous revue. Ils sont essentiellement en provenance de Maiduguri et Mubi au Nigéria, ainsi que des localités frontalières de la région de l’Extrême-Nord au Cameroun. Ils arrivent pour des raisons de protection, de regroupement familial, et en besoin d’assistance.  

Mouvement spontané à la frontière Le 24 novembre 2017, le HCR a effectué une mission à Kolofata suite à un message d’alerte signalant le mouvement de 80 ressortissants nigérians désireux de retourner dans leur pays d’origine par leurs propres moyens. Brièvement stoppés en chemin par l’armée Camerounaise, ceux-ci avaient pour objectif de se rendre à Pulka, au Nigéria. C’est à Kerawa que le groupe a été de nouveau arrêté, avant d’être escorté par l’armée jusqu’à la frontière le 23 novembre, où ils ont été pris en charge par l’armée nigériane qui les a emmené jusqu’au site de déplacés de Banki, jugeant la situation sécuritaire de Pulka trop instable pour les laisser s’y rendre. La mission du HCR a sollicité auprès des autorités la liste de groupe afin de pouvoir procéder à leur identification.  

**Mission du HCR a Mora pour le lancement de l’opération d’enregistrement des réfugiés hors camp** 

Le 1e décembre 2017, le HCR s’est rendu à Mora et a rencontré le Préfet du département de Mayo-Sava. La question sur l’importance de l’opération d’enregistrement des réfugiés hors camp dans son département a été soulevée. Le Préfet a manifesté sa parfaite adhésion à ce projet. Il a demandé à son Adjoint -qui est également Président du Comité Mixte de Protection-, d’organiser conjointement l’opération avec les membres du Comité et le HCR. Le Président du Comité Mixte a par ailleurs proposé la date du 05 décembre 2017 pour le début de l’opération d’enregistrement dans le Mayo–Sava.

***Protection*** 

Le 21 novembre 2017, une séance de travail a eu lieu avec les autorités administratives, les maires, les forces de l’ordre et délégués départementaux du département de la Kadey, portant sur les risques de protection liés à l’assistance via le transfert monétaire (CBI). Cette rencontre qui rassemblait les différents sous-préfets de l’arrondissement, les maires des communes et le délégué du commerce avait pour objectif d’informer les autorités sur l’utilisation à partir de 2018 du nouvel outil d’assistance aux réfugiés (CBI), l’identification des risques pouvant y être associés ainsi que les mesures de mitigation. A la fin des travaux, le Préfet de la Kadey a recommandé la mise en œuvre simultanée des projets d’assistance via le transfert monétaire et de l’autonomisation.  

Remise solennelle d’actes de naissance aux enfants réfugiés à Lolo Après Timangolo, le site aménagé de Lolo a accueilli le 23 novembre 2017 la cérémonie de remise solennelle des actes de naissance aux enfants réfugiés nés sur le site dont les naissances ont été enregistrées au centre d’Etat civil secondaire de Lolo. Cette cérémonie, organisée par la protection, s’est déroulée en présence de l’ensemble de la communauté humanitaire et des réfugiés et a été présidée par le Sous-Préfet de la Bombé qui, avec le représentant du Président des tribunaux de la Kadey et le HCR, a procédé à l’établissement des actes de naissance aux enfants nés au Cameroun parmi lesquels un certain nombre de réfugiés. Ce fut l’occasion de souligner l’importance de l’acte de naissance, qui est le premier document donnant une existence juridique à une personne, lui permettant ainsi de jouir de tous les autres droits en même temps qu’il contribue à la lutte contre l’apatridie. Un total de 193 actes de naissance ont été mis à dispositions des parents pour les enfants enregistrés en 2016 et 2017.  

Réunion de Coordination des interventions humanitaires La première réunion de coordination des acteurs humanitaires initiée et présidée par le Sous-préfet de l’Arrondissement de Touboro a eu lieu le 22 novembre 2017. Cette première rencontre avait pour objet de faire la connaissance des ONG et acteurs humanitaires intervenant dans la localité pour une meilleure coordination de leurs activités sur le terrain d’une part, et pour une bonne collaboration et harmonisation des programmes avec les autorités locales d’autre part. Au terme de cette réunion, les recommandations majeures prescrites par le Sous-préfet ont été les suivantes : instaurer une réunion de coordination mensuelle des acteurs humanitaires et étatiques sectoriels concernés ; partager avec l’autorité administrative les rapports hebdomadaires et statistiques des activités réalisées par chaque partenaire ; le Sous-Préfet en accord avec tous les participants a proposé que la prochaine réunion de coordination se tiendra le 5 Janvier 2018 au Bureau du HCR Touboro.  

Pré-enregistrement des réfugiés à Touboro L’opération de pré-enregistrement des nouveaux réfugiés centrafricains arrivés dans le courant de juillet-aout 2017 a démarré sur le site de Dompla. Au terme de quatre jours de travail (24-28 Novembre), 736 individus (236 ménages) ont été pré enregistrés. Parallèlement, 25 naissances ont été enregistrées, et 106 individus ont été intégrés au sein de 56 ménages. Cette opération de pré-enregistrement a été rendue possible grâce à la mobilisation du partenaire Lutheran World Federation (LWF) et au screening médical du partenaire International Medical Corps (IMC). Il faut également saluer l’implication des autorités administratives, traditionnelles et de forces de sécurité locales qui ont contribué à l’identification des réfugiés centrafricains. Installée au sein des familles d’accueil centrafricaine déjà installées dans le pays, cette population est constituée en majorité de Peuls (Mbororo) et de Gbaya. Par ailleurs, il est noté que cette population est composée d’une partie importante d’enfants non scolarisés et de femmes avec plusieurs enfants à charge. Parmi elles, plusieurs ont fait savoir que leurs époux ont été tués lors des violences survenues dans leurs villages respectifs.",268,"French"

**Contexte actuel du Togo : crise socio-politique**

Le mois d’octobre 2017 a été marqué à Lomé et dans les villes de l’intérieur du Togo par des violences dans le contexte actuel tendu de la crise socio-politique liée aux réclamations du peuple en faveur du vote de la diaspora et du retour à la constitution de 1992 qui prévoit un mandat présidentiel de 5 ans renouvelable une seule fois.  

Dès le 04 et 05 octobre, les manifestations de l’opposition qualifiées de « marche de la colère » avaient dégénéré entre les populations et les forces de l’ordre faisant un bilan de 2 morts, plusieurs blessés et des centaines de personnes déplacées à l’intérieur ou hors des frontières du pays. Ces violences sont montées d’un cran après l’arrestation de l’Imam Alpha Hassan Mollah à Sokodé, dans la soirée du 16 octobre 2017.  

Cette situation a accéléré la médiation internationale notamment le groupe des 5 Chefs d’Etats de la sous-région notamment les Présidents du Ghana, de la Côte d’Ivoire, du Bénin, Niger et le Burkina Faso mis en place par le Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies. Ces Chefs d’Etat réunis à Niamey en marge du mini-sommet sur le projet de monnaie unique de la CEDEAO, le 25 octobre 2017, ont condamné ces violences quelles que soient leurs origines et appelé la classe politique à des négociations pour trouver un compromis.

Pendant plusieurs jours au cours de ce mois, le pays a connu un calme précaire. Le gouvernement en a profité pour aller à la rencontre avec des dignitaires de l’islam pour les rassurer de la non stigmatisation de cette religion au Togo.  

Le HCR au Togo suit de près cette crise et des points réguliers sont faits par la Représentante, Mme Mariam Diallo, sur la sécurité intérieure et la situation sociopolitique du pays. Ceci en vue de permettre à l’Organisation de se préparer à répondre à d’éventuelles situations d’urgence dans les opérations voisines de celle du Togo.

La crise socio-politique au Togo dure depuis 4 mois et c’est toujours le statut quo avec les manifestations de rues organisées par l’opposition presque toutes les semaines.  
L’élément nouveau dans cette crise est l’intervention du gouvernement ghanéen qui a pris le leadership dans la médiation entre le gouvernement togolais et l’opposition. La médiation du gouvernement ghanéen est soutenue par les Nations Unies, la CEDEAO et la communauté internationale. Cette démarche devrait aboutir à un dialogue direct entre les parties de la crise au début de l’année 2018.  

**Travailler avec les partenaires**

Le partenaire gouvernemental du HCR au Togo, la Coordination Nationale d’Assistance aux Réfugiés (CNAR) a animé une causerie sur la coexistence pacifique, le 17 novembre 2017 à Bolou-Kpondavé (à 50 km au nord de Lomé), avec la communauté locale hôte et les réfugiés présents dans la localité dans le cadre du projet agropastoral. Appuyé par une équipe du HCR Togo, ce fut l’occasion pour la CNAR de sensibiliser davantage les réfugiés sur leurs droits, leurs devoirs et les attitudes qu’ils doivent avoir pour favoriser leur intégration locale.  

L’ATBEF, le partenaire de mise en œuvre du HCR au Togo, a œuvré essentiellement pour l’inscription de 13 réfugiés en formation professionnelle dans les métiers de la restauration, de l’artisanat (menuiserie, coiffure, etc.) et l’établissement des cartes bancaires CASH EXPRESS pour eux selon l’approche CBI.

**Santé** : L’hôpital préfectoral et les cliniques mobiles des sites des PDIs de Kaga-Bandoro ont reçu un appui en médicaments d’un acteur humanitaire. Ce lot pourrait couvrir les besoins d’un trimestre. Le 30 novembre, un autre acteur a fait une dotation de 6 moto-ambulances pour faciliter le référencement des malades à partir des FOSA de l’axe Kaga-Bandoro-Mbrès vers l’hôpital préfectoral de Kaga-Bandoro. Ce dernier a également procédé au lancement d’un nouveau projet « d’appui au système de santé » dans la Nana-Gribizi. 

**CCCM/NFI/Abris** : Le 28 novembre, un acteur humanitaire a procédé à la distribution des kits NFI (composés de : casseroles, poêle, louche, cuillères, couteau, seau de 20L, gobelets, lampe, bassine, bidons de 20L, natte et couvertures) à 606 ménages soit 2 857 personnes retournées dans le 1 er arrondissement de la commune de Botto regroupant les villages Balamba, Botto 1, Botto 2, Botto 3,  
Koudouwéssé, Boguene et Moscou sur l’axe Botto. Cette distribution s’inscrit dans le cadre de la réponse aux besoins des personnes retournées (estimées à 90% de la population) dans les villages précités. Avec la période de transhumance qui pointe à l’horizon et les mouvements des groupes armés, l’on redoute une nouvelle détérioration du contexte qui entrainerait de nouveaux déplacements dans la zone.

**Santé** : le 27 novembre, un acteur humanitaire a finalisé les travaux de réhabilitation du poste de santé de Gbadènè, village situé à 24km sur l’axe Batangafo-Bouca. Des lits et des médicaments de base ont été fournis les 1er et 2 décembre par le même acteur. La réouverture officielle de ce poste de santé est prévue pour le 04 décembre 2017. Des cas de pillage du poste de santé et de vol des médicaments pendant les crises qu’a connu la zone en 2015 sont à l’origine de la fermeture de ce centre. La destruction des infrastructures sanitaires pendant la crise rendait difficile l’accès aux soins de santé de la population dans certains villages sur les axes. C’est le cas de plus de 2.696 personnes du village Gbadènè qui sont privées d’accès aux structures de santé depuis 2015. La présence des groupes armés sur cet axe ne favorise pas la stabilité du personnel soignant dans les structures sanitaires et expose la structure aux risques de pillages des matériels et médicaments.

Ce nouvel épisode de violence aurait également entraîné la fuite de plusieurs habitants d’Ippy vers la brousse. Un regroupement de personnes déplacées est aussi signalé au niveau d’une église à environ 5 Km à la sortie sud d’Ippy sur l’axe Ippy-Bambari. Cette nouvelle détérioration du contexte à Ippy survient environ deux mois après un accord de paix signé entre différents groupes armés, qui avait laissé entrevoir une consolidation de la stabilité à Ippy et sur les axes périphériques.

2360084,"Ouverture de deux nouveaux sites pour les réfugiés en RDC Le Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR) a soutenu les autorités congolaises dans l’ouverture de deux nouveaux sites de réfugiés à l’est et au nord-est de la République Démocratique du Congo (RDC), afin de pouvoir assurer la protection d’un nombre grandissant de réfugiés dans le pays. Les nouveaux sites se trouvent à proximité de la ville de Baraka, dans la province du Sud-Kivu, et de Dungu, dans la province de Haut-Uélé.  

Environ 90.000 civils originaires du Burundi, de la République centrafricaine et du Soudan du Sud ont fui vers la RDC au cours des douze derniers mois, portant à plus d’un demi-million le nombre total de réfugiés dans le pays. La majorité de réfugiés vivent dans des zones rurales près des frontières de la RDC.  

La semaine dernière, des réfugiés burundais ont été transferés au site de Mulongwe (Sud-Kivu) qui pourra accueillir dans une première phase 5.000 réfugiés. Ceci permettra de loger de nombreux ménages de réfugiés qui n’avaient pas accès à des abris familiaux dans le camp de Lusenda, également au Sud Kivu, qui est surpeuplé et héberge quelque 30.000 personnes. Le site de Mulongwe n’est pas conçu comme un camp mais plutôt comme un village, les réfugiés partagent des écoles et des postes de santé avec la communauté locale. Les autorités congolaises ont alloué des terres aux réfugiés pour leur permettre de pratiquer l’agriculture et le HCR va aider à assurer leur autonomie.  

Les arrangements seront similaires pour les Sud Soudanais qui seront hébergés sur le site de Kaka, dans la province du Haut-Uele. La capacité du site peut être étendue à 43.000 réfugiés, mais en raison du manque de financement, jusqu’à présent, seuls des abris pour environ 500 personnes sont disponibles. Le site accueillera des réfugiés qui séjournent actuellement dans des zones à risque, à cause de la présence de groupes armés, vers la frontière de la RDC avec le Soudan du Sud. Près de 300 réfugiés sud soudanais se sont installés sur le site de Kaka, avant même la fin de sa construction.  
A Mulongwe et à Kaka, le HCR soutient les autorités congolaises pour améliorer la sécurité des réfugiés.  

Cependant, le manque de financement entrave gravement les programmes du HCR. En plus des 526.543 réfugiés qui vivent en RDC, quelques 4,1 millions de Congolais ont été déplacés à l'intérieur du pays - plus que dans n’importe quel pays africain. Le HCR a demandé 236,2 millions de dollars américains pour ses activités en RDC, et n’a reçu à ce jour que moins d’un quart du montant requis.

Le second a porté sur les « Violences Basées sur le Genre (VBG) et la protection des personnes vulnérables » et du 27 au 30 novembre, au « super camp » de la MINUSMA.

Une trentaine de participants ont pris part à ces sessions. L’officier de Police des Nations Unies et instructeur de la session, Rjiba Ridha, a passé en revue les fondamentaux. Il a rappelé aux agents de la protection civile, les principes de sauvetage, l’utilisation des équipements de sécurité individuels et collectifs. Les techniques de manœuvre du zodiac en l’absence et en présence de vent et de courant marin, les différents mouvements et, les méthodes de tenue à flot ont également été transmises. Un exercice de sauvetage a également eu lieu. Les stagiaires de la protection civile devaient aller chercher une victime (fictive) de noyade, la transporter sur la rive et lui apporter les gestes de premiers secours. « Nous sommes heureux de constater que nous parvenons à maitriser ces équipements nautiques qui nous ont été offerts par la MINUSMA. Nous sommes capables aujourd’hui de prendre ces équipements depuis notre base pour les transporter au niveau du fleuve, les monter et les utiliser dans des situations d’urgence, » a expliqué le sergent-Chef Moussa Koné, Chef de l’équipe de la protection civile à Gao.

La seconde activité s’inscrit elle dans la campagne dite des ""16 jours d’activisme contre les violences faites aux femmes et aux filles"". Elle a mobilisé 17 agents des FDSM dont cinq femmes, tous issus de la Police nationale, de la Gendarmerie, de l’Administration pénitentiaire et de la Douane. Durant trois jours, les animatrices que sont la Capitaine Augustine Nadjikouma et l’inspectrice principale Charlotte Elong Ndoki, de la police des Nations Unies à Ménaka, ont aidé les participants à prendre en compte la question du genre de façon effective dans leur quotidien. « Nous remercions la Police de la MINUSMA pour cette formation qui a un impact direct sur nos activités, » a déclaré Rahmatou Alhassane Walette, agent de la douane dans la Région de Gao. « J’ai beaucoup appris sur la manière d’accueillir les victimes, enfants ou adultes, pour les mettre à l’aise, afin de mieux recueillir leurs préoccupations, » a aussi expliqué A.

Elle a du assister à l’enterrement de son mari, âgé de 45 ans, suite à l’épidémie du choléra dans le territoire de Ngandajika, Province de Lomami, à 80 kilomètres de la ville de Mbuji Mayi.

**Une intervention salvatrice**

Monique était partie à un voyage d’affaires où vivait son mari, voyage qui s’est malheureusement transformé en cauchemar. Arrivée à Ngandajika, elle a trouvé son mari hospitalisé et épuisé par la diarrhée. Elle a juste eu le temps de lui parler à travers la fenêtre entrouverte de l’hôpital où il était interné avant que celui-ci ne décède. Après les funérailles, Monique rentra chez elle à Mbuji Mayi sans précaution aucune.

Retournée à son domicile, elle a eu la chance de rencontrer Francis, relais communautaire de la Cellule d’Animation Communautaire (CAC) Dinanga qui procédait à des visites à domicile dans son quartier, à Lusenga. Ayant pris connaissance de l’histoire de cette dame, Francis a alerté le président de la CAC qu’un cas suspect de choléra avait été identifié. L’information remonta vers le chef du quartier, le Bourgmestre puis le Médecin Chef de zone de santé qui déploya rapidement une équipe spécialisée afin de prendre en charge Monique et de désinfecter la maison et ses environs.

Sans le fruit de ce travail communautaire et des promptes interventions des acteurs locaux, le choléra serait en train de secouer la ville de Mbuji Mayi. Le risque de contamination est important compte tenu des facteurs propices à la propagation de la maladie : densité de la population, promiscuité, insalubrité, carence en eau potable et en toilettes hygiéniques.

L’approbation du DSP 2017-2021, à l’unanimité du Conseil, vise également à apporter la contribution du Groupe de la Banque à la Centrafrique dans ses efforts de sortie du cercle vicieux de la pauvreté et de la fragilité et à réaffirmer son engagement en faveur d’une croissance économique durable et inclusive.

« En dépit du contexte difficile marqué par la persistance des actions néfastes des groupes armés, d’importants progrès ont été accomplis. On s’attend ainsi à une croissance économique de 4 à 5 %. Il est donc normal que la Banque africaine de développement apporte, à travers l’adoption de ce DSP, son soutien à cette dynamique positive », a assuré Ousmane Doré, directeur général de la Banque africaine de développement pour la région Afrique centrale.

S’exprimant lors de l’examen du DSP par le Conseil, Ousmane Doré a souligné que la Centrafrique, qui se trouve aujourd’hui à la croisée des chemins, a besoin du soutien de la communauté internationale, en particulier de celui de la Banque africaine de développement, pour assainir le cadre macro-économique, réhabiliter les infrastructures socio-économiques de base et instaurer un climat politique apaisé dans le pays.

La stratégie 2017-2021 de la Banque pour la Centrafrique s’appuie sur deux axes complémentaires : l’appui au développement de l’agriculture et aux infrastructures en soutien à l’inclusion sociale d’une part ; et le renforcement des capacités institutionnelles et de la gouvernance d’autre part.

Le DSP privilégie ainsi des domaines dans lesquels la Banque dispose d’un avantage comparatif et qui peuvent donc avoir le maximum d’impact sur les conditions de vie des populations.

« Il est tragique que tant d'enfants et d'adolescents ne reçoivent pas les traitements dont ils ont besoin, simplement parce qu'ils n'ont pas été testés », a déclaré Marie-Pierre Poirier, directrice régionale de l'UNICEF pour l'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre. « Nous devons mieux utiliser les innovations pour accroître le diagnostic précoce et améliorer l'accès au traitement du VIH et aux soins pour les enfants. Par exemple, la technologie de diagnostic au point de service rapproche les tests de l'endroit où les enfants fréquentent les services de santé et l'autotest peut être une bonne option pour les adolescents qui peuvent être plus à l'aise avec cela ».

La couverture en matière de thérapies antirétrovirales vitales chez les enfants vivant avec le VIH dans la région est la plus faible au monde car de nombreux pays ont une capacité limitée à effectuer les tests nécessaires au diagnostic précoce du VIH chez les nourrissons. Sans connaître le statut VIH d'un enfant, sa famille est moins susceptible de rechercher le traitement qui pourrait prévenir la tragédie de la mort d'un enfant de maladies liées au sida.

La situation est pire chez les adolescents. Le nombre annuel de nouvelles infections par le VIH chez les 15-19 ans dans la région dépasse maintenant celui des enfants âgés de 0 à 14 ans. Ces nouvelles infections surviennent principalement par contact sexuel non protégé et chez les adolescentes. Tout aussi préoccupant, selon le rapport, est que l'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre a enregistré une augmentation de 35 pour cent du nombre annuel de décès liés au sida parmi les adolescents âgés de 15 à 19 ans - le seul groupe d'âge pour lequel les décès liés au sida ont augmenté entre 2010 et 2016.

Alors que la population des jeunes de la région devrait augmenter considérablement au cours des prochaines décennies, en particulier dans des pays comme la République démocratique du Congo et le Nigéria, il est probable que le nombre d'enfants et d'adolescents infectés par le VIH et mourant de causes liées au sida va rester élevé, à moins que la réponse au VIH - à la fois la prévention et le traitement – ne s'améliore considérablement.

Le rapport souligne que les 24 pays qui composent la région Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre abritent 25 pour cent des enfants âgés de 0 à 14 ans vivant avec le VIH dans le monde.

« Les dirigeants de la région ont approuvé un plan de rattrapage visant à tripler le nombre de personnes sous traitement dans la région - y compris les enfants - d'ici la fin 2018, le problème clé est maintenant d'accélérer sa mise en œuvre », a déclaré Luiz Loures, Directeur exécutif adjoint de l'ONUSIDA. « Les pays devraient d'urgence mettre en place des stratégies plus efficaces pour le diagnostic précoce du VIH chez les nourrissons, et commencer à réduire les inégalités dans l'accès des enfants au traitement. »

Le rapport propose des stratégies clés qui permettront aux pays d'accélérer les progrès dans la lutte contre la propagation de la maladie. Celles-ci incluent :

1. Une réponse différenciée au VIH axée sur des contextes épidémiologiques et locaux uniques dans chaque pays et communauté.

2. L'intégration des services liés au VIH dans les principaux services sociaux, y compris la santé, l'éducation et la protection.

3. L'appropriation communautaire et la gouvernance locale de la riposte au VIH, y compris le travail avec les familles, mieux placées pour aider à réduire la stigmatisation, accéder à la prévention et au traitement.

4. Investir dans les innovations pour éliminer les obstacles à la mise à l'échelle, y compris les nouvelles approches diagnostiques et biomédicales telles que le diagnostic au point de service, l'autotest VIH et la prophylaxie pré-exposition.

L'UNICEF a annoncé la semaine dernière que, au rythme actuel des progrès, les objectifs d'accélération accrue (http://www.unaids.org/fr/resources/documents/2016/20160926_startfree_vision) pour en finir avec le sida chez les enfants ne seraient pas atteints.

**Les faits clés du rapport :**

- La prévention de la transmission du VIH de la mère à l'enfant a été multipliée par 2,5 entre 2010 et 2016 (de 21 à 49 pour cent), certains pays comme le Bénin, le Burkina Faso et le Cap Vert fournissant maintenant ces services à plus de 80 pour cent des femmes enceintes vivant avec le VIH.

- L'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre a la couverture de traitement antirétroviral pédiatrique la plus faible au monde, avec seulement 21 pour cent des 540 000 enfants (0-14 ans) vivant avec le VIH sous traitement antirétroviral en 2016 - contre 43 pour cent dans le monde.

- Aujourd'hui, l'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre représente 37 pour cent des décès liés au sida chez les enfants dans le monde : environ 43 000 décès liés au sida sont survenus chez les enfants en Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre en 2016, soit 31 pour cent de moins qu'en 2010.

- Il y avait 62 000 adolescents (15-19 ans) nouvellement infectés par le VIH en 2016, un nombre inchangé par rapport à 2010.

- Les adolescentes et les jeunes femmes continuent d'être les plus touchées, les femmes représentant près de trois adolescents sur cinq âgés de 10 à 19 ans vivant avec le VIH en Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre.

La déclaration suivante a été communiquée aujourd’hui par le Porte-parole du Secrétaire général de l’ONU, M. António Guterres:

Le Secrétaire général condamne l’attaque qui a coûté la vie à un Casque bleu mauritanien de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République centrafricaine (MINUSCA) et qui en a blessé trois autres, perpétrée par des anti-balaka le 4 décembre à Bria, dans l’est de la République centrafricaine. 

L’attaque a eu lieu à un poste de contrôle de Casques bleus de la MINUSCA près d’un site pour personnes déplacées dans la ville.  Cela porte à 14 le nombre de Casques bleus tués dans des attaques ciblées en République centrafricaine depuis janvier 2017.

Le Secrétaire général présente ses sincères condoléances et sa sympathie à la famille de la victime et au Gouvernement mauritanien.  Il souhaite un prompt rétablissement aux blessés.

Le Secrétaire général rappelle que les attaques contre les Casques bleus des Nations Unies peuvent constituer un crime de guerre.  Il exhorte les autorités centrafricaines à enquêter rapidement sur cet incident et à traduire les auteurs en justice.

Le Secrétaire général réaffirme la détermination de la MINUSCA à protéger les civils et à stabiliser la République centrafricaine.  Il exhorte toutes les parties à mettre fin à la violence et à travailler ensemble pour ramener la paix et la stabilité dans le pays.

2358204,"Adopter des approches différentes pour atteindre les personnes vivant avec le VIH en Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale _Cette semaine, les chercheurs, décideurs, cliniciens et activistes engagés dans la réponse au VIH participeront à ICASA2017, à Abidjan, en Côte d’Ivoire. En plein cœur de l’Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale, il n’y a pas de meilleur endroit, pour les équipes médicales de MSF et moi-même, pour mettre en lumière quelques-unes des raisons qui empêchent des millions de personnes vivant avec le VIH dans la région d’accéder au traitement vital pour elles. Elles doivent être prises en compte pour que le thème de cette année « une approche différente vers la fin du SIDA » se concrétise. Sans cela, nous ne parviendrons tout simplement pas à atteindre les 4 millions de personnes qui vivent dans la région sans être diagnostiquées et ni traitées pour la maladie._

Chaque patient du SIDA que nous voyons arriver dans les hôpitaux en République Démocratique du Congo (RDC), en Guinée ou en République centrafricaine (RCA) témoigne d’un terrible échec pour nous, médecins : l’échec du système de santé à fournir un traitement antirétroviral (TAR) au moment opportun et en continu, pour sauver des vies.

En Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale, fin 2016, seules 42 % des personnes vivant avec le VIH avaient l’accès aux tests, 35 % des personnes diagnostiquées recevaient des antirétroviraux, et seulement 25% avaient une « charge virale supprimée ». A l’ère du « tester et traiter tout le monde », on meurt encore du SIDA. Nous voyons de plus en plus de personnes arrêter leur traitement . Quand ils reviennent dans le circuit de soins, leur traitement est vraisemblablement moins efficace. Beaucoup font face à une souffrance terrible et à la mort. C’est ce que nous voulons prévenir, en tant que travailleurs médicaux. Car, à l’arrivée, c’est à ceux à qui nous prodiguons des soins médicaux que nous devons rendre des comptes, et non aux gouvernements ou aux donneurs. 

Un grand nombre de barrières se dresse encore entre les personnes vivant avec le VIH et le traitement qui permet de sauver des vies, notamment la stigmatisation omniprésente, les blocages juridiques et politiques et une réticence à inclure la société civile et les communautés pour améliorer et étendre la réponse au VIH. Les conflits en cours dans des pays comme la RCA ou la RDC apportent encore plus de complexité.

Pourtant, les barrières les plus fortes sont de loin les problèmes récurrents d’approvisionnement et les ruptures de stock des produits VIH les coûts élevés pour les patients. Dans le même temps, les niveaux de financements internationaux diminuent, ce qui contraste fortement avec les engagements politiques pris afin d’accélérer la réponse VIH en Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale.

En RDC, par exemple, notre personnel est régulièrement témoin de l’impact des ruptures de stock et des pénuries de médicaments et diagnostics. Ceci implique que les personnes ne peuvent pas être testées ou démarrer un traitement. Celles déjà sous traitement risquent de développer des infections opportunistes ou de développer une résistance virale, ce qui réduit considérablement leurs chances de survie.

Beaucoup de systèmes d’approvisionnement de l’Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale ne sont pas flexibles, ni réactifs aux demandes des personnes vivant avec le VIH. Les produits restent bloqués au niveau des points de distribution centraux, n’atteignant jamais en réalité ceux qui en ont besoin. Toutefois, sans un approvisionnement suffisant et régulier, l’organisation de réapprovisionnement des médicaments pour les patients, comme le modèle R6M, testé en Guinée, ne sera pas possible.

Les frais des usagers devraient également être supprimés et des solutions alternatives trouvées pour empêcher les usagers des services de payer les soins. Dans beaucoup de pays de la région, les personnes vivant avec le VIH doivent payer pour les consultations, l’accès à leur dossier, les tests médicaux exigés et les médicaments contre les infections opportunistes. Ces frais les empêchent de démarrer le traitement TAR ou de le continuer. Les personnes qui ont besoin de soins hospitaliers font aussi face à des dépenses excessives .

Au Centre Sida de MSF à Kinshasa, une étude MSF (2016) menée auprès du personnel de santé, des soignants et des personnes qui arrivent avec un stade avancé d’immunodéficience a révélé que ces dépenses pour les soins et les médicaments expliquent en grande partie pourquoi ces patients sont tombés malades et ont différé leur demande de soin. A Bangui, en RCA, les personnes vivant avec le VIH ont récemment expliqué à MSF qu’ils étaient facturés 2,7USD pour un test de dépistage et 9USD pour un mois d’approvisionnement en TAR - une fortune pour la plupart d’entre eux ; c’est la raison pour laquelle beaucoup se découragent et renoncent aux soins.

Le manque de financement international actuel risque par ailleurs de limiter les ressources nécessaires aux interventions clés de la réponse HIV. Les ressources disponibles sont en effet largement inférieures à ce dont la région a besoin pour atteindre les objectifs fixés par les gouvernements. Un « manque substantiel de financements » (selon l’ONUSIDA) menace aujourd’hui les progrès de la région et pourrait même mettre en péril les résultats positifs obtenus jusqu’ici.

Il y a, en outre, beaucoup d’incertitudes autour de la prochaine allocation du Fonds mondial et de sa capacité à soutenir l’accélération nécessaire en Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale. Il est anticipé que les allocations par pays resteront au même niveau que ces trois dernières années, voire diminueront. Certains pays craignent ainsi d’avoir à baisser le taux d’initiation au lieu de l’accélération qui était normalement prévue, ce qui aurait des conséquences dramatiques pour les personnes vivant avec le VIH, envers qui nous sommes comptables – encore une fois.

Le financement et l’appui à la société civile et aux associations de personnes vivant avec le VIH sont aussi menacés, en dépit de leur rôle central dans la réponse, largement reconnu. En Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale en particulier, ceci va davantage affaiblir le rôle clé que joue la société civile pour l’augmentation du dépistage et le traitement du VIH et les services de suivi.

Si nous ne nous attaquons pas rapidement et efficacement à ces défis, le rattrapage d’urgence régional signé en juillet 2017 ne sera rien d’autre qu’un effet d’annonce. Plus important, les personnes vivant avec le VIH ne recevront pas le traitement adéquat, et nous continuerons à laisser de côté de millions de personnes en Afrique de l’Ouest.

**C’est pourquoi MSF appelle à :**

- La mise en œuvre de modèles innovant de soins et de mobilisation de la communauté qui permettent aux personnes vivant avec le VIH de rester en bonne santé sous traitement, particulièrement dans les zones de conflit.  

- Des soins différenciés et spécifiques, afin d’identifier rapidement et fournir un traitement aux personnes vivant avec le SIDA, permettant de les ramener dans le système régulier de soins.  

- Un soutien rapide et effectif à la livraison locale des produits essentiels, et à des plans à plus long terme pour établir des chaines d’approvisionnement efficaces, combinées avec des mesures à court terme pour éviter des niveaux faibles d’approvisionnement et des ruptures de stock. Tous les niveaux de soins du VIH et de la Tuberculose (TB) doivent être gratuits, car le fardeau financier sur les personnes malades et leurs familles menacent l’accès, la continuité et la qualité des soins.  

- Des financements accrus et durables, plus que nécessaires pour mettre en œuvre les stratégies clés de la réponse VIH en l’Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale.",268,"French"

Cet appel, qui s'inscrit en hausse de 11,6 % par rapport au budget terrain de 2017, permettra au CICR de continuer à répondre aux besoins les plus urgents des personnes prises au piège dans les zones de conflit les plus difficiles de la planète, notamment en Syrie, en Irak, au Soudan du Sud, en République démocratique du Congo et au Yémen.

Lors d'une séance d'information tenue hier à Genève, le président du CICR, Peter Maurer, a remercié les donateurs pour leur fidèle soutien et leur confiance sans faille dans la mission et le mandat de l'institution.

« Le CICR est profondément préoccupé par le nombre et l'ampleur des conflits de longue durée qui sévissent dans le monde aujourd'hui. Tant leurs conséquences immédiates que leurs effets à plus long terme sur les millions de personnes touchées ont de quoi nous alarmer tous. Si certains de ces conflits font souvent la une de l'actualité, beaucoup restent au second plan et se déroulent loin des projecteurs médiatiques. Nous lançons un appel à nos donateurs pour qu'ils nous aident à faire en sorte que les victimes de ces conflits ne tombent pas dans l'oubli », a déclaré M. Maurer.

Pour l'essentiel, les activités du CICR restent centrées sur des situations de conflit de plus en plus complexes et visent à assurer le maintien des services de base et des infrastructures essentielles à la survie de la population. La situation est particulièrement grave dans les villes, où les écoles, les hôpitaux et les systèmes d'approvisionnement en eau et en électricité sont souvent endommagés, voire détruits par des années de combats.

« Tirant parti de son accès privilégié aux militaires et aux groupes armés, le CICR s'emploie à prévenir les violations du droit international humanitaire et à protéger la population civile des pires effets des conflits. Nous appelons les donateurs à continuer de soutenir l'action que le CICR mène pour faire face aux situations d'urgence imprévues et aux besoins à long terme des communautés ravagées par des années de guerre », a-t-il ajouté.

Lors de la séance d'information, M. Maurer a souligné la nécessité d'assurer un financement souple avec des contributions non attribuées, afin que le CICR puisse continuer à dispenser une aide sur la seule base des besoins.

2356719,"RD Congo : Des rebelles ont été recrutés pour réprimer les manifestations **Des combattants du M23 ont aidé Kabila à se maintenir au pouvoir**

(Bruxelles) – Des officiers supérieurs des forces de sécurité en [République démocratique du Congo](https://www.hrw.org/fr/africa/democratic-republic-congo)ont mobilisé plus de 200 anciens combattants rebelles du M23 venant des pays voisins pour étouffer les manifestations contre le président Joseph Kabila en décembre 2016, a déclaré Human Rights Watch dans un rapport publié aujourd’hui. Kabila a depuis renforcé sa mainmise sur le pouvoir et a reporté les élections, ce qui suscite l’inquiétude de voir les manifestations prévues faire l’objet à nouveau de violences et de répression.

Le rapport de 78 pages intitulé « [‘Mission spéciale’ : Recrutement de rebelles du M23 pour réprimer les manifestations en République démocratique du Congo ](https://hrw.org/fr/node/311426)» décrit, preuves à l’appui, comment les forces de sécurité congolaises ainsi que des combattants du M23 recrutés en Ouganda et au Rwanda ont tué au moins 62 personnes et arrêté des centaines d’autres pendant les manifestations à travers le pays entre le 19 et le 22 décembre, lorsque Kabila a refusé de quitter ses fonctions à l’issue de ses deux mandats autorisés par la Constitution. Des combattants du M23 ont patrouillé dans les principales villes de la RD Congo, procédant à des arrestations ou tirant sur des manifestants ou toute autre personne semblant constituer une menace pour le président.

« _Les opérations clandestines de recrutement de combattants appartenant à un groupe armé violent pour réprimer toute résistance montrent jusqu’où le président Joseph Kabila et sa coterie sont capables d’aller pour rester au pouvoir_ », a indiqué [Ida Sawyer](https://www.hrw.org/fr/about/people/ida-sawyer), directrice pour l’Afrique centrale à Human Rights Watch et co-auteure du rapport. « _Les autorités congolaises devraient mettre un terme au recours illégal à la force contre les manifestants et autoriser les activités politiques pacifiques des activistes et de l’opposition politique._ »

Les conclusions du rapport s’appuient sur plus de 120 entretiens, y compris avec des victimes d’abus, des membres des familles des victimes, des témoins, des activistes locaux, neuf officiers des forces de sécurité congolaises, des responsables du gouvernement et de l’ONU, des diplomates ainsi que 21 combattants, commandants et leaders politiques du M23. Human Rights Watch a mené des recherches sur le terrain à Kinshasa, à Goma et à Lubumbashi en RD Congo, en Ouganda, au Rwanda et à Bruxelles, en Belgique, entre décembre 2016 et novembre 2017.

Entre octobre et début décembre 2016, alors que la pression publique sur Kabila s’intensifiait, des officiers supérieurs des forces de sécurité congolaises ont recruté des combattants du M23 dans des camps militaires et de réfugiés en Ouganda et au Rwanda voisins. De nombreux combattants y étaient basés depuis la défaite du groupe armé dans l’est de la RD Congo en novembre 2013.

Après avoir été transférés en RD Congo, les combattants du M23 ont été déployés dans la capitale, Kinshasa, ainsi qu’à Goma et à Lubumbashi. Les forces de sécurité leur ont donné des uniformes neufs et des armes et les ont intégrés dans la police, l’armée et la Garde républicaine, le détachement de la sécurité présidentielle. Des officiers de l’armée congolaise – dont bon nombre étaient issus de rébellions précédentes soutenues par le Rwanda et avaient ensuite été intégrés dans l’armée congolaise – se sont occupés d’eux, les ont bien payés et leur ont fourni un logement et de la nourriture. Pour protéger le président et étouffer les manifestations, les combattants du M23 ont reçu des ordres explicites d’utiliser la force létale, y compris « _à __bout portant_ » si nécessaire.

« _De nombreux combattants du M23 ont été déployés pour faire la guerre à ceux qui voulaient menacer le maintien au pouvoir de Kabila_ », a raconté un combattant du M23 à Human Rights Watch. Un autre a expliqué : « _Nous avons reçu l’ordre de tirer immédiatement à la moindre provocation des civils._ »

Les officiers congolais ont renvoyé les combattants du M23 recrutés en Ouganda et au Rwanda à la fin du mois de décembre 2016 et au début du mois de janvier 2017. Beaucoup ont été à nouveau conduits en RD Congo entre mai et juillet et ont été envoyés à Kisangani dans le nord-est du pays, présumément pour préparer des « _opérations spéciales_ » ou des « _missions spéciales_ » afin de répondre à toute menace contre le maintien au pouvoir de Kabila.

Suite aux violences de décembre 2016 et face à la pression internationale croissante, la coalition de Kabila au pouvoir a conclu, le 31 décembre, un accord de partage du pouvoir avec la principale coalition d’opposition sous la médiation de l’Église catholique. L’accord dit de la Saint-Sylvestre appelait à la tenue d’élections présidentielles avant la fin décembre 2017 et incluait l’engagement clair que Kabila ne briguerait pas un troisième mandat ou ne modifierait pas la Constitution. Cependant, la coalition au pouvoir en RD Congo n’a pas organisé d’élections ni mis en œuvre les mesures de décrispation prévues par l’accord.

Le 5 novembre, peu après que l’ambassadrice des États-Unis auprès de l’ONU, Nikki Haley, s’est rendue en RD Congo et a appelé Kabila à organiser des élections d’ici la fin de l’année 2018, la commission électorale de RD Congo (CENI) a publié un calendrier électoral qui fixe la date du 23 décembre 2018 pour des élections présidentielles, législatives et provinciales, soit plus de deux ans après la fin des deux mandats de Kabila. La CENI a également cité de nombreuses « _contraintes_ » financières, logistiques, légales, politiques et sécuritaires qui pourraient avoir un impact sur le calendrier.

L’opposition politique et des groupes de la société civile ont dénoncé ce calendrier comme étant, simplement, une nouvelle manœuvre dilatoire afin d’étendre la présidence de Kabila de manière inconstitutionnelle. Ils ont appelé au retrait de Kabila avant la fin de l’année 2017 et à l’organisation d’une transition sans Kabila. Celle-ci devrait être menée par des personnes qui ne pourraient pas être candidats aux futures élections, ont-ils indiqué, et devrait avoir pour objectif principal d’organiser des élections crédibles, de restaurer l’ordre constitutionnel et de permettre un nouveau système de gouvernance où les droits fondamentaux soient respectés.

« _Le refus de Kabila de quitter ses fonctions comme l’exige la Constitution a plongé la RD Congo dans une crise politique, économique et des droits humains, qui pourrait avoir des conséquences désastreuses pour la région_ », a conclu Ida Sawyer. « _Pour éviter que la situation déjà explosive ne dégénère, les partenaires régionaux et internationaux de la RD Congo devraient faire pression sur Kabila pour qu’il se retire afin de permettre l’organisation d’élections pacifiques et crédibles._ »",268,"French"
2356234,"République démocratique du Congo : les violences au Kasaï **Un défi supplémentaire pour les personnes à mobilité réduite**

Les personnes en situation de handicap ont été les plus affectées par les violences dans la région du Kasaï, au centre de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC). Considérées comme un fardeau, ne pouvant pas suivre les familles dans leur fuite, elles ont été parfois les premières à être exposées aux exactions.

« C'était le sauve-qui-peut ! » s'exclame Véronique. « Mon mari m'a délaissée pendant que tout le monde autour de moi fuyait pour se mettre en sécurité. Dans cette confusion, j'étais désemparée.» Mère d'une fille de 5 ans, Véronique est atteinte de séquelles de poliomyélite et paralysée au niveau des deux membres inférieurs.

La région du Kasaï, qui comprend 5 des 26 provinces de la RDC, a été le théâtre d'affrontements à partir du mois d'août 2016, entre une milice locale et les forces de sécurité nationales. Ces heurts se sont doublés en janvier dernier de violences intercommunautaires faisant des milliers de morts et plus d'un million de déplacés.

Véronique habitait la ville de Tshikapa, dans la province du Kasaï, quand les violences ont éclaté. Esseulée au milieu des combats d'une extrême intensité, elle a cru ne jamais s'en sortir : « je vivais mes derniers jours sur terre. Comme je ne pouvais pas me déplacer comme tout le monde, je suis restée à la maison pour attendre ma mort à côté de ma fille. Je n'arrêtais pas de pleurer en voyant les gens fuir sans nous.»

Il a fallu un véritable coup de chance pour que Véronique ait la vie sauve. Elle a aperçu devant chez elle, des proches de son mari qui quittaient la ville et les a alertés sur son désarroi. « Ils ont embarqué ma fille et moi dans leur véhicule et nous sommes partis sur-le-champ. Dans la panique, j'ai rien pris avec moi, j'ai tout laissé. »

Véronique et sa fille se retrouvent du jour au lendemain à Kikwit, dans la province du Kwilu, 300 kilomètres plus loin, dans une ville inconnue, sans savoir quoi faire, sans ressources et nourriture, vivant de la mendicité.

Suite aux mesures prises par la mairie de Kikwit pour prendre en charge les déplacés en provenance du Kasaï, Véronique a pu être hébergée par une famille d'accueil. Mais les défis restaient insurmontables. Sa fille est tombée plusieurs fois malade, elle n'avait pas les moyens de la soigner correctement. De plus, la famille qui les hébergeait n'avait pas les moyens de les nourrir tous les jours.

C'est grâce aux repas chauds distribués par le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR) et la Croix-Rouge congolaise que Véronique et sa fille ont commencé à manger à leur faim. Accompagnée de sa fille, elle se rendait à midi, avec l'aide des autres déplacés, sur le site le plus proche aménagé pour cette distribution.

Outre la nourriture, Véronique a également reçu un soutien financier. Cette opération organisée par le CICR, en collaboration avec une institution bancaire installée à Kikwit, visait à donner de l'argent en espèce aux déplacés afin de leur permettre de satisfaire une grande partie de leurs besoins essentiels et de pouvoir, dans la mesure du possible, lancer un petit commerce pour survivre. « Cet argent sera en priorité utilisé pour soigner ma fille malade. Ensuite, je pense acheter des biscuits et du savon pour les revendre. Je pourrais également vendre des paquets d'arachides parce que ça marche bien ici. », a déclaré Véronique en sortant de la banque.

A ce jour, Véronique n'a toujours pas retrouvé son mari, ni reçu de ses nouvelles.

Le CICR et la Croix-Rouge de la République démocratique du Congo assistent actuellement 29 000 personnes victimes des violences au Kasaï. Entre août et septembre derniers, ils ont offert des repas chauds et une assistance financière à 9 000 personnes déplacées à Kikwit.",268,"French"
2356229,"À l’occasion de la journée mondiale de lutte contre le sida, l’ONUSIDA affirme que les hommes ont moins de chances d'avoir accès au traitement contre le VIH et sont plus susceptibles de décéder de maladies associées au sida *[Le nouveau rapport](https://reliefweb.int/node/2355829) de l’ONUSIDA met en lumière les angles morts dans l’implication des hommes envers les services du VIH*

**OTTAWA/GENÈVE, 1<sup>er</sup> décembre 2017 -** A l'occasion de la [journée mondiale de lutte contre le sida](http://www.unaids.org/fr/resources/campaigns/right-to-health), l’ONUSIDA a publié un nouveau rapport indiquant que les hommes sont moins susceptibles d’effectuer un dépistage du VIH ou d’accéder à la thérapie antirétrovirale, et plus susceptibles de décéder de maladies associées au sida que les femmes. *L’angle mort* met en lumière le fait qu’à travers le monde, moins de la moitié des hommes séropositifs au VIH sont sous traitement, en comparaison avec 60 % des femmes. Les études montrent que les hommes sont plus susceptibles que les femmes de débuter le traitement tardivement, de l’interrompre et d’être perdus au cours du suivi du traitement.

« Lutter contre les inégalités qui mettent en danger les femmes et les filles face au VIH est la priorité absolue de la riposte contre le sida, » déclare Michel Sidibé, Directeur exécutif de l'ONUSIDA. « Mais il existe un angle mort concernant les hommes : les hommes n’utilisent pas les services destinés à la prévention du VIH ou au dépistage du VIH, et ils n’ont pas accès au traitement de la même manière que les femmes. »

En Afrique subsaharienne, les hommes et les garçons vivant avec le VIH ont 20 % de chances en moins de connaitre leur état sérologique que les femmes et les filles séropositives au VIH, et sont moins susceptibles à 27 % d’avoir accès au traitement. Au KwaZulu-Natal, province dont la prévalence au VIH est la plus élevée en Afrique du Sud, seul un homme sur quatre âgé entre 20 et 24 ans vivant avec le VIH a appris qu'il avait contracté le virus en 2015.

En Afrique Centrale et de l’Ouest, une région qui lutte pour riposter efficacement contre le VIH, seuls 25 % des hommes séropositifs au VIH ont accès au traitement. Lorsque les personnes ne sont pas sous traitement, elles sont plus susceptibles de transmettre le VIH.

« Lorsque les hommes ont accès aux services de traitement et de prévention du VIH, apparait alors un triple dividende » ajoute M. Sidibé. « Ils se protègent eux-mêmes, ils protègent leurs partenaires sexuels et ils protègent leurs familles. »

Ce rapport met en évidence des données issues de l’Afrique subsaharienne, indiquant que l’utilisation de préservatifs durant les rapports sexuels avec un partenaire non régulier est faible parmi les hommes plus âgés, qui sont également plus susceptibles d’être séropositifs au VIH. 50 % des hommes âgés de 40 à 44 ans et 90 % des hommes âgés de 55 à 59 ans ont déclaré ne pas utiliser de préservatif. Ces données sont conformes aux études indiquant un cycle de transmission du VIH des hommes plus âgés vers les femmes plus jeunes, et des femmes adultes vers les hommes adultes d’âge similaire dans des zones à forte prévalence du VIH.

*L*’*angle mort* montre également que la prévalence du VIH est constamment plus élevée parmi les hommes dans les populations clés. En dehors de l’Afrique du Sud et orientale, 60 % de la totalité des nouvelles infections du VIH parmi les adultes touchent les hommes. Le rapport souligne les difficultés particulières auxquelles les hommes vivant dans les populations clés sont confrontés pour avoir accès aux services de VIH, parmi lesquelles la discrimination, le harcèlement et le refus des services de santé.

Les hommes ayant des rapports sexuels avec des hommes sont 24 fois plus susceptibles de contracter le VIH que les hommes dans la population générale. En outre, dans plus d’une douzaine de pays, la prévalence nationale du VIH parmi les hommes ayant des rapports sexuels avec des hommes est de 15 % ou plus. Cependant, des études récentes ont remarqué que l’utilisation de préservatif a diminué en Australie, en Europe et aux États-Unis d’Amérique. Aux États-Unis, par exemple, le pourcentage d’homosexuels séronégatifs et d'autres hommes ayant des rapports sexuels avec des hommes sans utiliser de préservatif a augmenté, passant ainsi de 35 % à 41 % entre 2011 et 2014.

« Nous ne pouvons pas laisser la complaisance s'installer », déclare M. Sidibé. « Si nous laissons la complaisance s’installer, le VIH va s’implanter et nos espoirs de mettre fin à l’épidémie de sida d’ici 2030 seront anéantis. »

*L’angle mort* indique qu’environ 80 % des 11,8 millions de personnes qui s'injectent des drogues sont des hommes et que la prévalence du VIH parmi ces personnes dépasse 25 % dans de nombreux pays. L’utilisation du préservatif est presque invariablement faible parmi les personnes qui s'injectent des drogues et le pourcentage d’hommes qui s’injectent des drogues utilisant du matériel d'injection stérile durant leur dernière injection de drogues varie selon les pays. En Ukraine par exemple, le pourcentage d’hommes qui s’injectent des drogues ayant utilisé une aiguille stérile durant la dernière injection dépassait largement les 90 %, tandis qu’aux États-Unis, seuls 35 % environ en utilisaient.

En prison, où 90 % des détenus sont des hommes, la prévalence du VIH est estimée entre 3 % et 8 %. Toutefois, les préservatifs et les services de réduction des risques sont rarement rendus disponibles auprès des détenus.

Tandis que le dépistage du VIH a été en mesure d’impliquer les femmes, et notamment les femmes utilisant les services prénataux, les mêmes points d'entrée n’ont pas été trouvés pour les hommes, limitant de ce fait l’utilisation du dépistage du VIH parmi les hommes.

« Le concept nocif de la virilité et des stéréotypes masculins créent les conditions pour transformer la sexualité sans risques, le dépistage du VIH et le suivi du traitement, ou même simplement le fait d’avoir une conversation sur la sexualité en véritable défis pour les hommes, » ajoute M. Sidibé. « Mais les hommes doivent prendre leurs responsabilités. Cette provocation coûte des vies. »

Le rapport met également en évidence le besoin d’investir en faveur des garçons et des filles à un âge précoce, afin de s’assurer qu’ils ont accès à une éducation complète à la sexualité adaptée à leur âge, qui lutte en faveur de l’égalité des sexes et est basée sur les droits de l’homme, afin de créer des relations saines et promouvoir un comportement sain pour les filles et les garçons.

Les hommes consultent les services de soins de santé moins fréquemment que les femmes, ont moins de contrôles de santé et sont diagnostiqués d’une maladie mortelle à des stades plus tardifs que les femmes. En Ouganda, certains hommes ont déclaré préférer éviter de connaitre leur état sérologique et recevoir des traitements vitaux car ils ont associé le fait d’être séropositif au VIH avec la stigmatisation de l’émasculation. Une étude menée en Afrique du Sud a montré que 70 % des hommes décédés de maladies associées au sida n’ont jamais cherché à soigner le VIH.

Le rapport exhorte les programmes sur le VIH à accélérer l’utilisation des services de santé par les hommes et à leur en faciliter la disponibilité. Cela comprend la mise à disposition de services de santé sur mesure, notamment la prolongation des heures ouvrables, l’utilisation des pharmacies pour fournir des services de santé aux hommes, l’implication des hommes dans leurs lieux de travail et leurs loisirs, notamment les bars et les clubs de sport, et l’utilisation de nouvelles technologies de communication telles que les applications sur téléphone mobile.

Il appelle également à un contexte politique et juridique favorable, qui lutte contre les obstacles communs dans l'accès aux services de VIH, notamment pour les populations clés, et qui soit en mesure de répondre aux besoins et aux réalités des hommes et des garçons. 

*L*’*angle mort* indique qu’en permettant aux hommes de demeurer séronégatifs, d’être dépistés régulièrement et de débuter et de rester sous traitement s’ils sont diagnostiqués séropositifs, les bénéfices ne vont pas seulement améliorer les résultats en matière de santé des hommes, mais ils contribueront également à réduire les nouvelles infections du VIH parmi les femmes et les filles et à transformer les normes sexuelles préjudiciables.

\*20,9 millions [18,4 millions–21,7 millions] le nombre de personnes ayant accès au traitement antirétroviral

1 décembre 2017

Depuis le début de l’épidémie, la riposte au VIH est axée sur les droits humains, l’équité et les communautés, véritables fondements de la couverture sanitaire universelle.

L’épidémie a évolué au fil des ans, frappant de façon disproportionnée les communautés et les individus les plus vulnérables et les plus marginalisés.

Dès les années 1980, les populations les plus exposées au risque d’infection du VIH et les personnes vivant avec le virus affirmaient que les communautés devaient être au cœur de la riposte si l’on voulait surmonter la menace du VIH.

Il est rapidement apparu évident qu’une participation active de ces communautés était un impératif moral, mais également une bonne pratique de santé publique; les mesures de santé publique pouvaient atteindre les populations et les zones les plus touchées, améliorer l’utilisation et l’efficacité des services, parvenir à une couverture équitable et avoir plus d’impact, plus longtemps.

La riposte au VIH a joué un rôle essentiel dans la transformation de la santé publique et a eu une incidence sur l’orientation du programme de couverture sanitaire universelle.

Nous avons accompli beaucoup de choses ces 30 dernières années. Aujourd’hui, 21 millions de personnes reçoivent un traitement antirétroviral qui leur permet de vivre pleinement et d’être actives. Chaque jour, de moins en moins de personnes sont infectées par le VIH et meurent. Mais ces succès masquent les nombreuses disparités et difficultés qui persistent.

Pourquoi, alors que l’on reconnaît depuis 3 décennies le rôle essentiel des communautés dans la riposte au VIH, les populations les plus à risque sont-elles encore laissées de côté, marginalisées et discriminées?

Pourquoi les hommes ayant des rapports sexuels avec d’autres hommes, les travailleurs du sexe, les personnes transgenres, les personnes qui s’injectent des drogues et les détenus, qui représentent 40% des nouvelles infections à VIH en 2016, continuent à être privés des services de santé de base?

Pourquoi un grand nombre de femmes, d’adolescents, de migrants et de personnes déplacées sont particulièrement vulnérables à l’infection à VIH?

Et pourquoi les garçons adolescents et les jeunes hommes n’ont pas accès aux services du VIH et autres services de santé dispensés?

En cette Journée mondiale du sida, nous sommes là pour rappeler que tout le monde compte!

Tout le monde compte si nous voulons instaurer la couverture sanitaire universelle, et tout le monde doit compter si nous voulons éliminer le sida et l’hépatite virale en tant que menaces pour la santé publique. Les services de santé doivent être adaptés pour répondre aux besoins des populations les plus à risque et des populations touchées, notamment en appliquant une politique de «tolérance zéro» pour la stigmatisation et la discrimination dans tous les services de santé, et en faisant des communautés, des partenaires indispensables à la riposte.

Cela signifie également que le niveau d’acceptabilité et de qualité des services doit être élevé, garantissant le maintien dans les soins des patients et l’obtention des meilleurs résultats possibles en matière de prévention et de traitement.

La couverture sanitaire universelle implique que tous les individus aient accès aux services dont ils ont besoin, quel que soit l’endroit où ils vivent, sans rencontrer de difficultés financières. Les personnes exposées au VIH et celles qui vivent avec le virus ont généralement des besoins sanitaires multiples, qui dépassent largement la nécessité d’avoir accès à des préservatifs, à des aiguilles stériles ou à un traitement antirétroviral.

Une riposte efficace au VIH englobe des soins intégrés centrés sur la personne, dans lesquels tous les besoins sanitaires des individus et des communautés sont pris en charge, et pas uniquement ceux liés au VIH. Les pays nous montrent comment les interventions et les services de VIH sont intégrés dans des programmes de santé plus larges et comment ils sont reliés de façon efficace aux autres services, notamment ceux pour la tuberculose, l’hépatite virale, la santé sexuelle et reproductive, les maladies non transmissibles et les troubles dus à l’utilisation de substances psychoactives.

En procédant de la sorte, les systèmes de santé sont renforcés et les personnes vivant avec le VIH peuvent atteindre le meilleur état de santé possible.

Fournir les bons services de santé à ceux qui en ont besoin ne suffit pas. Si nous voulons atteindre l’équité, instaurer la couverture sanitaire universelle et garantir le droit à la santé pour tous, nous devons agir au-delà du système de santé. L’environnement politique et social au sens large continue à jouer un rôle essentiel dans l’évolution de l’épidémie de VIH et pour faciliter ou entraver une riposte efficace. Le principe de «tout le monde compte» doit être inscrit dans les politiques, les lois et les pratiques qui couvrent tous les secteurs concernés, en adoptant une approche pangouvernementale.",268,"French"

La Mission des Nations Unies en République démocratique du Congo, la MONUSCO, a remis à la Commission électorale nationale indépendante (CENI) un plan de soutien logistique qu'elle a conçu pour appuyer l'organisation de prochaines élections.

Le 28 novembre, lors d'une réunion, le Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU avait pris note de la publication par la CENI du calendrier électoral pour les élections présidentielle, législatives et provinciales qui se dérouleront le 23 décembre 2018.

La décision de la Mission des Nations Unies en RDC est consécutive à une requête formelle que la commission électorale avait formulée à la MONUSCO dans le cadre de son appui au processus électoral.  
D'après Florence Marchal, la porte-parole de la MONUSCO, ce plan de soutien logistique est similaire à celui que la MONUSCO avait appliqué pour soutenir les opérations d'enrôlement des électeurs l'année dernière et consistera notamment en accompagnement du déploiement des matériels sur terrain.

2356204,"A Genève, l'ONU lance un appel humanitaire record de 22,5 milliards de dollars pour 2018 1 décembre 2017 – L'ONU a réclamé vendredi 22,5 milliards de dollars pour soutenir les personnes touchées par les conflits et les catastrophes dans le monde en 2018.

Un appel record que les Nations Unies justifient par le fait que 136 millions de personnes auront besoin d'une assistance humanitaire dans 26 pays.

« En 2018, un plus grand nombre de personnes que jamais par le passé auront besoin de l'assistance de l'ONU », a déclaré le Secrétaire général adjoint des Nations Unies aux affaires humanitaires, Mark Lowcock, lors d'un point de presse à Genève.

L'enveloppe demandée de 22,5 milliards de dollars est en hausse de 1% par rapport à l'appel lancé pour 2017. Tous les plans de réponse humanitaire portent essentiellement sur des conflits, a précisé M. Lowcock.

Selon le Secrétaire général adjoint, « les conflits, en particulier les crises prolongées, continueront à représenter la cause principale des besoins en 2018 ».

« A l'exception de deux d'entre eux, (les crises) portent sur des situations comportant un élément majeur de conflit », a ajouté celui qui est également le Coordonnateur des secours d'urgence.

**La Syrie, le Yémen et la RDC en tête de liste des urgences humanitaires**

Parmi les préoccupations d'urgence, la Syrie devance le Yémen et la République démocratique du Congo (RDC) sur le nombre de personnes qui seront assistées.

Sans surprise, le conflit syrien, qui dure depuis 2011, reste en effet la priorité numéro une de l'appel 2018, entre l'aide fournie à l'intérieur du pays (11,2 millions de personnes recevront une assistance) et celle fournie aux réfugiés et communautés qui les accueillent dans les pays limitrophes (5,2 millions de personnes concernées). Près de 3,5 milliards de dollars seront destinés aux opérations menées à l'intérieur du pays et plus de 4,1 milliards aux réfugiés dans les Etats voisins.

Le Yémen, en proie à la plus grave crise humanitaire au monde, est la deuxième priorité de cet appel : l'ONU demande 2,5 milliards de dollars (+7% sur un an) afin de venir en aide à 10,8 millions de personnes vulnérables, soit un peu moins de la moitié des personnes qui ont réellement besoin d'aide dans ce pays.

La situation au Yémen devance celle du Soudan du Sud (1,7 milliards de dollars demandés) auquel il faut ajouter aussi 1,5 milliards de dollars pour les réfugiés dans des pays de la région. Mais la RDC affiche l'augmentation la plus importante - 125% - soit 1,6 milliards de dollars pour plus de 13 millions de personnes dans le besoin dont 10,5 millions devant recevoir une aide humanitaire.

Par ailleurs, l'ONU estime que les besoins humanitaires diminueront dans certains pays mais resteront considérables, comme en Afghanistan (430 millions de dollars), au Nigeria (1,1 milliard de dollars), en Ethiopie (895 millions de dollars), en Iraq (550 millions de dollars), au Mali (255 millions de dollars) et en Ukraine (186 millions de dollars).

En outre, les besoins augmenteront en revanche significativement au Burundi (94,7 millions de dollars), au Cameroun (305,7 millions de dollars), en Libye (250 millions de dollars), en Somalie (1,5 milliard de dollars) et au Soudan (un milliard de dollars).

« Outre le coût humain tragique de la violence, les conflits contraignent souvent les personnes à fuir les leur foyer. Les enfants ne peuvent pas aller à l'école. La guerre perturbe les approvisionnements en vivres et l'accès à l'alimentation », a souligné M. Lowcock.

**« Les défis auxquels nous sommes confrontés en 2018 sont immenses »** 

Du côté des catastrophes, l'ONU estime que les sécheresses, les inondations, les ouragans et autres désastres naturelles créeront également des besoins humanitaires. « Certains spécialistes prévoient un risque accru de tremblements de terre en 2018 », ont indiqué les Nations Unies.

« Les défis auxquels nous sommes confrontés en 2018 sont immenses. Avec l'appui des donateurs, nous pouvons être plus efficaces et plus efficients dans la réponse aux besoins de millions de personnes dans le monde », a fait remarquer le chef de l'humanitaire de l'ONU.

En 2017, les humanitaires ont atteint plus de civils que jamais auparavant. Des dizaines de millions de personnes ont été assistées, dont des millions de vies sauvées.

Malgré les difficultés liées aux conflits, l'aide a pu être acheminée à un coût de 230 dollars en moyenne par personne. Toutefois, les appels humanitaires sont rarement couverts à 100% par les donateurs. A la fin novembre, l'ONU n'avait reçu que 13 milliards de dollars sur 22,2 demandés pour 2017.",268,"French"

On trouvera, ci-après, le message du Secrétaire général de l’ONU, M. António Guterres, à l’occasion de la Journée mondiale de lutte contre le sida, célébrée le 1er décembre:

Le monde est en bonne voie pour atteindre l’objectif de mettre fin à l’épidémie de sida d’ici à 2030. Près de 21 millions de personnes vivant avec le VIH sont désormais sous traitement et ils devraient être plus de 30 millions d’ici à 2020. Les décès liés au sida et les nouvelles infections au VIH sont sur le déclin. Si l’on peut se réjouir que le monde tienne sa promesse, beaucoup de chemin reste encore à parcourir.

Nous sommes malheureusement en retard sur certains éléments de la riposte contre le VIH. Dans certaines régions du monde, des succès obtenus de haute lutte sont en train d’être annihilés, les nouvelles infections au VIH et les décès liés au sida reprenant du terrain.

Les femmes et les filles continuent d’être touchées de façon disproportionnée par le VIH, en particulier en Afrique. Les hommes sont moins enclins à savoir qu’ils vivent avec le virus, moins enclins à chercher un traitement, et de ce fait, plus susceptibles de transmettre le VIH. Beaucoup trop de gens ont du mal à accéder aux services dont ils ont besoin pour se faire traiter ou se maintenir en bonne santé.

En cette Journée mondiale de lutte contre le sida, je lance un appel pour que nous nous engagions une nouvelle fois à terminer ce que nous avons commencé et à faire de l’épidémie du sida une chose du passé.

2356194,"République centrafricaine: des ex-combattants commencent une nouvelle vie **La FAO contribue à rétablir la paix et à stimuler l’économie dans le pays ravagé par la guerre**

**01 décembre 2017, Rome/Bangui** - Plus de 1000 anciens combattants centrafricains ont rejoint une [initiative de l'ONU](https://minusca.unmissions.org/en/DDR_En) dans le pays visant à les désarmer, les démobiliser et à les réintégrer dans la société.

Le message du programme est simple: ne prenez plus part aux actes de violence, déposez les armes et, en échange, nous vous aiderons à commencer une nouvelle vie. Les participants bénéficient de plusieurs formations au choix : jardinage, horticulture, élevage de poulets ou encore de porcs et reçoivent des outils, des semences et des poussins pour pouvoir démarrer leur entreprise.

«Cette initiative représente une étape importante pour parvenir à la paix et restaurer l'espoir. Ces derniers temps, nous avons constaté un regain de tension, de violences, comme celles enregistrées en 2013-2014, donc le fait de donner à ces groupes armés une option, une issue, arrive véritablement à point nommé», a déclaré M. Jean-Alexandre Scaglia, Représentant de la FAO en République centrafricaine.

**Un nouveau départ**

Agé de 28 ans, Moussa (le nom a été changé) est un ancien combattant. Il s'occupe à présent de ses animaux dans un quartier de la capitale Bangui, réputé pour avoir été le théâtre de nombreux affrontements. Il a récemment vendu un de ses porcs, qu'il a reçu grâce au programme de l'ONU, et avec l'argent a lancé sa petite affaire. Il achète et vend maintenant des matelas et des panneaux.

«Je ne sais même pas pourquoi je me battais. Cela n'a pas de sens et cela ne m'a mené nulle part. Ma mère est musulmane et mon père est chrétien. Donc, contre quoi me battais-je ?», dit-il, non sans amertume.

«J'ai choisi de suivre la formation sur l'élevage de porcs. Je dois dire que c'est une nouvelle porte qui s'ouvre à moi, surtout après avoir eu mon certificat. Je veux contribuer à restaurer la paix dans mon pays et pouvoir me bâtir une meilleure vie», a-t-il ajouté.

D'autres jeunes comme Moussa ont choisi de se former dans l'agriculture et apprennent à cultiver des légumes, tandis que d'autres sont occupés à réparer les routes et les infrastructures publiques détruites par les conflits.

«Le programme leur permet de bien gagner leurs vies. Le salaire moyen d'un centrafricain tourne autour des 50 000 FCFA, alors que ces activités peuvent leur rapporter entre 200 000 et 300 000 FCFA par mois. Le programme ne contribue pas seulement à restaurer la paix, il stimule l'économie et permet aux jeunes de participer à la reconstruction de leur pays», a ajouté M. Scaglia.

La formation qui s'étale sur trois mois se déroule à Bangui et dans plusieurs autres régions du pays, celles qui ont été les plus touchées par les conflits (telles que Kaga Bandoro, Bambari et Haute Kotto) et où vivent toujours des centaines de milliers de déplacés.

Il n'y a pas si longtemps, ici, dans des salles de couleur vive, dans des mairies vieillissantes ou encore dans des logements militaires abandonnés, ces anciens combattants - hommes et femmes confondus - ont été impliqués dans des actes de violences qui ont fini par diviser le pays et horrifié le monde entier. A présent, tous sont sagement assis devant leurs bureaux, désireux d'apprendre.

Marie (son nom a été changé), ancienne combattante, vient d'achever sa formation en élevage de poulet.

Elle a déjà élevé et vendu près de 600 poulets et vient d'en acheter 1000 autres. La jeune femme a réinvesti ses recettes et vend maintenant des beignets de bananes, ce qui lui permet d'augmenter ses revenus.

«Avant la crise, c'était difficile de trouver du travail même en ayant étudié l'informatique et l'administration. Lorsque la guerre a commencé, je me suis rapprochée de plusieurs membres de la rébellion. C'est ainsi que tout a commencé. Je me suis rapprochée d'eux car j'avais besoin de trouver un travail. Je sais maintenant que cette nouvelle activité m'aidera à retrouver une vie normale», a déclaré Marie.

Pour Marie, une vie normale ne signifie pas seulement être capable de gagner assez pour subvenir à ses besoins, mais aussi être capable de circuler librement et d'être acceptée par sa communauté.

La FAO soutient le développement de l'initiative de l'ONU visant à désarmer, démobiliser et réintégrer ces anciens combattants qui, dans le cadre d'un nouveau projet, auront également accès à des programmes de micro-crédit pour lancer leur propre entreprise.

**La population centrafricaine ne peut pas attendre**

De nouveaux troubles ont poussé le pays dans sa quatrième année de conflit. Plus d'un million de personnes ont fui leurs domiciles, parfois au-delà des frontières ou vers des camps de déplacés internes.

Une personne sur deux souffre de la faim.

La FAO a besoin de manière urgente de 10 millions dollars d'ici février pour venir en aide à plus de 350 000 personnes - des déplacés et des communautés hôtes vulnérables - afin qu'elles puissent reprendre leurs activités agricoles et se préparer pour la prochaine saison de récolte (qui va de mars à avril 2018) en leur fournissant des semences, des outils et des services vétérinaires basiques pour leur bétail.

On trouvera ci-après le message du Secrétaire général de l’ONU, M. António Guterres, à l’occasion de la Journée internationale des personnes handicapées, célébrée le 3 décembre, et cette année, sur le thème « Transformer nos sociétés pour les rendre viables et résilientes pour tous »:

La résilience est essentielle pour parvenir au développement durable. Adopté avec la promesse de ne pas faire de laissés-pour-compte, le Programme 2030 consacre l’engagement à donner des moyens d’action aux victimes de la marginalisation et de l’exclusion, pour réduire leur vulnérabilité aux chocs économiques, sociaux et environnementaux.

Ces dernières années, la communauté internationale a fait des progrès remarquables dans la promotion des droits du milliard de personnes handicapées que compte la planète. Le Programme 2030, le Nouveau Programme pour les villes et le Cadre de Sendai pour la réduction des risques de catastrophe reconnaissent le handicap comme une question transversale.

Pour autant, les personnes handicapées restent trop souvent maintenues à l’écart de la conception, de la planification et de la mise en œuvre des politiques et programmes qui ont une incidence sur leur vie. Trop souvent, elles subissent la discrimination dans l’accès à l’emploi, à l’éducation et à d’autres services.

Pour surmonter ce problème, il faut garantir aux personnes handicapées, avec leur consentement et leur participation, des installations, technologies, infrastructures, services et produits modulables, accessibles et utilisables. Nous devons nous appuyer sur la connaissance que les personnes handicapées ont de leur situation pour concevoir, élaborer et mettre en œuvre des solutions novatrices et abordables permettant d’assurer l’égalité pour tous.

À l’occasion de la Journée internationale des personnes handicapées, engageons-nous à faire tomber les barrières physiques et culturelles, à construire des sociétés résilientes et à créer des opportunités qui nous aideront véritablement à ne pas faire de laissés-pour-compte.

2356184,"Le programme de travail du Conseil de sécurité marqué au mois de décembre par les défis posés par la RPDC, les armes légères et le Moyen-Orient CONF171201-CS

Le programme de travail du Conseil de sécurité est, ce mois-ci, marqué par la « menace très forte » posée par la République populaire démocratique de Corée (RPDC), les armes légères et la situation au Moyen-Orient, a annoncé devant la presse, cet après-midi, le Représentant permanent du Japon, M. Koro Bessho, dont le pays préside l’organe chargé du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales.

Le programme nucléaire de la RPDC sera abordé, le 15 décembre, lors d’une séance publique du Conseil qui se tiendra en présence du Secrétaire général, M. António Guterres, et devrait être présidée par le Ministre japonais des affaires étrangères.  « Nous essayons d’aboutir à un produit après cette réunion », a précisé le représentant, en ajoutant que la RPDC ne s’était pas encore rapprochée de la présidence en vue d’y participer. 

M. Bessho a en outre plaidé pour une mise en œuvre « plus efficace » et « plus loyale » de la résolution 2375 (2017), qui impose contre la RPDC le régime de sanctions le plus sévère au monde.  « C’est une très bonne résolution », a-t-il dit, en soulignant la nécessité de maintenir une pression maximale pour que le RPDC change de direction.  « Nous voulons que la RPDC change de politique », a-t-il insisté. 

Interrogé sur la tenue d’une séance publique du Conseil sur la situation des droits de l’homme en RPDC, le représentant du Japon a insisté sur le lien fort qui existe entre la situation des droits de l’homme et le programme nucléaire de la RPDC.  Il a jugé utile que la communauté internationale soit pleinement informée de cette corrélation, a soutenu M. Bessho. 

Répondant à un correspondant de presse, le représentant a affirmé que le Japon faisait « tout ce qu’il peut pour défendre son peuple ».  Le 29 novembre dernier, la RPDC avait procédé à un tir balistique d’une portée sans précédent, qui avait survolé le Japon avant de s’abîmer en mer. 

Il a en revanche refusé de commenter les propos de la déléguée des États-Unis qui avait affirmé, lors d’une réunion d’urgence du Conseil convoquée au lendemain du tir précité, que si une guerre survenait, « le régime nord-coréen serait totalement détruit ».  « Personne ne veut d’une solution militaire », a-t-il néanmoins dit, avant de plaider pour le maintien des exercices militaires conjoints avec les États-Unis. 

Toujours sur le continent asiatique, le Conseil discutera de la situation au Myanmar, le 12 décembre, lors d’une séance publique qui verra le Secrétaire général adjoint aux affaires politiques, M. Jeffrey Feltman, prendre la parole.  La Mission d’assistance des Nations Unies en Afghanistan (MANUA) sera l’objet d’un débat le 21 décembre. 

Le seul débat public au menu du Conseil de sécurité aura lieu le 20 décembre en présence du Secrétaire général et sera consacré aux « défis complexes contemporains » posés à la paix et à la sécurité internationales, a précisé le délégué.  M. Bessho a souligné la nécessité de conjuguer efforts de prévention et de règlement des conflits et consolidation de la paix, en remédiant aux causes profondes des crises. 

Une séance d’information sur les armes légères aura lieu le 18 décembre, avec l’intervention prévue de la Secrétaire générale adjointe et Haut-Représentante aux affaires de désarmement, Mme Izumi Nakamitsu.  « C’est un sujet peu traité par le Conseil mais les armes légères représentent un défi sérieux », a déclaré le délégué japonais, en espérant que la communauté internationale y prête une attention accrue.  « Le Japon est attentif depuis longtemps à cette question. »

La situation au Moyen-Orient sera un autre grand axe du programme de travail du Conseil, a poursuivi M. Bessho.  Le 5 décembre, le Conseil entendra l’Envoyé spécial pour le Yémen, M. Ismail Ould Check Ahmed, parler de la situation dans ce pays.  Le 14 décembre, l’Envoyé spécial pour la Syrie, M. Staffan de Mistura, informera le Conseil des derniers avancements des pourparlers intersyriens de Genève.

« Nous voulons aller de l’avant », a affirmé, à ce propos, le représentant du Japon.  Évoquant les trois projets de résolution sur le Mécanisme d’enquête conjoint sur les armes chimiques en Syrie qui avaient été rejetés en novembre, le délégué a indiqué qu’il y avait un consensus, au sein du Conseil, autour de la nécessité de traduire en justice les auteurs d’attaques chimiques.  « Nous devons faire quelque chose. »

Le 19 décembre, le Secrétaire général adjoint aux affaires humanitaires, M. Mark Lowcock, fera le point sur la situation humanitaire en Syrie, qui a connu quelques améliorations mais est encore « loin d’être satisfaisante », a précisé le délégué.  Le Conseil se penchera sur le processus de paix au Moyen-Orient lors d’une séance publique prévue le 18 décembre. 

Les questions africaines seront abordées, le 7 décembre, lors d’un débat consacré à la Mission des Nations Unies au Soudan du Sud (MINUSS) et le 13, lorsque le Conseil entendra le Chef du Bureau régional des Nations Unies pour l’Afrique centrale (BRENUAC) M. François Louncény Fall.  Une adoption sur la MINUSS est prévue le 14 décembre au matin. 

Enfin, les activités des tribunaux pénaux internationaux seront examinées le 6 décembre au matin en présence, notamment, du Président du Tribunal pénal international pour l’ex-Yougoslavie, M. Carmel Agius.  La Procureure de la Cour pénale internationale (CPI) s’exprimera, elle, le 12 décembre matin sur la situation au Soudan.

2355624,"Plus de 12 000 Congolais ont déjà fui vers la Zambie, affectée par une extrême pénurie de fonds pour l’aide humanitaire **Ceci est un résumé des déclarations du porte-parole du HCR Babar Baloch – à qui toute citation peut être attribuée – lors de la conférence de presse du 01 décembre 2017 au Palais des Nations à Genève.**

Le nombre de réfugiés ayant fui les violences des milices dans le sud-est de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC) vers la Zambie a passé le cap des 12 000 - avec plus de 8 400 arrivants ces trois derniers mois.

Environ 80 % des réfugiés sont des femmes et des enfants, chassés de chez eux par l’extrême brutalité des milices se livrant à de multiples saccages. Des civils auraient été tués, des femmes violées, des biens privés pillés et des maisons incendiées. La plupart des réfugiés proviennent des provinces du Haut-Katanga et du Tanganyika (RDC).

La majorité des réfugiés ont traversé la frontière vers la province de Luapula et sont hébergés au Centre de transit de Kenani à Nchelenge, à environ 90 kilomètres de la frontière. Des personnes entrent également en Zambie dans d’autres provinces du nord et du nord-ouest du pays.

Selon les réfugiés, davantage encore pourraient être forcés de quitter la RDC pour rejoindre la Zambie, car les combats s’intensifient. Quelque 4,1 millions de personnes sont toujours déplacées à l’intérieur de la RDC.

Le centre de transit de Kenani accueille actuellement plus de 8 000 réfugiés. Il a désormais dépassé sa capacité initiale d’accueil. La Zambie a alloué davantage de terrains pour établir un nouveau site afin d’alléger la pression sur le site existant et d’accueillir les nouveaux arrivants. Cependant, le HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés et ses partenaires ont un besoin urgent de ressources pour développer le nouveau site et permettre aux réfugiés de recevoir une aide vitale, y compris de la nourriture, des abris, de l’eau, des installations d’assainissement et l’accès aux services de santé.

Les activités humanitaires en RDC et en Zambie sont extrêmement sous-financées. Sur les 236,2 millions de dollars nécessaires pour répondre aux besoins des réfugiés, des personnes déplacées internes et autres en RDC, seuls 54,6 millions de dollars ont été reçus à ce jour. En Zambie, seuls 13,6 millions de dollars ont été reçus. Dans les deux cas, cela représente moins du quart de ce qui est nécessaire.

La Zambie accueille actuellement plus de 65 000 réfugiés, dont environ 33 000 de la RDC.

2355414,"Mali : L’Expert indépendant conclut sa mission au Mali BAMAKO / GENEVE (1er décembre 2017) – Au terme de sa neuvième visite dans le pays du 27 novembre au 1er décembre 2017, Suliman Baldo, l’Expert indépendant sur la situation des droits de l’homme au Mali, a exprimé ses inquiétudes par rapport à la situation des droits de l’homme au nord et au centre du pays, y compris des droits civils, politiques, économiques, sociaux et culturels.  

"" Le Mali connait des défis énormes et multiformes dans les domaines de la gouvernance, de la sécurité et du développement. Cette situation précaire crée un environnement favorable à la multiplication des violations graves des droits fondamentaux de l’homme "" a déploré M. Baldo. 
  
Le nombre d'incidents de sécurité a augmenté de façon alarmante et cette détérioration de la situation sécuritaire affecte de nombreuses populations civiles qui sont ciblées soit par les extrémistes, soit par les criminels.  M. Baldo a noté que "" l’insécurité qui affecte la population dans certaines zones du nord et du centre a déjà entraîné la fermeture de plusieurs centaines d’écoles, ce qui est inacceptable. ""   

Il a condamné toutes les attaques contre les civils, les acteurs humanitaires, les officiers de maintien de la paix et les forces de sécurité du Mali. L’Expert a demandé que les auteurs et instigateurs de ces attaques soient traduits en justice.  Il a rappelé notamment que la Cour Pénale Internationale est saisie du dossier du Mali et suit de près ce qui se passe dans le pays.    

L'attaque du convoi du Président de la Haute Cour de Justice du Mali et l’enlèvement du Président du tribunal de Niono traduisent une stratégie visant à cibler les symboles de la présence de l’Etat Malien. La multiplication des attaques dans les régions de Kidal, Mopti et Ségou et la manifestation de la présence de groupes terroristes armés sont également préoccupantes.  

L'Expert indépendant a appris que le nombre d'attaques contre les acteurs humanitaires a doublé en 2017 par rapport à 2016. "" Les acteurs humanitaires m’ont dit que la crise humanitaire s’accentue mais devient une crise oubliée car la réponse à cette crise malienne est l’une des moins financées au monde. "",  a déploré M. Baldo.  

Presque 20% de la population est en situation d’insécurité alimentaire et 1.2 millions de personnes ont besoin d’un appui en eau, hygiène et assainissement. L’absence des autorités locales ou la faiblesse de leurs capacités entravent la fourniture des services de base et en plus l’insécurité qui prévaut dans certaines régions du pays entrave l’acheminement de l’aide aux plus vulnérables "" a déclaré M. Baldo.    

L’Expert indépendant s’est félicité de l’initiative régionale pour lutter contre le terrorisme et les groupes extrémistes violents et l’opérationnalisation de la force conjointe du G5 Sahel. Cet effort va contribuer à créer un environnement plus sûr au Mali et dans la région. L’expert a souligné qu’il convient de mettre en œuvre une stratégie exhaustive et équilibrée pour que cette lutte soit efficace.  

"" La force du G5 devrait mettre en place des garanties et des mécanismes appropriés pour remédier à des violations et abus des droits de l'homme qui pourraient être commis par ses troupes dans le cadre de leurs opérations "", a noté M. Baldo.  

M. Baldo a également exprimé de vives préoccupations en raison de la lenteur de procédures mises en place pour traiter des crimes de guerre, des violations et abus des droits de l’homme perpétrés dans le nord et le centre du pays depuis 2012, y compris des abus qui seraient commis dans le contexte de la lutte contre le terrorisme international. M. Baldo a demandé que les droits des victimes à la vérité et aux réparations soient réalisés et des garanties de non répétition obtenues.  

M. Baldo a exprimé sa profonde préoccupation face aux retards persistants dans la mise en œuvre intégrale des dispositions clés de l’accord de paix entre le gouvernement et les groupes armés de la Plateforme et de la Coordination, tout en se félicitant de la signature le 20 septembre par les groupes armés de l’engagement de cessation immédiate, complète et définitive des hostilités.  

L’expert a conclu sa visite par un appel à la communauté internationale de continuer à renforcer sa coopération technique et l’appui financier au Mali afin qu’il puisse surmonter ces défis énormes notamment la question humanitaire et la lutte contre le terrorisme.  

Au cours de sa visite, M. Baldo a rencontré des membres du Gouvernement malien, des représentants de la société civile, y compris des associations de victimes, des représentants des mouvements armés signataires de l’Accord de paix, des acteurs humanitaires, ainsi que des membres du corps diplomatique et l’équipe pays des Nations Unies.  

L’Expert indépendant présentera un rapport sur la situation des droits de l’homme au Mali au Conseil des droits de l’homme en mars 2018.    

FIN

M. Suliman Baldo (Soudan) a pris ses fonctions d’expert indépendant sur la situation des droits de l’homme au Mali le 1er août 2013.

2355214,"R.D.Congo – Bas-Uele, Haut-Uele, Ituri & Tshopo : Note d’informations humanitaires no 19 (30/11/2017) **Faits saillants**

- La Zone de santé de Fataki en alerte nutritionnelle.

- Médecins Sans Frontières quitte le Territoire d’Irumu, se repositionne à Kisangani et dans les Uélé.

**Aperçu de la situation** 

Le Programme national de nutrition (PRONANUT) vient de classer les zones de santé de Fataki (Ituri), de Basoko, Yalimbongo et Yahuma (Tshopo) en « alerte nutritionnelle » entre juillet et septembre.  
Fataki (environ 90 km au nord de Bunia) apparait pour la première fois en alerte alors que Yahuma (quatre fois), Basoko (deux fois) et Yalimbongo (une fois) ont déjà été cités par le passé. Au sujet de l’alerte de Fataki, PRONANUT Ituri a recommandé une mission d’évaluation d’ici le 6 décembre.  
Toutefois, cette institution étatique envisage à moyen terme l’organisation d’une enquête nutritionnelle dans la Zone de santé de Fataki pour vérifier la situation afin d’orienter les réponses. Le classement actuel de Fataki se justifie entre autres par une épidémie de choléra. 80 % des points d’eau sont non aménagés et exposent aux risques des maladies diarrhéiques. Pour les trois autres zones, on note l’épidémie de diarrhée comme l’un des facteurs aggravants.  

L’ONG COOPI a enregistré 267 cas de violences sexuelles et basées sur le genre (VSBG) en octobre 2017 dans 13 localités des territoires d’Irumu et de Mambasa en Ituri, contre 296 cas en septembre, une diminution de près d’un tiers des cas. Les femmes ont été plus victimes avec 153 cas. 144 cas ont été commis sur les filles.  

Concernant les formes de violences sexuelles, le viol a occupé la première place avec 49% de cas. En deuxième position arrive le déni de ressource et d’opportunité avec 29%. Dans l’ensemble, 239 victimes ont bénéficié de la prise en charge médicale avant 72 heures ; 82 autres ont été accompagnées sur le plan juridique et judiciaire.  

Cette assistance aux victimes cadre avec le projet de COOPI visant l’assistance humanitaire aux populations déplacées sur l’axe Grand Nord – Sud Irumu, Provinces du Nord-Kivu et d’Ituri, financé en novembre 2016 par le Fonds humanitaire.  

Environ 5 000 personnes ont fui les affrontements de ces derniers jours à Opienge (350 km à l’est de Kisangani) opposant les militaires des FARDC et les miliciens Mayi-Mayi. Ces personnes se seraient déplacées vers Bafwabalinga (80 km au nord d’Opienge). Aucune évaluation n’a été faite pour déterminer leurs besoins prioritaires à cause des restrictions sécuritaire et physique sur l’axe Bafwabalinga – Opienge.",268,"French"
2355204,"Cameroun | DTM Rapport sur les Déplacements, Région de l’Extrême-Nord Round 11 | 2– 13 Octobre 2017 **RÉSUMÉ**

La Matrice de Suivi des Déplacements, (Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) en anglais), est un outil de l’Organisation internationale pour les migrations (OIM), qui permet de suivre et de surveiller les déplacements et la mobilité des populations. Elle collecte des informations à différents niveaux, les traite et les diffuse, afin de garantir aux acteurs humanitaires, aux gouvernements et autres acteurs intéressés, une meilleure compréhension des mouvements et de l’évolution des besoins des populations déplacées : les facteurs d’influence, les moyens et durées de déplacement, les intentions futures des migrants, leurs conditions de vie et encore bien d’autres éléments sont autant d’informations recherchées et récoltées auprès des populations déplacées elles-mêmes.

Ce rapport donne un aperçu de la situation dans la Région de l’Extrême-Nord du Cameroun, où l’insécurité liée aux violences de groupes extrémistes armés, et dans une moindre mesure les phénomènes climatiques ont donné lieu à d’importants mouvements de population. Les informations présentées dans ce rapport ont été recueillies auprès de personnes déplacées entre le 2 et le 13 octobre, avec l’accord et le soutien des autorités locales.

- La population déplacée est estimée à un total de 335 016 individus : 241 987 personnes déplacées internes, 29 337 réfugiés hors camp et 63 692 retournés.

- 743 villages ont été recensés, dont 14 nouveaux villages. 60 des villages évalués n’accueillent plus d’individus des populations cibles.

- 92% des populations déplacées le sont en raison du conflit armé qui a lieu dans la région.

- 8% des déplacements sont causés par des inondations et autres facteurs climatiques.

- La population déplacée est composée à 51% d’hommes.

- La population déplacée est composée à 49% de femmes.

- 67% de la population est composée d’enfants de moins de 18 ans.

- Les personnes de plus de 60 ans représentent 3% des déplacés.

- 47% des ménages déplacés vivent au sein de communautés hôtes, 23% vivent dans des sites spontanés, 16% vivent en location, 14% ont pu réintégrer leurs maisons, et moins d’un pourcent vivent dans des centres collectifs et en plein air.",268,"French"
2393519,"Boletín No. 378 - Conocer el riesgo a través del juego y la interacción Bogotá, 26 de diciembre de 2017 (@UNGRD). “Erupción del Saber, Travesía hacía el conocimiento del riesgo”, es la segunda exposición temporal del Museo del Saber en Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres que estará desde el 26 de diciembre de 2017 hasta el 19 de febrero de 2018.

A través del juego, los asistentes al Museo tendrán una experiencia interactiva en una travesía hacia el conocimiento del riesgo que los llevará hacia la compresión de su entorno biofísico y construido en pro de la Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres.

En el recorrido por las cuatro salas de la exposición, se tendrá el desarrollo de un contenido temático basado en tres ejes que permitirá a los visitantes vivir experiencias basadas en: identificar las principales amenazas, las vulnerabilidades y el riesgo del territorio nacional.

Así mismo, se busca comprender en qué consiste el análisis y la evaluación del riesgo del riesgo; dar cuenta de los avances de la Subdirección para el Conocimiento del Riesgo de la UNGRD mediante el Museo del Saber en Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres (MGR) como una estrategia de comunicación del riesgo y evidenciar la importancia del monitoreo del riesgo como pilar fundamental en el conocimiento del territorio.

Los tres ejes toman como fenómeno de referencia la actividad volcánica, como fenómeno amenazante y escenario de riesgo de gran relevancia para el territorio nacional, en aras de poner en evidencia la activación de los cuatro subprocesos del Conocimiento del Riesgo: Identificación y caracterización de escenarios de riesgo, análisis y evaluación del riesgo, monitoreo del riesgo y comunicación del riesgo.
Con Atenea, Diosa de la Sabiduría y el Saber y anfitriona de esta exposición, los visitantes encontrarán juegos y didácticas para comprender la importancia de conocer nuestro entorno y a los riesgos a los que se está expuesto.

Con una experiencia por los volcanes activos de Colombia, Atenea enseñará a los visitantes que Colombia es un país con múltiples amenazas, pero también colmado de oportunidades y bellezas naturales para conocer y aprovechar.",269,"Spanish"
2393509,"Ecuador logra prórroga de 5 años para culminar desminado en la frontera Ecuador logró una prórroga de cinco años para culminar con el desminado en la frontera con Perú, informó este martes, 26 de diciembre del 2017, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Movilidad Humana. 

En un comunicado, detalló que el hecho ocurrió en el marco de la XVI Reunión de Estados Partes de la Convención para la Prohibición del Uso, Almacenamiento, Producción y Transferencia de Minas Anti-personal y su Destrucción, denominada también Convención de Ottawa.

En esa cita se aprobó la prórroga solicitada por el Ecuador para el desminado en la frontera con Perú por cinco años, desde el 1 de enero de 2018 hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2022, indicó. En la reunión, que tuvo lugar en Viena del 19 al 22 de diciembre, el Director de Relaciones Vecinales y Soberanías de Cancillería y Presidente del Centro Nacional de Desminado Humanitario Cendesmi, Efraín Baus y representantes del Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército expusieron los avances generados por el país hasta la fecha. 

En el encuentro también expusieron las causas para la solicitud de extensión del plazo y explicaron que hasta 2016, año en el que se tenía previsto culminar con el desminado en la frontera con Perú, Ecuador logró liberar un ""total de 167 áreas peligrosas en 498 508,38 metros cuadrados, destruyendo 11 431 minas antipersonal"". Ecuador solicitó la prórroga debido a que el terremoto de magnitud 7.8 del 16 de abril de 2016 obligó a ""la relocalización de recursos económicos y logísticos para enfrentar la crisis"", apuntó el comunicado. 

Entre otras razones, el pedido de prórroga también respondió a las condiciones geográficas y meteorológicas que dificultan el acceso a las zonas minadas, añadió. ""El objetivo, a partir del 2018, es liberar un total de 100 496,00 m2 y 3 893 minas antipersonal"", apuntó. La Cancillería recordó que luego de la firma de los acuerdos de paz en 1998, que sellaron medio siglo de diferencias limítrofes entre Ecuador y Perú, se acordó realizar el proceso de desminado en la frontera común de 1 500 kilómetros entre ambos países. 

Mencionó que, como una manifestación de su voluntad política de erradicar de manera definitiva las minas antipersonales de su territorio, Ecuador suscribió la llamada Convención de Ottawa el 4 de diciembre de 1997, la ratificó el 29 de abril de 1999 y entró en vigor el 1 de octubre de 1999. La Convención prohíbe el uso, desarrollo, producción, adquisición, almacenamiento, retención, transferencia; o asistir, alentar o inducir a alguien, a alguna actividad prohibida por la Convención. Al momento, 162 Estados han ratificado la Convención o se han adherido a la misma y faltan 35 Estados que lo hagan, finalizó.",269,"Spanish"

El SINAE, buscando fortalecer las capacidades de las diferentes instituciones que lo componen para gestionar adecuadamente los riesgos, realizó una donación de maquinaria y equipamiento a la DNB para mejorar su respuesta frente a emergencias.

En sala de conferencias de la DNB, el director general de la Presidencia de la República Diego Pastorín,  el director nacional de Bomberos, Leandro Palomeque y el director nacional de SINAE, Fernando Traversa, firmaron el documento que efectiviza  la donación.

Luego tomó la palabra Palomeque quién detalló el contenido y el destino de la donación y agradeció a la Presidencia y al SINAE. Por su parte Traversa destacó lo que implica esta donación para el combate de incendios y mencionó todas las instituciones que trabajan vinculadas a la temática. A continuación Pastorín hizo alusión al rol articulador del SINAE y a la importancia de fortalecer las capacidades de sus componentes. 

La donación incluye maquinaria para el combate de incendios forestales y de campo (chipeadoras, motosierras, minicargadoras) y para búsqueda y rescate en estructuras colapsadas (radares, sierras, taladros). Algunos de estos insumos formaban parte de la donación realizada por la República Popular China y que fuera presentada en el mes de noviembre en la explanada de la Torre Ejecutiva. Otros fueron adquiridos con fondos de Presidencia de la República.

Detalle de la donación, para la el combate de incendios forestales:
•4 chipeadoras

•30 motosierras

•30 kit de protección para motosierristas (cascos, guantes, chaquetas, botas, etc.)

•40 kits de protección para rescatistas (linternas, gafas, guantes de rescate, rodilleras tácticas, coderas tácticas)

•1 radar de localización de víctimas

•2 sierras para concreto

•9 taladros martillo.

•2 cargadores compactos (BOBCAT)

En los últimos siete años disminuyó la cantidad de intervenciones de bomberos por incendios forestales y de campo, según datos del Sistema Nacional de Emergencias (SINAE). En particular, en la temporada pasada se logró reducir en 40 % esas acciones, respecto de la anterior, cuando se registraron unas 4.800.

A partir del 18 de diciembre se reforzó la dotación de Bomberos con unos 150 efectivos y siete brigadas de incendio, que están desplegadas desde el departamento de Colonia hasta la fronteriza localidad del Chuy, con el correspondiente equipamiento y capacitación, informó Palomeque.

Palomeque agregó que se creó un cuerpo especial de 40 efectivos entrenados en búsqueda y rescate de personas atrapadas en estructuras colapsadas. “Esta nueva unidad especializada cuenta con moderno equipamiento donado en parte por el gobierno de China y el resto comprado por la Presidencia de la República”, explicó.

A continuación la DNB presentó un audiovisual resumiendo la capacitación en Búsqueda y Rescate de los 40 efectivos pertenecientes a este cuerpo especial, quienes tienen diversos perfiles desde médicos, psicólogos, arquitectos, enfermeros, entre otros. 

Palomeque recordó que hasta fines de abril rige el decreto 436/007 que prohíbe encender fuego y realizar quemas en zonas descampadas no autorizadas de todo Uruguay. Al respecto mencionó que se dio respuesta a cuatro eventos de gran magnitud, donde participaron además el Ejército Nacional y la Fuerza Aérea Uruguaya,  atípico para esta época del año, advirtió.

“Es necesario que la población tome conciencia de los riesgos asociados a estas prácticas, y que recuerde que existe responsabilidad penal y civil”, enfatizó.

Ecuador logró una prórroga de cinco años para culminar con el desminado en la frontera con Perú, informó hoy el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Movilidad Humana.

En un comunicado, detalló que el hecho ocurrió en el marco de la XVI Reunión de Estados Partes de la Convención para la Prohibición del Uso, Almacenamiento, Producción y Transferencia de Minas Anti-personal y su Destrucción, denominada también Convención de Ottawa.

En esa cita se aprobó la prórroga solicitada por el Ecuador para el desminado en la frontera con Perú por cinco años, desde el 1 de enero de 2018 hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2022, indicó.

En la reunión, que tuvo lugar en Viena del 19 al 22 de diciembre, el Director de Relaciones Vecinales y Soberanías de Cancillería y Presidente del Centro Nacional de Desminado Humanitario Cendesmi, Efraín Baus y representantes del Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército expusieron los avances generados por el país hasta la fecha.

En el encuentro también expusieron las causas para la solicitud de extensión del plazo y explicaron que hasta 2016, año en el que se tenía previsto culminar con el desminado en la frontera con Perú, Ecuador logró liberar un ""total de 167 áreas peligrosas en 498.508,38 metros cuadrados, destruyendo 11.431 minas antipersonal"".

Ecuador solicitó la prórroga debido a que el terremoto de magnitud 7,8 del 16 de abril de 2016 obligó a ""la relocalización de recursos económicos y logísticos para enfrentar la crisis"", apuntó el comunicado.

Entre otras razones, el pedido de prórroga también respondió a las condiciones geográficas y meteorológicas que dificultan el acceso a las zonas minadas, añadió.

""El objetivo, a partir del 2018, es liberar un total de 100.496,00 m2 y 3.893 minas antipersonal"", apuntó.

Durante cuatro días, en jornadas de ocho horas diarias, nueve estudiantes de la UniSimón, regional Cúcuta, 30 funcionarios y 57 líderes y/o miembros de asociaciones de víctimas de Norte de Santander actualizaron sus conocimiento sobre el Conflicto armado y los acuerdos de paz; Memoria histórica, reconciliación y cuidados; Liderazgo y construcción de capacidades transformadoras para cultura de paz, y Cultura de paz y liderazgo para la paz.

El grupo recibió la certificación de mano de la profesional de Participación de la Unidad para las Víctimas Territorial Norte de Santander y Arauca, Betty Rincón Rincón, quien coordinó todo el evento

Una de las participantes fue Tatiana Higuera, estudiante de Trabajo Social de la UniSimón, quien considera que lo impartido le será de gran utilidad cuando en su labor profesional le corresponda atender víctimas del conflicto armado. “Como trabajadores sociales vamos atender a la población víctima, por eso fue muy provechoso  conocer, directamente,  las opiniones y perspectiva que tienen ellos desde sus vivencias,  así como  las falencias que ha tenido el Estado, la familia y la sociedad en general, con ellos. También fue muy interesante conocer todos los mecanismos de participación que la Ley les ofrece para poder orientarlos en mi ejercicio profesional”, dijo la estudiante.

Agregó que desconocía todo lo relacionado con las Mesas de Participación de Víctimas, y que saberlo le permitirá orientar a quienes la consulten sobre la ruta de acceso a esa participación, a la que las víctimas tienen derecho.

En el evento, que contó con la presencia de la Martha Cecilia Guarín Lizcano, directora territorial de la Unidad para las Víctimas en Santander y Danny Ramírez, alcalde de Piedecuesta, se presentaron los avances del trabajo realizado en materia de política pública con víctimas del conflicto armado en este año.

“Hemos sido muy responsables con el manejo de los recursos que van destinados a la reparación de las víctimas, hoy trabajamos en eso, y nos pusimos de acuerdo en cómo adicionar unos recursos para fortalecer el presupuesto de víctimas para el próximo año, considero que el país y Piedecuesta tienen una gran deuda con las personas que han puesto sus vidas y familias en el conflicto y queremos reparar ese daño causado por la guerra”, destacó Danny Ramírez, alcalde de Piedecuesta.

Por su parte la Unidad para las Víctimas, ha venido realizando un seguimiento y acompañamiento constante a las metas planteadas en el 2017 y se hizo la recomendación de fortalecer por parte del municipio la ejecución de recursos que van destinados a las víctimas.

Martha Cecilia Guarín, directora Territorial Santander de la Unidad para las Víctimas resaltó que “aún hay mucho por hacer y trabajar en el municipio, se hizo un balance del plan de acción territorial del 2017, se vienen trayendo recursos importantes sin ejecutar, que como recomendación de la Unidad al municipio, deben propiciarse los mecanismos para hacer la ejecución de estos recursos efectivamente en el 2018, de tal manera, que se pueda llegar con cada uno de los componentes establecidos dentro del Plan de Acción Territorial (PAT) a las víctimas que finalmente son las beneficiarias de estos recursos”

Por su parte, Julio Arteaga López, miembro de la mesa de participación de víctimas de Piedecuesta, llamó la atención a que se cumplan la totalidad de las metas del PAT, en materia de víctimas: “nos preocupa que se hayan dejado de cumplir algunas metas del plan, ya que los recursos están y no se ejecutaron al cien por ciento, solo la mitad; el compromiso para el 2018 es aprobar el ajuste al PAT y hacer algunas modificaciones a varias actividades para que se puedan ejecutar el próximo año”.",269,"Spanish"

Con el objetivo de ir en apoyo de las familias afectadas por la emergencia ocurrida en Villa Santa Lucía y luego que el Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería (Sernageomin) entregara este viernes 22 de diciembre el informe técnico, que establece la necesidad de erradicar definitivamente la localidad siniestrada, la Presidenta de la República resolvió instruir el otorgamiento de dos aportes económicos para esas familias.

“Sernageomin nos ha señalado que la Villa Santa Lucía es una zona de alto riesgo para la vida de las personas. La decisión que ha tomado la Presidenta de la República es plantearle a Sernageomin que tiene que ubicar una zona de relocalización de la villa en un plazo de 15 a 20 días porque hay que hacer los estudios adicionales en terreno y ha dispuesto además que mientras dure esta situación, las familias de la villa van a recibir un aporte financiero para que puedan solventar los gastos que les significa estar en casa de familiares o en otros lugares”, explicó Aleuy.

Respecto al apoyo financiero, el primero corresponde a un monto de $ 250 mil como beneficio de acogida, para solventar los gastos de quienes se encuentran viviendo provisoriamente en casas de familiares.  Estos recursos son extensivos para todos los habitantes de la Villa Santa Lucía y se mantendrán mientras no se habiliten soluciones habitacionales transitorias.

El segundo corresponde a un aporte que va entre 250 mil y 1 millón de pesos para quienes perdieron parcial o totalmente sus enseres, de manera tal que puedan adquirir nuevos bienes.

El pasado año, nuestro país a través del SINAE firmó con la FAO un Acuerdo para ejecutar un Proyecto para la recuperación de los medios de vida de agricultores familiares afectados por las inundaciones. El mismo comenzó a implementarse en agosto de 2016 y finalizó en noviembre del presente año, por un monto total de 480 mil dólares.

En el marco del Proyecto se definieron los 6 departamentos que resultaron más afectados por inundaciones, en términos del impacto sobre los productores familiares: Canelones, Colonia, Río Negro, Rocha, San José y Soriano. Se trata de lugares con importante concentración de pequeños productores, en particular hortifruticultores y tamberos.

El Proyecto tenía dos componentes: por un lado asistencia y capacitación a productores familiares y por otro lado, sensibilización en escuelas rurales.

Para ejecutar el Proyecto SINAE y FAO convocaron al Ministerio de Ganadería, Agricultura y Pesca (MGAP) a través de la Dirección General de Desarrollo Rural (DGDR), a la Facultad de Agronomía de la Universidad de la República a través del Programa de Huertas en Centros Educativos, a la Dirección Nacional de Bomberos (DNB) y al Consejo de Educación Inicial y Primaria (CIEP). Los Gobiernos Departamentales, los Comités Departamentales de Emergencia y los Centros Coordinadores de Emergencias Departamentales (CECOED) de los 6 departamentos, también colaboraron.

**Asistencia a productores familiares**

Los beneficiaros del Proyecto, productores rurales familiares afectados por el exceso hídrico, recibieron semillas hortícolas y/o forrajeras, materiales para elaboración y reconstrucción de invernáculos y capacitación sobre gestión integral del riesgo orientado a la resiliencia productiva y a la cultura de prevención.

En total se realizaron 20 talleres con productores y población rural. Se sensibilizó a 150 familias y se entregaron semillas por un valor de 207.328 dólares y materiales para la reconstrucción de invernáculos por un valor de 31.700 USD.

**Sensibilización en escuelas rurales**

Se realizaron talleres con 77 escuelas rurales, en los que se capacitó a un total de 150 maestros, 1100 niños y sus familias. Finalizado el taller, fueron capaces de realizar una huerta y contaron con las herramientas necesarias para identificar y cuidarse de algunos de los riesgos con mayor presencia en la zona. De manera adicional, las escuelas realizaron un simulacro de evacuación en caso de incendio.

A cada escuela se le hizo entrega de semillas, materiales para la huerta y un kit con material didáctico para trabajar en clase",269,"Spanish"

Los equipos son ideales para el ejercicio de labores agrícolas y pecuarias en la región.**

**EL PIÑÓN**

Cerca de 100 familias del corregimiento Playón de Orozco, El Piñón, Magdalena, recibieron de la Unidad para las Víctimas un banco de maquinaria agrícola consistente en un tractor con todos los equipamientos necesarios tales como corta malezas, rastra preparadora, arado de cincel vibratorio y remolque multiusos.

Los equipos, con los que la Unidad busca contribuir a la mejora de las condiciones de vida de las familias y al fortalecimiento socioecónómico de la comunidad, serán administrados por la Asociación de Usuarios Campesinos de la Población Desplazada de Playón de Orozco, a la cual se le hizo la entrega.

La maquinaria hace parte de la implementación de medidas de restitución de derechos a esta comunidad, seriamente afectada en el pasado por el conflicto armado y que ostenta la condición de Sujeto de Reparación Colectiva.

“Lo que se busca además de beneficiar a las familias del corregimiento del Playón de Orozco es generar estabilidad socioeconómica y el fortalecimiento del tejido social, seriamente afectado por el conflicto armado; ver a una comunidad contenta y dispuesta a sacar adelante sus proyectos con el apoyo de la Unidad para las Victimas y otras instituciones indica que se va por buen camino”,  señaló el director territorial de la Unidad en Magdalena, Carlos Ortiz Ruiz.

Con el fortalecimiento de la capacidad productiva de las familias la Unidad  contribuye a resarcir los daños económicos y sociales que los actores armados ocasionaron a la comunidad, y de paso generar avances en la tecnificación de los trabajos productivos en los  diferentes procesos agrícolas y pecuarios que se desarrollan en el territorio.

El banco de maquinaria es una herramienta de generación de ingresos inmediata, puesto que desde ya organiza un plan de trabajo para los próximos meses, lo cual permitirá, según lo manifestado por los miembros de la junta directiva de la Asociación de Usuarios Campesinos de la Población Desplazada de Playón de Orozco, generar efectos positivos de impacto en el corto plazo en beneficio de toda la comunidad.

**CÓRDOBA**

La Unidad para las Víctimas, a través del Fondo de Reparación, hizo entrega a 45 familias víctimas de 912 hectáreas de tierra y 135 cabezas de ganado.

Dichas familias fueron desplazadas entre el 16 y 21 de febrero del año 2000, a raíz de la masacre de El Salado perpetrada por paramilitares del  Bloque Héroes de los Montes de María.

La comunidad de La Sierra, está ubicada en el municipio de Córdoba, departamento de Bolívar.

En el proceso de Plan de Retornos y Reubicaciones, la comunidad de La Sierra fue priorizada así como los componentes de tierras y generación de ingresos en el marco del cual se entregó en administración los predios del Fondo de Reparación a Víctimas a la Alcaldía municipal de Córdoba, para uso productivo de la comunidad y generar estrategias de generación de ingresos a través de la entrega de esquemas especiales de acompañamiento familiares encaminados a repoblamiento bovino.

Los predios que se entregaron en administración a la Alcaldía Municipal de Córdoba y su alcaldesa Karina Becerra, por parte de Mabel Monroy, coordinadora del Fondo de Reparación a Víctimas incluyen Toloda, San Roque, La Estrella, Providencia y Rabo Largo ubicados en Córdoba, y que suman en total cerca de 912 hectáreas de tierras.

Los predios en mención  pertenecían a Edward Cobos Téllez, quien fue jefe de las Auc en los Montes de María y cuyos bienes fueron entregados al Fondo de Reparación a Víctimas en el marco de la Ley de Justicia y Paz, lo que representa una oportunidad para el fortalecimiento al proceso de retornos y  el uso de los bienes con vocación social reparadora.

Mabel Monroy al dirigirse a los asistentes resalto la importancia de la entrega de los predios y ganado “estamos contribuyendo a una verdadera reparación integral permitiendo que 45 familias, hogares que hoy se benefician, logren desarrollar sus proyectos productivos; le hago entrega alcaldesa y que importante que todas las entidades aquí presentes estén haciendo acompañamiento y seguimiento a los proyectos, lo reconfortante en un futuro será ver los resultados y que cada uno pueda comercializar sus productos. No están solos, no tengan temor, estaremos como Estado siempre acompañándolos”.

Después de los actos protocolarios se hizo la entrega del ganado, luego caminaron hasta el predio la Toloda, se hizo la siembra de un árbol y en un acto simbólico lanzaron globos como símbolo de libertad, perdón y Paz.

BOGOTÁ, D.C.  
Como parte del proceso de articulación interinstitucional que demanda la implementación del Acuerdo Final para la Terminación del Conflicto y la Construcción de una Paz Estable y Duradera, la Unidad para las Víctimas y la Agencia de Renovación del Territorio (ART) desarrollaron un taller en el que participaron alrededor de un centenar de líderes de las comunidades registradas como víctimas del conflicto armado y de 50 colectivos de víctimas en el país.

El objetivo principal del encuentro era presentar la ruta de participación en la construcción de los Planes de Desarrollo con Enfoque Territorial (PDET), a cargo de la ART, y cómo éstos se articularán con la implementación del programa de reparación colectiva que lleva a cabo la Unidad para las Víctimas, en conjunto con las comunidades y los colectivos.

Para Eduar Rivera Pérez, presidente del Comité de Impulso del sujeto de reparación colectiva Pueblo Bello, Antioquia, “lo más importante es mirar y conocer los proyectos que se van a desarrollar con el enfoque de territorio, ya que algo muy valioso que tiene este proyecto es que las obras serán priorizadas y desarrolladas en conjunto con la comunidad”. Los Comités de Impulso son integrados por líderes comunitarios que están pendientes de la implementación de las medidas acordadas para la reparación colectiva.  

La información socializada permitirá a los líderes fortalecer sus habilidades conceptuales y técnicas para comprender los pilares que guían los PDET, las cuales, además, les serán útiles para los procesos participativos veredales, municipales y subregionales.

Para la Unidad es una prioridad coordinar este tipo de acciones en conjunto con las entidades que hacen parte del Sistema Nacional de Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas (SNARIV), ya que benefician positivamente a las comunidades, en pro de la construcción de paz y la reconciliación nacional desde los territorios.",269,"Spanish"

**BOGOTÁ, D.C.**

Durante la presente semana, 200 víctimas del conflicto llegaron a Bogotá provenientes de 26 de los municipios más golpeados por la violencia para socializar sus experiencias de vida y prepararse de manera integral para aportarle de manera positiva, y desde sus territorios, a la Colombia del posconflicto.

La Unidad para las Víctimas lideró el ‘Primer Encuentro Nacional de Convivencia y Paz’, que hace parte de la primera fase de la Estrategia de Posconflicto en el que representantes del Gobierno, víctimas, de organismos de cooperación internacional y, en general de la sociedad, comienzan a pensar la construcción de sociedad en un entorno sin conflicto armado.

Los resultados de este Primer Taller constituyen insumos de la tarea de implementación del Acuerdo de Paz -que se suscribió hace un año con la entonces guerrilla de las FARC—y le permiten a la Unidad para las Víctimas afinar sus programas y estrategias sobre posconflicto de cara a la gestión de 2018 en el que las víctimas son protagonistas y gestoras de su futuro.

“Hemos aportado con el ejemplo. Hemos aprendido del ejemplo de las más personas. Eso me llevo a mis amistades. Quiero agradecer a la Unidad para las Víctimas porque hoy me siento una mejor persona y siento que comienzo a vivir en un mejor país”, añadió.

A su turno, Ener Ararat, del municipio caucano de Buenos Aires, agradeció el trabajo de reparación integral. “A pesar de no haber recibido aún la indemnización (económica) sí me he beneficiado en capacitaciones. Nos trajeron a este congreso que se constituye en el mejor regalo de Navidad para las víctimas y nuestra esperanza de futuro”.

La actividad inició el lunes 19 y culminó el jueves 21. “Como víctima del Valle del Cauca siento que me llevo herramientas de vida para aportarle a mi sociedad. Hoy siento más orgullo de ser colombiano y me comprometo a construir un país mejor ahora que ya no hay guerra”, finalizó Walter Córdoba Garcés, de Valle del Cauca.

El procesamiento y la visualización de los datos humanitarios permite identificar rápidamente las necesidades de las personas afectadas por conflictos y desastres naturales y mapear la respuesta en marcha.

“El nuevo [Centro para los Datos Humanitarios](https://centre.humdata.org/) de OCHA es un indicador del futuro. Nos muestra como las tecnologías que ya están revolucionando cada aspecto de nuestras vidas se pueden usar para ayudar y apoyar a las personas vulnerables a través el mundo”, dijo Antonio Guterres, el Secretario General, en la ceremonia de inauguración este viernes.

“El centro ayudará a los humanitarios a tomar decisiones informada y responsables para responder a las necesidades más apremiantes de las personas”, dijo el que fuera Alto Comisionado para los Refugiados del 2005 al 2015.

El Centro maneja el sistema “Humanitaria Data Exchange” [(HDX)](https://data.humdata.org/), una plataforma abierta de intercambio de datos humanitarios. HDX permite acceder, compartir y usar datos de centenares de organizaciones sobre decenas de emergencias humanitarias tales como Yemen, Somalia o la crisis de los refugiados rohingyas.

La protección de datos es clave en el trabajo del centro para que se respete la privacidad de las personas y no se les ponga en peligro.

**1. Contexto Humanitario**

Continúa el flujo migratorio de venezolanos al país, registrándose mes a mes un incremento en el ingreso neto. El ejercicio de HNO estimó una cifra oficial de más de 700.000 venezolanos con vocación de permanencia para suplir necesidades básicas y en búsqueda de empleo. De otro lado, se evidencia un deterioro de la seguridad en algunas zonas fronterizas (Norte de Santander y Arauca) ante la presencia de actores armados (EPL y ELN) evidenciados en homicidios intencionales en persona protegida cuya autoría no se define. Adicionalmente las denuncias sobre incursiones en territorio colombiano por parte de militares de ese país, estarían verificándose por parte del Ejército y la Armada.

El balance de los dos primeros meses del Cese al Fuego Bilateral, Nacional y Temporal (CFBNT) entre el ELN y Gobierno Nacional, considerando que hay eventos que corresponden a más de una categoría de conflicto armado y de acuerdo al monitoreo que realiza OCHA, se reportan al menos 22 casos de presunta autoría de este grupo armado y tres confirmaciones al CFBNT. Entre los eventos se destacan secuestros, homicidios intencionales en persona protegida, homicidio de un militar, denuncias de reclutamiento forzado, desapariciones forzadas, amenazas, desplazamiento masivo, enfrentamientos con otros grupos armados, incursión y restricción al acceso. En Chocó se ha confirmado una violación y una infracción al CFBNT, además de otras que también se atribuyen a este grupo armado y se encuentran en verificación por parte del mecanismo verificación (Misión ONU e iglesia).

El Equipo Humanitario País (EHP) sigue preocupado por el impacto humanitario dada la presencia, expansión y accionar de los diferentes grupos armados (pos desmovilización ELN, EPL y nuevos actores armados), concentrando las afectaciones en varias regiones del país como: Pacífico, Frontera con Venezuela, Noroccidente y Sur. Estas consecuencias humanitarias se ven reflejadas en desplazamientos masivos incluso en lugares donde estos habían cesado desde hace algún tiempo, ataques contra la población civil, control social representado en amenazas, intimidación y restricciones a la movilidad y acceso, especialmente en zonas rurales y apartadas donde persiste una débil presencia del Estado.

En lo corrido del año, alerta el deterioro de la situación humanitaria y de seguridad en varias regiones del país, a pesar de estar en un escenario de implementación de un acuerdo de paz. El mayor impacto se refleja en el incremento de personas desplazadas en eventos masivos (más de 15.000)
frente a los años 2015 y 2016, considerando que en 2017 hay un actor armado menos que no hace parte del conflicto. Las comunidades afrodescendientes e indígenas siguen concentrando el 782% de la población afectada. Los departamentos más afectados de manera reiterada están ubicados en el pacífico, frontera y noroccidente, repercutiendo en la capacidad de respuesta de los municipios.

Los ataques contra civiles aumentaron un 31% en el último trimestre, frente al mismo período en 2016. Son las amenazas, homicidios y heridos intencional en persona protegida, secuestro y atentados los ataques que persisten. Los líderes sociales y defensores de los derechos humanos
siguen siendo el blanco principal por la labor que desempeñan, afectando la estructura y tejido social en comunidades vulnerables. El número de eventos de restricciones de acceso y acciones bélicas también han aumentado en 51 y 33 por ciento respectivamente, concentrados particularmente en departamentos de la región pacífico. En las restricciones persiste el vacío para cuantificar las afectaciones por la falta de denuncia, además de invisibilizar otros hechos victimizantes que se presentan ya sea como medida de autoprotección o por intimidación de los grupos armados.

Las inundaciones propias de las temporadas de lluvias en el país, es el evento causante de las mayores afectaciones en la población (79%). Las regiones con mayor impacto y recurrencia de estos eventos de desastres naturales son Pacífico y noroccidente (Chocó, Cauca, Córdoba, Bolívar y
Antioquia); estas zonas coinciden con impacto humanitario desencadenado por conflicto y violencia generalizada, configurándose en muchas ocasiones situaciones de doble y/o múltiple afectación. 

Debido al desborde de capacidades de los entes municipales e incluso departamentales, en
muchas ocasiones se emiten decretos de calamidad pública que requiere el apoyo de La Unidad Nacional de Gestión de Riesgo y Desastres (UNGRD). Las organizaciones humanitarias que hacen parte de los Equipos Locales de Coordinación, en muchas ocasiones apoyan de manera
complementaria para el cubrimiento de vacíos que quedan de la respuesta Estatal principalmente en sectores de seguridad alimentaria (pérdida de grandes hectáreas de cultivos), educación (afectación infraestructura, muebles y enseres de escuelas) y salud (física y mental) asociado a temas de agua, saneamiento e higiene.


Las necesidades multisectoriales identificadas en el Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) son el punto de partida y reto que tiene la comunidad humanitaria en el país, para la priorización y enfoque de sus planes sectoriales a través del Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) en las comunidades
más vulnerables. Para el 2018, se estimo la población con necesidades de 4.8 millones de personas, las cuales incluyen a ciudadanos venezolanos (+700.000 personas) que se encuentran en el país en calidad de permanencia, además de otras variables correspondiente a afectación por violencia armada, desastres e incluso contaminación ambiental, que repercuten negativamente en el acceso a bienes y servicios.",269,"Spanish"
2390734,"Más de 16 mil niños del Biobío participaron en programa de educación ambiental CONAF **Programa tiene dos orientaciones: alumnos de pre kínder a primer año básico, y otro de cuarto a quinto año.**

Una de las actividades relevantes del trabajo integral de prevención de incendios forestales que lleva a cabo la Corporación Nacional Forestal, CONAF, en la Región del Biobío es la educación ambiental, el cual se materializa en dos programas: Forestacuentos, que va dirigido a alumnos de Prekínder, Kínder y 1° Año Básico; y otro para estudiantes de 4° y 5° Año Básico.

Ambos programas se llevan a cabo desde el año 2006 y su objetivo principal es fomentar en los alumnos nuevos patrones de comportamiento, a través del conocimiento del medio ambiente y sus elementos vivos y no vivos, junto con el desarrollo de valores relacionados con la protección de los ecosistemas y la prevención de los incendios.

La encargada regional de Educación Ambiental de CONAF, Lucía Romero, explicó que este trabajo se enfoca en 24 comunas que históricamente han presentado una alta ocurrencia de incendios forestales, y que además poseen características topográficas y de vegetación que las transforman en áreas de mayor riesgo cuando ocurre un incendio forestal. “Es allí donde acciones como ésta forman parte de un trabajo integral de prevención de incendios forestales. Tanto el Forestacuentos, como el programa dirigido a los alumnos de 4° y 5° Año Básico, están especialmente diseñado para esos ciclos de aprendizaje y relacionado a su entorno natural”, precisó.

Durante el 2017, en ambos programas participaron más de 16 mil alumnos. “En el caso de Forestacuentos, este año participaron 33 establecimientos educacionales, con 122 docentes, entre educadoras de párvulos y profesoras básicas, beneficiando a 1.991 niños. Este programa, en específico, es una experiencia pedagógica única, que la desarrolla el establecimiento educacional a través de sus docentes, en donde además participa la familia como agente importante en este proceso fundamental de formación valórica de los pequeños”, explicó la profesional de CONAF, quien agregó que junto con enriquecer la educación hacia el medio ambiente, da origen a nuevos patrones de comportamiento basados en el conocimiento y en valores como el respeto, tolerancia, solidaridad, amor y la protección a la vida en todos sus géneros.

En cuanto al segundo programa, este año participaron 203 establecimientos educacionales con 412 docentes, beneficiando a 14.591 estudiantes. “En este trabajo se articulan contenidos relacionados con el medio ambiente y recursos naturales presentes en los programas de estudio de estos niveles con la educación ambiental”, en donde se refuerzan conocimientos y, a su vez, ese conocimiento lo llevan a la práctica en la vida diaria de estos estudiantes. El objetivo final es aportar a un cambio de conducta con el entorno natural”, resaltó Lucía Romero.

Durante estos días, cada una de las escuelas y colegios participantes del Programa Forestacuentos, realizaron sus ceremonias de cierre del ciclo 2017, en la cuales los alumnos exhibieron, ante sus familias y la comunidad escolar, sus trabajos finales, como cuentos inspirados en la naturaleza y la figura de Forestin, símbolo institucional de CONAF, y obras de teatro cuyo eje central fue el llamado a cuidar el medio ambiente y a prevenir los incendios forestales.",269,"Spanish"
2390694,"Consejo de Política Forestal consensuó y aprobó Protocolo de Plantaciones **La sesión plenaria número 18 sesionó en Villarrica.**

El estado de tramitación del proyecto de ley que crea el Servicio Forestal, la agenda programática 2018-2021 y el protocolo de plantaciones, fueron parte del temario de la sesión plenaria, que en su versión 18, realizó el Consejo de Política Forestal, en la ciudad de Villarrica.

En la ocasión, Aarón Cavieres, Director Ejecutivo CONAF comentó que esta sesión del Consejo de Política Forestal, denota un gran trabajo que se ha consolidado como una herramienta central para avanzar en el sector y consensuar visiones en el futuro.

“Esta reunión tuvo como objetivo, revisar las observaciones al protocolo de plantaciones, que tenía como acuerdo acotar la bajada técnica para poder iniciar su implementación y hoy tras muchas sesiones, los equipos técnicos presentaron sus propuestas y estamos en condiciones, en sus aspectos centrales de echar a andar el Protocolo”, informó Cavieres.

El Director Ejecutivo recalcó que se ha informado además de los avances en diversos temas, como el acuerdo del Gobierno –a solicitud del Consejo- de tener un programa de recuperación productiva y de naturaleza en la zona quemada por incendios forestales, así como avances en las zonas áridas y nos queda establecer una comisión para abordar la temática de bosque nativo, que será la base de una política para el bosque nativo. Asimismo, la autoridad recordó que para dar continuidad a esta Consejo frente al cambio de Gobierno, se requiere un plan de trabajo y presentarlo en los ministerios claves y con los parlamentarios de modo que instalen este tema en su agenda.

Para Marcial Colín, consejo de Conadi, éste ha sido un espacio de aprendizaje no sólo hacia el sector forestal, “sino cómo podemos relacionarnos de mejor manera distintos sectores y entender que la inclusión implica participar, tomar decisiones y esa es la lógica del Consejo, creo que es un tremendo paso para la elaboración de una política pública, que debería tomarse como base el trabajo que se hecho acá, pienso que si están delineados los ejes centrales sobre los cuales hubo consenso, me da esperanza que el desarrollo de este rubro, tiene que incluir necesariamente el respeto a los territorios, a los pueblos originarios, a comunidades particulares y de alguna manera buscar solución a los conflictos que existen”, enfatizó el consejero.

A su vez, Fernando Raga, presidente de la Corporación Chilena de la Madera, Corma rescató que la sesión ha estado enfocada en revisar y aprobar los temas del Protocolo de Plantaciones, “con elementos que habían quedado pendientes y, dar cuenta de una actividad de difusión de la existencia del trabajo del Consejo de la política Forestal en los grupos políticos que fueron candidatos a la presidencia en la primera vuelta, a quienes se les explicó he hizo llegar el trabajo efectuado y de quienes tuvimos una buena acogida, promover que el consejo sea una entidad permanente, como está propuesta en la ley del Servicio Forestal”.

Por último, Omar Jofré, director nacional de Mucech, destacó que “fue un acierto político y técnico convocar a tan diversas gentes y especialidades de distintos mundos y realidades forestales para ratificar un hecho que nosotros veníamos denunciando hace tiempo, que el trabajo forestal en Chile está reducido a un sector y no al conjunto; y esta diversidad demostró que efectivamente hay un conjunto de actores forestales que tenían que expresarse y que aportaron a una política nacional forestal”.

Concluyó precisando que el ejercicio ha sido bueno. “Cada cual ha debido extremar sus cualidades y conocimientos para contribuir a esa política, que además de escribir el documento, se ejecuta sobre la marcha, con los aportes de todos, Corfo, instituciones públicas, las organizaciones y los empresarios, quienes han entendido que deben modificar sus conductas para poder armonizar este plan nacional forestal”.",269,"Spanish"
2390674,"El IPC exige garantías para reclamantes y comunidades campesinas de Urabá y el Bajo Atrato **Comunicado a la opinión pública**

21 de diciembre de 2017

El Instituto Popular de Capacitación (IPC) pone en conocimiento de la opinión pública nacional e internacional una serie de hechos y situaciones ocurridas durante el año 2017 y que, respecto a años anteriores, significaron un empeoramiento de los derechos humanos de las comunidades, territorios colectivos y organizaciones campesinas y de reclamantes de tierras en el Urabá antioqueño y en el Bajo Atrato chocoano.

Estas situaciones han sido conocidas de cerca por el IPC, dado el acompañamiento realizado en este periodo a la asociación de reclamantes de tierras Tierra y Paz, al Consejo Comunitario de la cuenca de La Larga y Tumaradó (Cocolatu) y a la Asociación Campesina de San José de Apartadó (Acasa).

Por ello, con conocimiento de causa, exponemos el siguiente resumen de hechos:

- El 28 de enero de 2017 fue secuestrado y posteriormente asesinado Porfirio Jaramillo Bogallo, reclamante de tierras de la vereda Buenos Aires de Turbo[1].

- El 19 de marzo se reportaron amenazas de muerte contra Wilson David Quiroz y Katerine Lazo Barbosa, reclamantes de la Vereda Buenos Aires[2].

- El 19 de agosto de 2017 fue asesinado el joven Jesús Alberto Sánchez, hijo de reclamantes de tierras, cuya familia fue desplazada por hechos violentos en el año 2016 de la vereda Guacamayas[3].

- El 21 de agosto de 2017 se reportó un intento de homicidio a la joven Arley Carupia, indígena de 18 años, nieta de Alicia Carupia Domicó a quien el Estado colombiano le restituyó el predio Mi Bohío en Urabá[4].

- El domingo 1 de octubre de 2017 dos reclamantes de tierras de los corregimientos Macondo y Cuchillo Negro en el municipio de Turbo, fueron interceptados y golpeados por un grupo de hombres[5].

- El 26 de noviembre de 2017 ocurrió el asesinato de Mario Castaño, líder de la Zona de Biodiversidad Árbol del Pan perteneciente al territorio colectivo de La Larga Tumaradó[6].

- 8 de diciembre de 2017 fue asesinado Hernán Bedoya en el sector de Playa Roja que hace parte del territorio colectivo de Pedeguita y Mancilla[7].

- El día lunes 11 de diciembre de 2017 hombres encapuchados que se transportaban en moto llegaron a la casa del reclamante Manuel Oviedo, a quien meses atrás le había sido retirado el esquema de seguridad asignado por la Unidad Nacional de Protección.

- El día 12 de diciembre fue amenazado vía telefónica en Belén de Bajirá el líder reclamante de tierras de la Asociación Tierra y Paz de Urabá, Carlos Yamil Páez Díaz, quien ha sido uno de los líderes más destacado de la región en la lucha por la restitución de las tierras y por el retorno sostenible con reparación integral. Y quien además es precandidato a las circunscripciones especiales de paz.

- El día 19 de diciembre el reclamante Juan Viloria, que había retornado al sector de Cuchillo Negro en Turbo, recibió amenazas de muerte por vía telefónica en las cuales le manifestaban que debía abandonar el lugar, lo que generó su desplazamiento del territorio. Viloria había sido víctima de la golpiza ocurrida el 1 de octubre.

- Finalmente hay que decir que, como ha ocurrido en años anteriores, el corregimiento San José de Apartadó sigue siendo un territorio afectado por la vulneración de derechos humanos por parte de actores armados ilegales. Paradójicamente luego de que saliera de la zona el Quinto Frente de las FARC, no hubo una mejoría en las condiciones de vida para las comunidades. Por el contrario se hicieron evidentes los comportamientos negligentes por parte de la Gobernación de Antioquia y de la Alcaldía de Apartadó para con las preocupaciones y denuncias de la comunidad, y se hizo notable el control territorial por parte de las Autodefensas Gaitanistas en más veredas del corregimiento, lo mismo que el reclutamiento de jóvenes con las promesas de ingresos[8].

- Los grupos agresores y de Autodefensa prohíben a los campesinos hacer uso en los territorios, de los esquemas de protección brindados a algunos líderes por parte de la Unidad Nacional de Protección UNP lo que neutraliza dichos esquemas y demanda  a la UNP el rediseño de los esquemas de protección

**Contexto:**

Es un hecho que los territorios abandonados por las FARC no están siendo copados por el Estado colombiano y por el contrario vienen siendo controlados por actores ilegales de corte neoparamilitar así como por el ELN.  Las dinámicas de control ilegal del territorio son reforzadas por la coincidencia de intereses de empresarios bananeros, palmeros, ganaderos y narcos, en cuanto a no permitir la consolidación de la soberanía comunitaria en el territorio.

En este sentido se debe advertir que las actuaciones de la Fuerza Pública no son transparentes en todo el territorio nacional y en muchos de estos territorios los pobladores dan testimonio de la connivencia y complacencia con los ilegales. Una prueba de ellos es la expansión de la estructura de base paramilitar denominada “Puntos”. La “estructura de puntos”, que ya es ampliamente conocida en el Urabá antioqueño, ejerce el control ilegal del territorio. Los puntos cuentan al menos con una persona dotada de teléfono celular; un medio de transporte, casi siempre  motocicletas; y dinero en efectivo. Realizan labores de vigilancia e inteligencia sobre la cotidianidad de las comunidades.

Así, los paramilitares han extendido una red de informantes y vigilantes que solo entre el Bajo Atrato chocoano y el Urabá antioqueño se han logrado detectar 49 “puntos”. Dicha estrategia es funcional a las dinámicas de control social y territorial establecida por el paramilitarismo que ha estrechado lazos con algunos empresarios y narcotraficantes de la región, como lo demuestra la incautación de 13,4 toneladas de cocaína pertenecientes a las AGC en cuatro fincas bananeras ubicadas en los municipios de Chigorodó y Carepa. Aunque dicha incautación fue hecha por la Policía y el Ejército el pasado 9 de noviembre, a la fecha no han trascendido las investigaciones sobre los empresarios bananeros en cuyas propiedades estaba escondido este cargamento de drogas.

De otra parte, es un hecho que las instituciones en el orden territorial no responden, ni de manera preventiva ni en el ciclo de atención. Todas las instituciones, desde la Defensoría del Pueblo hasta la Alta Consejería para los Derechos Humanos, la Unidad para la Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas, y la Unidad de Restitución de Tierras;  hablan de la activación de rutas y protocolos para las familias afectadas, los cuales finalmente no significan ningún alivio a la situación vivida[9]. El caso de las Personerías como primera instancia local en materia de derechos humanos es lamentable. Por lo general los personeros asisten solo cuando desde las alcaldías son convocados a reuniones y no mantienen ninguna línea rápida de respuesta al ciudadano o ciudadana. Para los alcaldes es una institución incómoda, por ello no la tienen en primera línea de atención. Por el contrario los inspectores de policía, como el inspector de Currulao, juegan un papel central en el hostigamiento a los campesinos reclamantes con las amenazas de desalojos.

En cuanto a la Fiscalía, en la región esta institución judicial ha sido señalada por las víctimas de desestimar sus denuncias e incluso de filtrarlas a actores ilegales. Esto se complejiza más si se tiene en cuenta que, a nivel nacional, la Fiscalía General de la Nación se ha negado a reconocer la sistematicidad de las agresiones y asesinatos contra líderes sociales y defensores de derechos humanos, lo cual también ha hecho el Ministerio de Defensa. La situación refleja una notable falta de consenso con otras instituciones del Gobierno y el Estado colombiano como el Ministerio del Interior y la Procuraduría General de la Nación que han pedido investigar las agresiones contra líderes sociales.

Para complejizar más el asunto, el incumplimiento a las órdenes de los magistrados y los jueces es la norma en el Urabá, de eso han dado cuenta tanto las Audiencias de seguimiento realizadas por los magistrados de restitución de tierras como el seguimiento a los Autos y fallos en materia de medidas cautelares, por ejemplo, al territorio colectivo de la Larga Tumaradó por parte del Juez Primero de Restitución de Tierras de Quibdó.

Así mismo, es importante anotar que en Urabá no hay una cultura institucional de respeto a los derechos humanos y tampoco de respuesta favorable a los campesinos. Por el contrario hay una postura hostil hacia éstos y hacia las organizaciones que acompañamos a las comunidades.

En este contexto se debe denunciar que:

1. Existe un movimiento muy organizado contra la restitución de tierras, el cual cuenta con varias fundaciones, una de ellas es Paz y Futuro cuyos miembros se declaran abiertamente como víctimas de la restitución de tierras. Dicha organización es muy activa públicamente señalando a las organizaciones de reclamantes de ser falsas víctimas. Al respecto la Unidad de Restitución de Tierras no desarrolla ninguna campaña en la opinión pública ni a nivel educativo en pro de las organizaciones de reclamantes de tierras. Las actividades de esta fundación se presentan cuando los jueces van a hacer entrega material de los bienes restituidos. Un caso emblemático ocurrió recientemente en Bejuquillo donde un grupo de persona se opuso a la entrega material del bien

2. Cuando se dan capturas de empresarios ligados al despojo de tierras, los campesinos dicen que generalmente mejora el contexto en el territorio y disminuyen las agresiones que suelen consistir en asesinatos, amenazas de muerte, desalojos, palizas, quema de cultivos y de viviendas, envenenamiento de animales y de aguas, Invasión de búfalos, etc.

3. En las cabeceras urbanas del Eje Bananero hay más solidaridad con el “Clan del Golfo” que con los campesinos.

**Por ello, en vista de lo anterior, hacemos las siguientes propuestas[10]:**

1. Exigir que se aceleren los procesos de restitución de tierras, individuales y colectivos, en todo el territorio.

2. Exigir que la Agencia Nacional de Tierras cumpla la promesa realizada directamente por su director Miguel Samper en el mes de mayo de 2017 de emprender un proceso piloto de titulación y formalización de predios en San José de Apartadó y que de manera irresponsable olvidó tan pronto regresó a Bogotá sin tener la consideración de atender las comunicaciones con la comunidad.

3. Exigir la implementación de los PDET’s[11] en todo el territorio con claras estrategias hacia la restitución de los predios.

4. Solicitar una Misión especial de la Fiscalía General de la Nación que sea dirigida desde Bogotá, para que adelante una investigación y presente un informe esclarecedor sobre los responsables de estos hechos, como base para sancionar a los responsables intelectuales y materiales de las múltiples violaciones de derechos humanos en Urabá y Bajo Atrato a reclamantes de tierras individuales y colectivos.

5. Investigación de responsabilidades de la fuerza pública de Urabá y Bajo Atrato por acción u omisión en las múltiples agresiones. Con informe de medidas correctivas a las comunidades.

6. Medidas especiales desde la Unidad para la Atención y Reparación a las Victimas -Uariv y desde la Unidad de Restitución de Tierras -URT que les dé estatus de Sujetos de Reparación Colectiva a las organizaciones y territorios que realizan demandas de restitución de tierras.

7. Destacamentos del Ejército de manera permanente en la ruta geoestratégica de “Puntos Paramilitares”, y un cuerpo especial de la Policía para controles a rutas de movilidad de los ilegales. Combinada con una aceleración en la presencia social del Estado para superar el Estado de solo militarización del territorio

8. Investigación especial de la Fiscalía sobre responsabilidad de empresarios ganaderos, palmeros, bananeros y empresarios de infraestructura e inmobiliarias en el sistema de agresiones a campesinos y reclamantes.

9. A la Procuraduría General de la Nación solicitar investigación y sanción de todo el sistema de funcionarios públicos que son negligentes o conniventes con las agresiones: alcaldes, directores (as) de la Unidad de atención y reparación a las víctimas – Uariv y la Unidad para la Restitución de Tierras -URT, personeros, inspectores de policía , funcionarios del CTI, la Fiscalía, la Dirección de Investigación Criminal -Dijín y la Seccional de Investigación Criminal- Sijín, etc.

10. Acompañamientos de Comunidad Internacional tipo Brigadas Internacionales de Paz -PBI en el Urabá y Bajo Atrato.

11. Realización de campañas educativas y mediáticas por parte de los gobiernos nacional, departamental y municipal;  que contribuyan a valorar la labor de las y los líderes campesinos (as)  y de restitución de tierras, y de las organizaciones que acompañan. Así mismo, presencia en el territorio del cuerpo diplomático y labores de seguimiento de la oficina de la ONU en Colombia, con informes sobre la situación de los reclamantes de tierras individuales y colectivas, con carácter periódico y exigencias al gobierno en materia de protección y garantías.",269,"Spanish"

Con la incorporación, aumenta la flota vehicular de la institución en beneficio de la población vulnerable a daños y pérdidas generados por eventos adversos en todo el país.

El acto de donación fue desarrollado en la sede de la Secretaría, con la participación del ministro de la SEN, Joaquín Roa Burgos, miembros de su gabinete y funcionarios de la misión diplomática del país asiático. En la ocasión, Roa agradeció la donación y apuntó que la República de China-Taiwán es una de las cooperaciones que más aportes ha venido entregando a la institución en materia de ayuda humanitaria.

Recordó las ayudas recibidas previamente, consistentes en módulos flotantes para el armado de muelles, puentes, etc., una donación de arroz que representó un ahorro de aproximadamente mil millones de guaraníes, “que fueron redireccionados a otras ayudas humanitarias”, entre otros. Destacó igualmente que ya está en proceso una nueva donación, consistente en 500 toneladas de arroz.

“A meses de financiar la administración del presidente Cartes y la mía, quiero agradecerle con el corazón en la mano, en nombre del pueblo paraguayo. Ahora estamos aumentando la flota de móviles de la SEN”, expresó el titular de esta cartera de Estado. Roa agregó que hace cuatro años no se contaba con ningún camión, pero que “ahora la institución está fortalecida para que el Gobierno continúe mejorando sus acciones”.

Por su parte, el embajador de China-Taiwán comentó que todas las donaciones que se han realizado a la SEN fueron utilizadas de una manera eficaz y siempre dieron buenos resultados. “Esta donación no es una cuestión de azar; se trabaja muy bien con ustedes. Todos los proyectos que hemos colaborado con ustedes siempre dan resultado”, aseguró.

Con esta entrega, la SEN pasa a contar con 16 camiones dentro de su flota vehicular: 10 con capacidad de carga de 10 000 kilos; el nuevo camión, con 9 000 kg de capacidad de carga y otros cinco con 8 000 kg. En suma, la capacidad de arrastre de la institución es de unos 150 000 kg, para el transporte de insumos de ayuda humanitaria en todo el país.",269,"Spanish"

Mediante un simbólico viaje en barco de tres días, lograron llegar al puerto de sus metas y a la forma de lograrlas.**

GIRARDOT

El viaje simbólico de las 95 personas asistentes al II Encuentro De Tu Mano para un Mejor Futuro comenzó en el registro, al ingreso del evento, cuando recibieron un maletín rojo con una agenda y un botón. Sin tener el horizonte claro, empezaron el recorrido que los llevaría a aclarar sus sueños y metas, así como la manera de concretarlos desde el presente.

Las víctimas del conflicto armado que participaron en el Encuentro tenían entre 20 y 50 años y se habían graduado de estudios superiores hace poco tiempo gracias a la estrategia De TU Mano para un Mejor Futuro, en distintas zonas del país. Cuando llegaron al Centro Lagomar El Peñón de Girardot, no entendían bien de qué se trataba el taller de tres días, para el que viajaron en avión desde sus ciudades y luego por tierra durante tres horas desde Bogotá.

Pero empezaron a comprenderlo cuando los talleristas y monitores, vestidos de marineros, les fueron explicando cómo podrían lograr una mejor vida personal y profesional. Los maletines se fueron llenando de simbolismos como una brújula para buscar soluciones y una lupa para ver bien los problemas, pero también de formatos sobre cómo gestionar proyectos creativos y así ser emprendedores, o cómo hacer una buena Hoja de Vida si lo que quieren es ser empleados.

Liliana García Tobón se graduó en Derecho en Medellín, gracias a que fue seleccionada por la Unidad para las Víctimas, entre los 600 mejores estudiantes de Antioquia, y por ser a la vez víctima del conflicto armado en el municipio de Granada del departamento. Ella terminó su carrera en 2016 y relata emocionada cómo se siente hoy después de haber terminado sus estudios sin tener que pagar nada: “hoy pasé de ser víctima a trabajar con victimarios porque trabajo con desmovilizados, que pudieron haber sido los causantes de mucho dolor par mi familia.

Ahora sé que yo puedo hacer mucho ante la sociedad”. Liliana dice sorprendida “no sé qué hice para merecer tanto, este taller ha sido superemocionante, me imaginaba algo totalmente diferente, nos han tratado muy bien”. Emocionados estuvieron todos los participantes en cada etapa del taller que era como una metáfora de lo que podrían enfrentar en la vida. Cuando no sabían qué iba a pasar, cuando enfrentaban tempestades y se fortalecían con ello, cuando buscaban y encontraban soluciones y cuando, ya en el puerto, veían un horizonte claro, unas metas y la forma de empezar a concretarlas en el presente.

Fueron tres días en los que aprendieron a vencer sus miedos, a empoderarse y sentirse capaces de ser emprendedores, o a identificar cómo mejorar la elaboración de hojas de vida y su participación en entrevistas de trabajo. Mediante juegos de roles y otras prácticas identificaron sus fortalezas, sus logros y se comprometieron con la construcción de un mejor futuro para cada quien y para la sociedad.

En la noche de este miércoles, al final de taller, hubo una especial noche blanca simbólica en la playa del Centro Lagomar El Peñón, en la que en un círculo hecho en la arena ubicaron los Mandalas que hicieron durante tres días, que constaban de tres partes: una sobre el pasado, con sus conocimientos y recursos; otra sobre el futuro que desean; y una más con el presente en el cual pueden dar los primeros pasos hacia ese futuro.

Durante la ceremonia de cierre las 95 personas recibieron certificados de participación en el Encuentro y cada uno, en grupos de 8 o 9, expresó su compromiso con su presente y su futuro y el convencimiento de poder comenzar con entusiasmo la nueva etapa que como profesionales se abre en sus vidas.",269,"Spanish"
2390284,"Un día distinto vivieron excombatientes de FARC y sus familias en su proceso de reincorporación Por primera vez, un grupo de 90 reincorporados de las FARC con sus familias pudieron tener una jornada lúdica y recreativa, promovida por la Alcaldía de Medellín –A través del Grupo Territorial Paz y Reconciliación-, la Agencia para la Reincorporación y la Normalización –ARN- y el acompañamiento de la Misión de Verificación de la ONU.

A las 9:00 de la mañana, cuando abrieron las puertas del Parque de las Aguas, una algarabía se formó en la entrada. Eran 90 reincorporados de las Farc con sus familias, quienes por primera vez disfrutarían de una jornada en un espacio recreativo público, como parte de su proceso de reincorporación a la vida civil, en la legalidad.

A esa hora ingresaron al sitio, ubicado en el municipio de Barbosa, en el norte del área metropolitana de Medellín, más de 2.000 personas, la mayoría pertenecían a familias y grupos de jóvenes y niños de los barrios populares de la capital antioqueña, quienes al igual que los ex guerrilleros de las Farc se preparaban para un día de sol, toboganes y piscinas.

“Nunca me imaginé este momento. No veo a mi hijo desde hace más de 3 años y pude traerlo aquí. Acá entramos y nadie nos miró extraño. Uno se siente común y corriente y ahora esperamos aportarle a la sociedad”, dice Janeth, ex guerrillera de las Farc, mientras abraza a su hijo que no para de brincar en la piscina. 

Esta iniciativa fue liderada por la Alcaldía de Medellín, a través del Grupo Territorial Paz y Reconciliación adscrito a la Secretaría de Seguridad y la Agencia para la Reincorporación y la Normalización –ARN- del Gobierno nacional, con el propósito de afianzar el acercamiento de los reincorporados y sus familias y brindar un espacio lúdico y recreativo.

“Una reincorporación debe ser integral e incluir programas de recreación y deportes. Estamos convencidos de la importancia de garantizar el goce efectivo de los derechos de estas personas que poco a poco empiezan a disfrutar espacios cotidianos en la sociedad”, expresó Juan de Dios Graciano, asesor designado para la coordinación del grupo territorial Paz y Reconciliación de la Alcaldía de Medellín.

Graciano precisó que espacios como estos seguirán replicándose en varios escenarios con distintos contenidos y en diferentes modalidades, todos con un enfoque incluyente.

Para varios de los reincorporados de las Farc acceder a estos lugares parecía imposible en el pasado. “Algunos de nosotros ni conocíamos una piscina. Siempre estuvimos en el campo y no tuvimos mucho conocimiento de cómo era la ciudad. Por ejemplo, yo ahora, ya mayor, apenas voy a validar el bachillerato”, dice uno de ellos.

Víctor Luna, exdirector técnico del Deportivo Independiente Medellín y actual coordinador del programa Deporte, Convivencia y Paz de la Alcaldía municipal, considera que es importante darle una mano a personas que están dando este paso de reincorporación a la sociedad. “Esto es una experiencia enorme porque me encuentro con personas con muchas expectativas, veo sus miradas y siento que tenemos que apoyar este camino a la reconciliación en un paso grande que estamos dando. Es importante generarles confianza y comenzar a pensar una proyección sólida”, expresó.

La jornada lúdica se extendió hasta las 3:30 de la tarde en un ambiente de convivencia que esperan poder replicar la Alcaldía y ARN el próximo año.",269,"Spanish"
2390269,"Honduras: Expertos condenan medidas contra manifestantes y prensa 20 de diciembre de 2017

WASHINGTON D.C / GINEBRA. - Expertos* de la ONU y la CIDH condenaron el asesinato de al menos 12 manifestantes en Honduras y la detención de cientos de personas que tomaron las calles luego de la suspensión del conteo de votos de las elecciones presidenciales del mes pasado.

El Gobierno declaró un estado de emergencia, suspendiendo derechos fundamentales, después de que miles de personas se sumaron a las manifestaciones en rechazo a las irregularidades del proceso electoral del 26 de noviembre. La policía detuvo forzosamente las protestas. El estado de emergencia quedó sin efecto el pasado 9 de diciembre.

""Exhortamos al Gobierno de Honduras a dar cumplimiento estricto a sus obligaciones de respetar y garantizar los derechos a la vida, así como los derechos a la libertad de expresión y derecho de reunión de todas las personas bajo su jurisdicción"", afirmaron les expertos. Los expertos notaron que la proclamación de estados de excepción no autoriza, bajo ninguna circunstancia, la derogación de derechos a la vida e integridad personal y llamaron a las autoridades a investigar estos hechos.

""Las protestas callejeras y los disturbios no constituyen una situación excepcional que justifique per se la suspensión de derechos fundamentales"", afirmaron los expertos. ""Por el contrario, en momentos críticos para la vigencia de la democracia, el debate público robusto y las manifestaciones políticas deben tener la máxima protección posible"", manifestaron.

""Estamos alarmados por el uso ilegal y excesivo de la fuerza para disolver protestas, que resultó en la muerte de al menos 12 manifestantes, decenas de heridos y cientos de detenidos, muchas de ellos trasladados a instalaciones militares, donde habrían sido brutalmente golpeados, insultados y sometidos a torturas, y otros tratos crueles inhumanos y degradantes"".  

Asimismo durante este tiempo, se han reportado ataques y detenciones de periodistas durante la cobertura de protestas. Los días 9 y 10 de diciembre, Radio Progreso, un medio comunitario emblemático por su independencia y defensa de la democracia, denunció el sabotaje de su torre y antena en Tegucigalpa. La radio perdió su señal en la zona central del país.

""Hacemos un llamado urgente para que se investigue el ataque a Radio Progreso, se restablezca su transmisión y se garantice la seguridad de sus periodistas y trabajadores"", reafirmaron.

""Antes, durante y después de contiendas electorales, la información pública sobre el proceso electoral, divulgada de manera oportuna, proactiva y fidedigna, es una garantía indispensable de los sistemas democráticos"", concluyeron.

2389364,"Evaluación del impacto socioeconómico de las inversiones en prevención y reducción de riesgos: El caso de Tabasco **RESUMEN EJECUTIVO**

En este estudio, se evalúa el rol de las inversiones en prevención y reducción de riesgos de desastres (RRD) en la reducción del impacto de las inundaciones en el estado de Tabasco entre los años 2007 y 2010.  
Sobre la base de un estudio previo realizado en el marco de un Acuerdo de Asistencia Técnica entre el Gobierno de México y el Banco Mundial, se determinó que los eventos de intensas lluvias en Tabasco en 2007 y 2010 fueron similares en términos de características hidrometeorológicas (precipitación) y de distribución espacial (manchas de precipitación). Al analizar el nivel de precipitación acumulada registrado en ambos eventos, se encontró que la inundación de 2010 tuvo una magnitud superior a la de 2007. Sin embargo, las estimaciones de daños y pérdidas registradas por el Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres (CENAPRED) muestran una reducción del 80 % en 2010 respecto de 2007 (Banco Mundial, 2014). La similitud en estos eventos presenta un escenario ideal de “experimento natural” para evaluar los beneficios de las inversiones en RRD realizadas entre 2008 y 2010.  
A raíz de las devastadoras inundaciones en octubre de 2007, el Gobierno Federal, junto con el Gobierno del Estado de Tabasco, diseñaron y comenzaron la implementación del Plan Hídrico Integral de Tabasco (PHIT). El PHIT tiene por objetivo generar un conjunto de soluciones que garanticen la seguridad de la población, así como el desempeño y la continuidad de las actividades económicas, y el equilibrio en los ecosistemas ante la incidencia de inundaciones. El PHIT contempla la implementación de medidas estructurales (inversiones físicas como bordos y reforzamientos) y no estructurales (iniciativas no ingenieriles como talleres, capacitaciones, desarrollo de sistemas de alerta temprana y trazado de mapas de riesgo, entre otros). Como parte del PHIT, se invirtieron un total de USD 753 613 871 (MXN 9518 millones)1 en medidas de RRD entre 2008 y 2010, equivalente al 2,18 % del PIB del estado en 2010. Aproximadamente el 84 % de estos recursos se invirtieron en infraestructura de protección de la población y de áreas productivas (56 % de la inversión total), así como en la reconstrucción de infraestructura hidráulica de protección (alrededor del 27 % del total) (Banco Mundial, 2014).  
El presente análisis tiene por objetivo evaluar el impacto de las inundaciones y de las inversiones en RRD en el bienestar socioeconómico de la población de Tabasco.  
Para ello, se estimó el impacto en la tasa de deserción escolar para estudiantes de Educación Básica (primaria y secundaria) y el efecto en la actividad económica del estado (medido a través del cambio en la intensidad de las luces nocturnas, conocidas en la literatura especializada por su denominación en inglés, Nighttime Lights, o por sus siglas NTL). Esto, sumado a información georreferenciada de la ubicación de las inversiones en RRD y el nivel de inundación (estimado mediante el modelo de inundación fluvial GLOFRIS) presente durante cada uno de los eventos, permitió obtener estimaciones con un nivel de desagregación espacial de 1 km2 .  
Los resultados, por una parte, muestran que el nivel de inundación fluvial (GLOFRIS) en efecto tiene un impacto negativo en la deserción escolar y en el cambio en las NTL. Específicamente, se observa un mayor impacto negativo en 2007 que en 2010, año en el que este se controla por la presencia de inversiones de protección.  
En 2007, se encontró que 1 dm de inundación adicional generó un incremento en la tasa de deserción escolar en casi un 0,1 %, mientras que el impacto en 2010 fue de tan solo el 0,023 %. De igual manera, las NTL muestran una reducción del 30 % en la intensidad de la luz después de la inundación de 2007, en comparación con un 5,4 % en 2010.  
Por otra parte, no se encontraron resultados robustos para medir el efecto de las inversiones en RRD, aun después de corregir un posible sesgo derivado de la ubicación de estas. Consideramos que la falta de información sobre la extensión precisa de las inversiones, así como problemas en la temporalidad de los datos de deserción escolar y la falta de información de NTL para los meses precedentes a la inundación de 2010, pueden ser la causa de la falta de precisión en nuestras estimaciones.  
En conclusión, los resultados obtenidos en este estudio refuerzan los encontrados en el estudio anterior (Banco Mundial, 2014): el impacto de la inundación de 2007 fue superior al de la inundación de 2010, aun cuando 2010 se caracterizó por lluvias de mayor magnitud. En cuanto a las inversiones en RRD, se requiere una mayor precisión temporal y espacial para analizar impacto de estas.",269,"Spanish"

2388284,"Aumenta la pobreza en América Latina, revela Comisión Económica para América Latina y Caribe 21 de diciembre, 2017 — Después de más de una década de reducción en la mayoría de los países, los niveles de pobreza y pobreza extrema aumentaron en América Latina en 2015 y 2016. Eso fue el hallazgo del informe Panorama Social de América Latina 2017 presentado el miércoles por Alicia Bárcena, Secretaria Ejecutiva de la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL), en conferencia de prensa en las oficinas del organismo en la Ciudad de México.

La agencia de la ONU presentó su estudio comparativo de las situaciones sociales en los país de América Latina, con un enfoque en los sistemas de pensiones, y llamó a fortalecer las políticas laborales y de protección social universales, solidarios y sostenible en la región.

mientras que en 2017 se mantendrían estables, 186 millones de personas se encuentran en situación de pobreza en la región, informó la CEPAL, lo que representa 30.7 % de la población, un aumento de 1% en comparación con el año previo.

De manera igual, la pobreza extrema llegó al 10% en 2016 (61 millones de personas), un crecimiento de 2% en comparación con 2014.

El Panorama Social 2017 muestra también que la incidencia de la pobreza y de la pobreza extrema es más elevada entre niños y niñas, adolescentes, jóvenes, mujeres y la población que reside en áreas rurales.

Sin embargo, una perspectiva de mediano plazo arroja un balance positivo en materia de reducción de la pobreza, ya que esta se redujo 15,2 puntos porcentuales entre 2002 y 2016, subrayó la Sra. Bárcena.

La desigualdad de ingresos también se redujo entre 2002 y 2016, aunque el ritmo de caída ha disminuido en los últimos años.

“La experiencia reciente nos indica que el aumento de los ingresos en los hogares de menores recursos ha sido imprescindible para la reducción tanto de la pobreza como de la desigualdad de ingresos” sostuvo Bárcena.

“Y a ese crecimiento han contribuido decisivamente las políticas distributivas y redistributivas de los países, como reformas tributarias, salarios mínimos, pensiones y transferencias vinculadas a las estrategias de reducción de la pobreza y a la expansión de los sistemas de protección social”, añadió.

El informe publicado hoy por la CEPAL también analiza la evolución y los desafíos de los sistemas de pensiones, que son fundamentales para la garantía de los derechos a la seguridad social y a la protección social de la región en un contexto de cambios demográficos acelerados.

Se estima que en 2040 las personas de 60 años y más superarán a las de 0 a 14, y que la población de 80 años y más aumentará casi 20 millones para esa fecha. También se observa una tendencia a la feminización de la población adulta mayor.

Aunque se amplió entre 2000 y 2014 la contribución a los sistemas de pensiones en América Latina, se estima que 142 millones de personas económicamente activas aún no están cubiertas. Además, el informe destaca que las prestaciones queden en amplia medida insuficientes.

De acuerdo con el estudio, las reformas implementadas entre 2008 y 2017 en la región evidencian una nueva tendencia, con un denominador común: avanzan en el desarrollo de mecanismos de solidaridad y, en la mayoría de ellas, aumenta la participación del Estado.

El estudio concluye afirmando que la consolidación de sistemas de pensiones universales, solidarios y sostenibles es un objetivo posible y necesario en un pacto social para el desarrollo con igualdad.

Por ello, “el llamado es a fortalecer las políticas laborales y de protección social, más aún en períodos de bajo crecimiento económico, y a implementar la Agenda 2030 para el Desarrollo Sostenible a partir de un cambio estructural progresivo”, concluyó la alta funcionaria de las Naciones Unidas.

2388269,"Boletín 48 DIGEPI registra importante baja incidencia de enfermedades de transmisión vectorial **SANTO DOMINGO**.- La Dirección General de Epidemiologia (DIGEPI) del Ministerio de Salud informó en su boletín correspondiente a la Semana Epidemiológica (SE) número 48, que enfermedades como dengue, cólera, malaria, leptospirosis y enfermedad meningocócica continúan tendencia a la baja en comparación con el mismo periodo del pasado año.

La publicación notifica una reducción en la incidencia del dengue en comparación con 2016. Entre las SE 1-48 del 2016, se notificaron 6 mil 482 casos probables de dengue con 40 defunciones. Mientras, para igual período del cursante 2017se han reportado 1 mil 281 casos, es decir 5 mil 201 casos menos que el año pasado y solo una defunción.

En tanto, sobre el cólera los reportes de 2016 registraron una reducción de 1 mil 019 casos al registrar sólo 114 casos en 2017, en comparación con los 1 mil 133 casos de 2016. En cuanto a mortalidad, ésta se redujo en 90 por ciento al pasar de 27 defunciones en 2016 a sólo 4 defuncioneshasta la semana 48.

Mientras, con respecto a la malaria se notifican 664 casos en 2016 hasta la semana 48 (2 fallecidos) y en 2017 se registran 380 (1 fallecido), para una reducción de 284 casos en el todo el país. Se recuerda que por tercera vez en los últimos 5 años la República Dominicana recibió recientemente de la Organización Mundial y Panamericana de la Salud (OMS/OPS) el reconocimiento de campeón de la lucha contra la malaria en las Américas.

Todos estos resultados coinciden con la aplicación de medidas de prevención y combate a los mosquitos a través de jornadas permanentes de eliminación de criaderos que ejecutan de manera sistemáticas las Direcciones Provinciales y de Áreas de Salud (DPS/DAS) con la colaboración de organizaciones comunitarias, instituciones privadas y estatales.

De enfermedades como polio, rubeola y sarampión no se reportan casos en 2016 ni 2017, en tanto que la difteria, tétanos y tosferina se mantienen en el rango de valores esperados.

**Leptospirosis**

En el caso de la leptospirosis  para la SE 48 de 2016 se habían reportado 572  casos  y 58 muertes al 2017, para la misma semana se han registrado 726 para un aumento de 156 casos, con 72 defunciones.Este incremento se produce en el marco de dos importantes fenómenos hidrometeorológicos que trajeron consigo dos grandes inundaciones en zonas vulnerables. 

Se estima que las condiciones derivadas del huracán María, José e Irma y las constantes lluvias que afectaron el territorio nacional durante los últimos meses provocaron un aumento de la letalidad por leptospirosis (7.73 veces) en comparación al mismo período del pasado año.

**Enfermedades zoonóticas**

En tanto, respecto a las enfermedades zoonóticas o trasmitidas por animales, incluida la rabia humana, en 2016 no hubo casos. Durante el cursante 2017 se registró un caso, el cual se convirtió en el número 17 a nivel mundial que sobrevive a la enfermedad.

El Ministerio continúa  su exhortación a la población a mantener las medidas de prevención de la leptospirosis y otras enfermedades; y emite a los ciudadanos la necesidad de evitar desplazarse en lodo, aguas sucias estancadas; lavarse bien las manos con agua y jabón, lavar los envases de alimentos enlatados antes destaparlos.

**Mortalidad materna e infantil**

En ambos renglones DGEPI reportó en el boletín correspondiente a la semana 48,  un aumento con relación al anterior, lo que ocupa la atención de las autoridades, las cuales realizan las auditorías necesarias para la establecer las respuestas correspondientes en la red de servicios y llevar las orientaciones pertinentes al control de los embarazos en las comunidades.

*Avanza el proceso de reparación colectiva de la comunidad de Bellavista, corregimiento del municipio de Algarrobo, como medida de restitución que busca mejorar las condiciones socioeconómicas de las familias con la entrega material de bienes.*

**SANTA MARTA**

La Unidad para las Víctimas entregó a la comunidad del corregimiento Bellavista un banco de maquinaria agrícola consistente en un tractor con todos sus implementos -corta malezas, rastra preparadora, arado de cincel vibratorio y remolque multiusos-, ideal para la utilización en actividades relacionadas con la vocación agrícola y pecuaria de esta zona del municipio de Algarrobo, Magdalena.

La entrega fue hecha en el marco del Plan Integral de Reparación Colectiva (PIRC) de la comunidad de Bellavista, como resultado de la medida de restitución denominada “Implementación de proyectos productivos y de generación de ingresos”.

El director territorial de la Unidad en el departamento de Magdalena, Carlos Ortiz Ruiz, entregó los bienes a la Junta de Acción Comunal del corregimiento para la administración de los mismos.

El objetivo es beneficiar a más de cien familias pertenecientes a esta comunidad para contribuir a resarcir los daños económicos y sociales que les generó el conflicto armado. El 80% de los miembros de esta población se beneficia en forma directa, aunque el impacto se refleja en toda la región.

El banco de maquinaria pudo ser entregado a la comunidad gracias a la articulación desarrollada durante el 2017 entre la Unidad para las Víctimas, la Alcaldía de Algarrobo y el Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (SENA), que permitió cumplir la meta de cerrar esta medida de restitución para favorecer a familias afectadas por el conflicto armado.

La administración municipal de Algarrobo, hace algunas semanas, hizo entrega de semillas e insumos a los agricultores de esta comunidad y el SENA formó e instruyó a los campesinos en emprendimiento y en el manejo de cultivos agrícolas.

“Este año la gestión de la Unidad para las Víctimas para avanzar en la implementación del PIRC de Bellavista, se enfocó en la reactivación de la economía”, señaló Jorge Luis Medina, presidente de la Junta de Acción Comunal del corregimiento, al referirse a los que consideró más importante dentro del proceso de reparación colectiva.

El director territorial de la Unidad en Magdalena, Carlos Ortiz Ruiz, resaltó la importancia del trabajo articulado con la Alcaldía Municipal de Algarrobo y otras instituciones que, además, permitió el avance de otras iniciativas diseñadas para la restitución, como la construcción de la Plaza de Mercado Público de Bellavista.

La Plaza no solo ayudará a reactivar la oferta y demanda de productos en la región, también tendrá un impacto positivo en el imaginario de las personas y en la reconstrucción del tejido social, puesto que es un espacio para los encuentros comunitarios que se habían perdido por el desplazamiento que ocasionó el conflicto armado.",269,"Spanish"

2388239,"Colombia se prepara para la temporada seca y trabaja en prevención para estas vacaciones El Director General de la Unidad Nacional para la Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres, Carlos Iván Márquez Pérez,  presentó en rueda de prensa llevada a cabo hoy en las instalaciones de la UNGRD, el balance de la segunda temporada de lluvias, plan de contingencia para la temporada seca y recomendaciones para Navidad y vacaciones.

Frente a la segunda temporada de lluvias, Márquez Pérez manifestó que se presentaron 280 eventos entre inundaciones, vendavales, deslizamientos y crecientes súbitas durante el 15 de septiembre al 15 de diciembre, dejando una afectación de 17.649 familias, 2.644 viviendas, 14 puentes vehiculares, 17 puentes peatonales, 19 acueductos, 190 viviendas destruidas y 19  personas fallecidas; principalmente en los departamentos de Cauca, Bolívar, Antioquia, Magdalena y Chocó.
 
Durante dicha temporada, el Sistema Nacional de Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres- SNGRD brindó una respuesta oportuna complementando las capacidades locales y regionales mediante 300 toneladas de asistencia humanitaria de emergencia movilizadas por vía aérea, marítima, fluvial y terrestre; igualmente, 32.950 horas de maquinaria amarilla fueron empleadas para el tema de limpieza y remoción de escombros, se activaron 199 subsidios de arriendo, se repartieron más de 7 millones de litros de agua potable utilizando carrotanques y plantas potabilizadoras; también, se activaron obras de emergencias en Cauca, Magdalena, Bolívar, Antioquia y Arauca con las que se mitigó el impacto de las inundaciones, además se movilizaron 90.000 sacos de polipropileno y combos de materiales para reconstrucción; y se ha iniciado con la construcción de cuatro puentes peatonales, tres en Corinto, Cauca y uno en Filadelfia, Caldas, el cual es considerado el puente más largo en Colombia con 102 metros de largo.
 
La inversión en esta temporada en cuanto a la fase de respuesta alcanzó los 22.000 millones de pesos y adicionalmente se asignaron más de 13.000 millones para la atención y estabilización de Corinto en el Cauca.
 
“Es importante comparar esta 2da Temporada de Lluvias con la del año 2016. En cuanto a familias afectadas, en el 2017 se registraron 17.649 familias en comparación con las 87.459 en 2016, es decir, hubo una reducción del 69 %; en materia de viviendas afectadas, hubo 2.644 afectaciones en 2017 frente a las 13.928 en 2016, lo que significó una reducción del 81 %”, indicó Carlos Iván Márquez Pérez, Director de la UNGRD.
 
El trabajo del Gobierno Nacional ha hecho que Colombia sea menos vulnerable gracias  la inversión de 5.7 billones de pesos, invertidos en 5.428 obras de mitigación y reducción del riesgo, así como la instalación de 111 puntos de sistemas de alerta temprana instalados en 12 departamentos del país, lo que ha permitido mitigar el riesgo para  más de 8 millones de personas.
 
Por otra parte, y finalizada esta 2da Temporada de Lluvias el país se prepara para recibir la 1ª Temporada Seca del 2018, por lo cual desde el Gobierno Nacional en cabeza de la UNGRD se tiene un plan de contingencia que inició a mediados del mes de diciembre y se proyecta que este hasta el mes de marzo, temporada que coincide con la presencia del fenómeno La Niña el cual de acuerdo con los pronósticos será débil y de corta duración “que en medio de una temporada seca ayudará a algunas partes del país a contener el impacto de la escasez de lluvias, sin embargo el SNGRD no baja la guardia en las regiones  Caribe (Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Isla de Salamanca, La Guajira, Magdalena y Cesar), Andina (Bogotá-Cerros Orientales, Cundinamarca, Boyacá, Cauca, Nariño y los Santanderes) y Orinoquia (El Cocuy, Sierra de La Macarena) que pueden presentar mayores afectaciones en cuanto a incendios de la cobertura vegetal, heladas y desabastecimiento de agua” manifestó Márquez Pérez. 
 
En este sentido, desde el SNGRD tiene activas sus capacidades para afrontar esta Temporada Seca, entre las que se cuentan un sistema modular MAFFS II para el control de incendios forestales masivos, dos aviones Air Tractor adaptados, seis helicópteros, 32 bambi buckets, 18 centros de respuestas a incendios forestales, 71 vehículos de intervención rápida y 91 máquinas extintoras, entre otros equipos para la respuesta a incendios. En relación con la contingencia para el desabastecimiento de agua se tiene previsto 293 motobombas, 89 carrotanques, 136 plantas potabilizadoras, 1.887 tanques de almacenamiento, 122 pozas, 240 jagüeyes, 2.111 reservorios para sector agropecuario y 45 aerodesalinizadores, etc.
 
Adicionalmente, se encuentran a disposición 32.890 herramientas y equipos, 864 máquinas amarillas, 200.000 personas para la atención de la temporada, un Centro Nacional Logístico, cuatro Centros Logístico Humanitarios y 160 cuerpos de bomberos fortalecidos.
 
A la fecha se han presentado  30 incendios forestales en 12 departamentos dejando 684 hectáreas afectadas que ha requerido el desplazamiento de 117 unidades de bomberos y 28 máquinas extintoras.
 
Frente a esta temporada se recomienda a la comunidad evitar el uso de pólvora y de las quemas así como fogatas; no arrojar cigarrillos, ni fósforos; avisar a las autoridades en caso de cualquier inicio de incendio, cumplir con las restricciones de acceso a zonas forestales protegidas. En cuanto a las heladas, efecto de esta temporada, proteger cultivos y animales y hacer reservas de agua y uso racional de este recurso.
 
Así mismo las autoridades deben prohibir quemas y el uso de pólvora que puedan causar incendios forestales, generar sanciones a pirómanos. Frente a las heladas, generar medidas de protección a cultivos y animales. Garantizar que las Empresas Prestadoras de Servicios cuenten con Planes de Contingencia;  estar atentos a las alertas del IDEAM y activar los Planes de Contingencia y protocolos.
 
A los Sectores (Medio ambiente, Salud, Transporte, Industria, Comercio y Turismo, Agua y Saneamiento, Agricultura, Energético, Educación y Comunicaciones)  se les invita a activar sus planes de monitoreo y vigilancia así como los planes de contingencia sectoriales, especialmente los relacionados con servicios públicos; y  generar programas de prevención.
 
Finalmente, Márquez Pérez adicionó algunas recomendaciones frente a la campaña de la UNGRD “El Riesgo no se va de Vacaciones” en donde la mejor opción es la prevención, siguiendo las siguientes recomendaciones:
 
- En esta época, el mejor regalo es una navidad sin pólvora.

- Al desplazarse por vías acuáticas, recuerde usar chalecos salvavidas y no navegar en horas de la noche.

- Si se moviliza en moto, utilice siempre los elementos de seguridad obligatorios, no exceda límites de velocidad y circule siempre por el carril central.

- No olvide el kit completo de viaje por carretera, la revisión del vehículo, infórmese del estado de las vías (#767), use el cinturón de seguridad, evite el sobrecupo y si va a manejar, nunca consuma licor.

- Cuando use espumas de carnaval, recuerde que estos productos son envasados bajo presión y contienen  materiales que al contacto con chispas o llamas se incendian y pueden ocasionar múltiples daños.

- Cuando visite ríos, piscinas o el mar, no ingrese en estado de embriaguez, nade en zonas vigiladas y siga las recomendaciones de las autoridades.

- En eventos masivos, las entidades del SNGRD estarán atentas a responder ante cualquier situación.

2387819,"La implosión de un edificio afectado por el terremoto reanuda las demoliciones en Manabí El edificio El Almirante, en Bahía de Caráquez, provincia de Manabí, fue reducido a escombros luego de una implosión con dinamita, este miércoles 20 de diciembre del 2017. La estructura de nueve pisos fue afectada en su totalidad por el terremoto del 16 de abril del 2016 y las réplicas que se extendieron hasta el 3 de diciembre del 2017. 

Los técnicos de la empresa Tragsa, contratada por el Ministerio de Transportes y Obras Públicas (MTOP) para estas labores, consiguieron desmontar el edificio en menos de cuatro segundos. 

El operativo para dinamitarlo comenzó a las 07:00 con el cierre técnico del perímetro cercano a la ciudadela norte del barrio Julio Marín Barreiro. Agentes de la Policía, Fuerzas Armadas, Bomberos y funcionarios del Municipio del cantón Sucre participaron en este circuito de seguridad que priorizó la evacuación de personas en un área de 50 metros cuadrados. La implosión estaba prevista para las 14:00, pero debido a una falla mecánica del vehículo que movilizaba los equipos para la ejecución del derrocamiento se aplazó dos horas después. 

Para el desmontaje de El Almirante se emplearon 18 kilogramos de dinamita que se distribuyeron en 200 cargas adheridas a las diferentes bases del inmueble. Jorge Montassell, representante de Tragsa, dijo que los restos de bloques y concreto se desprendieron hacia el malecón de la playa dentro un área confinada estratégicamente para facilitar la recolección. Así, se espera retirar hasta el 23 de diciembre del 2017 los 3000 metros cúbicos de escombros de este edificio que estuvo en pie desde 1996. 

El MTOP emitió una disposición para que los plazos se cumplieran hasta esa fecha con la idea de que el turismo por Navidad y Año Nuevo no se afecte. Los escombros al momento obstaculizan el paso por la calle Ciudad de Bahía, una de las arterias estratégicas para cruzar en auto por el filo del mar. Con el derrocamiento de El Almirante ya son nueve las edificaciones completamente afectadas que se retiran de este cantón tras el terremoto de hace un año y ocho meses. En otros cuatro cantones de la provincia de Manabí también se realizarán demoliciones en este mes de diciembre y el próximo año, como parte de una última fase de desmontaje de inmuebles afectados por el terremoto.",269,"Spanish"

Este miércoles en el departamento del Atlántico, la directora de la Unidad para las Víctimas, Yolanda Pinto Afanador, instaló en Barranquilla un Encuentro con los Sujetos de Reparación Colectiva del departamento, entregó indemnizaciones a 300 víctimas y un camión destinado a un emprendimiento de víctimas, informó la entidad.

Durante su encuentro con la comunidad de Pita, vereda del municipio de Repelón, y la comunidad de la Universidad del Atlántico, ambos sujetos de reparación colectiva y víctimas del paramilitarismo que azotó la región entre los años 2000 y 2006, la funcionaria destacó que desde 2013, la entidad inició una ruta de reparación colectiva, abanderando el acompañamiento y acercamiento con estas víctimas.

Así, se trabaja en la construcción de una reparación transformadora que inició con la identificación de los derechos vulnerados y las acciones que se debían emprender para activar esquemas de atención a las víctimas. Seguido de esto, en cada comunidad se conformó un Comité de Impulso y el grupo de entrelazadores (tejedores y tejedoras), con quienes se construye el diagnóstico del daño.

En Pita, se avanzó en la elaboración de un Plan Integral de Reparación Colectiva con las medidas que la comunidad consideró necesarias, entre tanto, en la Universidad del Atlántico se está construyendo el diagnóstico del daño.

En medio del encuentro que se realizó a las afueras de la sede Atlántico de la Unidad para las Víctimas, Pinto Afanador entregó un Esquema Especial de producción agrícola a las víctimas de la comunidad de Pita en cumplimiento al Plan Integral de Reparación Colectiva de la vereda y como ejecución final de implementación de medidas.

La entrega incluyó un camión CNHR 4300 modelo 2018, adecuado con estacas y carpas, y 665 unidades de herramientas para producción agrícola, entre ellas, guadañadoras, carretas, hachas, regaderas, polisombra, palas, rastrillos, serruchos, entre otros.

“Ustedes son seres valientes y llenos de dignidad, supieron resistir a la violencia y decidieron no tomar las armas para tomar venganza. Por el contrario, están demostrándole a la sociedad que han sanado su corazón entendiendo que tenemos una gran oportunidad para construir un mejor país, porque no se hace un favor a quien perdonamos, nos lo hacemos a nosotros mismos”, expresó la directora frente a las dos comunidades víctimas de reparación colectiva.

En el evento, la directora estuvo acompañada por el Director Territorial de Atlántico, Alfredo Palencia, la Alcaldía de Repelón y la Mesa de Víctimas del municipio representada por su coordinador, Misael Castro, quien agradeció a la Unidad por toda la atención, acompañamiento y apoyo que han recibido.

“Queremos que aprovechen todas las medidas que la Unidad les ha entregado, en especial la comunidad de Pita, porque ahora tienen muchas oportunidades para ser grandes empresarios del campo y construir nuevos proyectos de vida en sus hogares”, añadió Pinto durante su discurso.

En horas de la tarde, la funcionaria llegó al hotel El Prado para instalar una Ceremonia de Indemnizaciones y Feria de Servicios dirigida a 300 víctimas del conflicto residentes en el Atlántico. El acto estuvo acompañado por el Secretario de Gobierno del distrito, Clemente Fajardo, el Gobernador encargado de Atlántico, Juan Carlos Muñiz, la directora del Fondo de Reparaciones de la Unidad, Mabel Monroy y Honorato Yaruro, Coordinador de la Mesa de Víctimas de Barranquilla.

Durante 2017, la Unidad para las Víctimas ha realizado siete (7) Ferias de Servicios para el acompañamiento al uso adecuado de los recursos, y en el marco de estas, 1.829 víctimas han recibido su indemnización durante el año, lo que equivale a una inversión total de $13.573 millones.

Con la entrega de otras 300 cartas de indemnización se sumaron $1.000 millones de pesos más las cifras de reparación a víctimas en el departamento del Atlántico.

“Hoy es uno de esos momentos que nos satisface para seguir trabajando por las víctimas, porque le estamos dando continuidad a muchos procesos en el departamento del Atlántico. Gracias por ser héroes, por resistir a la violencia sin usar la violencia, gracias por su paciencia, y perdónennos si nos hemos demorado, seguiremos haciendo todos los esfuerzos y poco a poco vamos a reparar a todas las víctimas”, añadió.

La funcionaria también visitó el municipio de Campo de la Cruz para inspeccionar una de las bodegas para la empresa ‘Granos del Atlántico’ del Proyecto Portal de Oportunidades, e hizo entrega de equipos y dotación a víctimas de Manatí, Suán y Campo de la Cruz con el objeto de brindar apoyo el restablecimiento de capacidades productivas y generación de ingresos de 250 víctimas cabezas de hogar de los 9 municipios socios del proyecto.",269,"Spanish"

**09:18. Lambayeque, dic. 21.**

Las instalaciones de diversos centros educativos rurales de Lambayeque, afectados por el Fenómeno El Niño costero, fueron inspeccionadas por un equipo técnico encabezado por el director ejecutivo del Programa Nacional de Infraestructura Educativa (Pronied), Mario Ríos Espinoza.

El titular del Pronied afirmó que los daños en los ambientes de diversos locales escolares encontrados durante las visitas inopinadas en las tres provincias de Lambayeque permitirán una mejor evaluación para incluir a los locales más afectados por el Fenómeno El Niño costero en el Plan Integral de Reconstrucción con Cambios (PIRCC).

En diálogo con los directores de los centros educativos, Ríos Espinoza reiteró la necesidad de utilizar de manera eficiente los recursos asignados para el mantenimiento de los colegios públicos, a fin de atender las demandas más urgentes de la población escolar.

La segunda inspección realizada por Pronied en la región Lambayeque permitió a los técnicos de este programa llegar hasta colegios ubicados en las zonas rurales de las tres provincias y constatar cómo es que se han invertido los recursos transferidos por este programa del Minedu a las autoridades regionales y locales.

El director ejecutivo del Pronied, Mario Ríos; el viceministro de Gestión Institucional, Henry Harman; y el gobernador de Lambayeque, Humberto Acuña, inspeccionaron las obras en el colegio militar Elías Aguirre, cuya inversión asciende a 47 millones de soles y es construido por el Gobierno Regional de Lambayeque.

Durante la supervisión se constató que las obras en el mencionado colegio registran un 95 por ciento de avance, y serán entregadas en enero próximo.

**Firma de convenio para nuevo COAR**

Antes, el viceministro de Gestión Institucional, el titular del Pronied y el gobernador regional de Lambayeque participaron de la firma de un convenio de Obras por Impuestos entre el Ministerio de Educación y el Banco de Crédito, que permitirá que más de 300 escolares de esta región cuenten con un moderno y equipado Colegio de Alto Rendimiento (COAR).

La entidad financiera invertirá 61 millones 502,943 soles que cubrirá el estudio de preinversión, la construcción de las áreas académicas, así como la provisión de mobiliario para el COAR ubicado en el centro poblado Villa El Milagro, en la provincia de Chiclayo, que estará listo a mediados de 2019.

**Visitas inopinadas en Chiclayo, Ferreñafe y Lambayeque**

El recorrido de los técnicos del Pronied llegó hasta la IE N° 11177, escuela rural ubicada en el centro poblado Cahuide del distrito de Jayanca, que cuenta con dos secciones multigrado del nivel primario que atienden a 47 alumnos. Se han instalado dos aulas prefabricadas, debido a que la infraestructura educativa colapsó producto de las lluvias durante el verano pasado.

Durante la inspección se constató que la infraestructura tiene más de 40 años y fue construida por los padres de familia. El terreno total es de una hectárea, pero sólo se ha cercado una parte.

Además, se visitó la IE de nivel inicial rural N° 420, ubicada en la misma zona de la provincia de Lambayeque y que atiende alrededor de 30 alumnos. En conversación con las directoras de ambos centros educativos surgió la posibilidad de juntar ambos niveles y tener un solo colegio de nivel inicial y primario. Ambas directoras manifestaron su entusiasmo con la idea de tener una infraestructura en mejores condiciones, por lo que se evaluará la atención a través del PIRCC.

Como parte de las inspecciones realizadas por Pronied en Lambayeque, se visitó la IE N° 10144 Virgen de Fátima de Motupe, en la que estudian 850 alumnos del nivel inicial y primario. En el local se instalaron hace unas semanas tres aulas prefabricadas utilizadas por alumnos de quinto y sexto de primaria, debido a que tras las lluvias causadas por El Niño costero colapsaron los salones de adobe. Se constató que el nivel primario ha sido gravemente afectado, y se evaluará su atención mediante el PIRCC.

También se visitó la IE N° 10225 de Túcume, que tiene 230 alumnos del nivel primario y en donde se instalaron cuatro aulas prefabricadas. Durante el 2017 se hicieron dos transferencias para el mantenimiento por un monto mayor a los 33,000 soles. Se verificó que el colegio cuenta con un Proyecto de Inversión Pública (PIP), por lo que también se evaluará su atención a través del PIRCC.

En el distrito de Motupe, se inspeccionó las obras en el colegio emblemático Cruz de Chalpón, con inversión directa del Pronied por un monto de 15 millones 500,000 soles y que cuenta con polideportivo, piscina, y talleres de zapatería y mecánica.

El equipo técnico del Pronied exhortó al contratista a terminar el levantamiento de observaciones antes del plazo límite (15 de enero de 2018).

 Actualmente, Trinidad tiene una estación central de bombeo que depende de la Gobernación, así como tres estaciones fijas de la comuna que evacúan las aguas fuera del anillo protector contra inundaciones. esch/kpb/                ABI

2386254,"Los niños afectados por los terremotos aún necesitan protección, apoyo psicoemocional y regresar a clases: no los perdamos de vista durante las fiestas *A tres meses de los terremotos del 7 y el 19 de septiembre, UNICEF señala la importancia de mantener a los niños afectados en el centro de la respuesta a corto, mediano y largo plazo.*

**Ciudad de México, 20 de diciembre de 2017 –** UNICEF, El Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia, señaló que aún hay acciones pendientes para garantizar los derechos de la infancia afectada por los terremotos que azotaron al país en septiembre, e insistió en el deber de no perder de vista a un sólo niño, niña o adolescente que requiera de apoyo.

“Aún hay familias con niños en Chiapas, Ciudad de México, Morelos, Oaxaca y Puebla en situación de vivienda precaria, sin acceso a escuelas o a servicios de salud adecuados”, comentó Christian Skoog, Representante de UNICEF en México.

“Es prioritario, tanto para el futuro de la infancia afectada como para el desarrollo de México, que estas familias reciban el apoyo adecuado para garantizar que sus hijos vivan bajo techo seguro, asistan a la escuela y vean cubiertas todas sus necesidades básicas”.

Además de hacer un llamado al país para que no pierda de vista las necesidades de estos niños, niñas y adolescentes, y se les brinden los apoyos necesarios, UNICEF informó sobre los resultados de sus propios esfuerzos hasta el momento.

Desde las primeras horas tras los terremotos del 7 y el 19 de septiembre, UNICEF llevó a cabo misiones de evaluación rápida para identificar las necesidades urgentes de la infancia, lo que permitió establecer un plan de respuesta centrado en tres prioridades: 

1) la protección y la atención psicoemocional de niños, niñas y adolescentes; 

2) el regreso a la escuela y la prevención del abandono escolar y 

3) el acceso a instalaciones adecuadas y el suministro de productos de higiene y saneamiento.

Para ello, la organización puso en marcha una campaña de recaudación de fondos y fortaleció alianzas con actores clave de la sociedad civil, el sector privado y los gobiernos, lo que ha sido fundamental para atender de forma inmediata estas áreas prioritarias. En su informe a tres meses de la respuesta a esta emergencia, UNICEF ha logrado:

- Instalar 34 Espacios Amigables para la Infancia y 100 Espacios Temporales de Aprendizaje en beneficio de 3,126 y 4,329 niños respectivamente.

- Distribuir 410 Escuelas en Una Caja (suministros escolares para el regreso a clases) en beneficio de 16,400 niños, 20 kits de Desarrollo Infantil Temprano, para 800 niños menores de 5 años y 2,400 Kits de higiene para 2,400 familias.

- Capacitar 353 maestros de forma directa y 5,296 de manera indirecta a través de una capacitación para capacitadores, así como de 171 facilitadores de los Espacios Amigables para la Infancia sobre herramientas y estrategias de apoyo psicoemocional.

- Difundir mensajes sobre promoción de la lactancia materna en 600 albergues y centros de acopio, en apoyo a 2,400 mujeres embarazadas y lactantes.

- Aunado al apoyo técnico y a la distribución de materiales y suministros básicos, UNICEF ha promovido mecanismos de participación mediante un levantamiento de encuestas de U-Report. A través de esta herramienta, más de 900 adolescentes y jóvenes han expresado sus inquietudes y levantado sus voces sobre la situación que están viviendo, así como sus necesidades particulares. La información recogida sirve como insumo importante para elplan de respuesta y abogacía de la organización.

Como próximos pasos, UNICEF ha diseñado un plan de recuperación temprana que se implementará entre enero y junio del 2018, con el objetivo de:

- Prevenir la deserción escolar que pueda resultar del retraso en el regreso a clases y establecer un sistema de monitoreo de niños, niñas y adolescentes fuera de la escuela después de la emergencia;

- Mantener apoyo constante para garantizar la recuperación psicoemocional de los niños y niñas afectados por el terremoto y brindar capacitación a aliados locales en la metodología de Espacios Amigables para la Infancia;

- Continuar con la instalación de baños, estaciones de lavado de manos y fuentes de agua potable en Espacios Temporales De Aprendizaje para mantener condiciones sanitarias seguras;

- Llevar a cabo una evaluación sectorial de las medidas de protección y la respuesta institucional en los estados afectados, así como al impacto directo e indirecto de los terremotos en la infancia;

- Abogar para priorizar a la niñez y a la adolescencia en los planes de reconstrucción, esto incluye, entre otros temas, tomar en cuenta sus necesidades específicas para los programas de protección social;

- Documentar la experiencia de lactancia durante la emergencia y posibles violaciones al Código Internacional de Sucedáneos de la Leche Materna;

- Capacitar profesionales de salud en la importancia de promover y proteger la práctica de la lactancia maternal en situaciones de emergencia;

- Seguir fortaleciendo las capacidades locales en materia de prevención y reducción del riesgo ante desastres, y Capacitar a las y los adolescentes para que brinden apoyo psicoemocional a sus pares.
“Mantener a los niños y niñas al centro de los esfuerzos de recuperación es fundamental tanto para la protección y recuperación física y emocional de cada niño o niña, como para el desarrollo presente y futuro del país”, señaló Christian Skoog, Representante de UNICEF en México.

“UNICEF agradece a todos los donantes, tanto individuales como empresariales, por responder de inmediato a las necesidades urgentes y a largo plazo de los niños, niñas y adolescentes afectados por los terremotos del 7 y el 19 de septiembre. Sin su apoyo, la respuesta humanitaria no sería posible”, agregó Christian Skoog.

**MEDELLÍN**

En el día de hoy la Unidad para las Víctimas entregó la indemnización reparadora a 267 víctimas de 19 municipios del departamento de Antioquia con recursos por valor de $1.393 millones, las cuales hacen parte de las 806 del mes de diciembre por valor de $4.136 millones.

Para Rosalba Marín, una de las beneficiadas del día de hoy en la jornada realizada en la ciudad de Medellín es ejemplo de vida y digna representante de superación. Marín, a pesar de ser víctima de desplazamiento y de múltiples inclemencias del conflicto armado en las que le tocó vivir, estas no fueron impedimento para salir adelante, hoy es docente y desde sus inicios en esta profesión lo hizo de manera empírica.

“Me llevé mis niños menores de edad desde Angelópolis para Urabá porque grupos armados nos hicieron dejarlo todo, la finca de café y los animales, éramos campesinos y de eso vivíamos. Cuando llegamos a Urabá, a todos nos tocaba trabajar, incluyendo a mi hija que en esa época era aún menor de edad y ahí fue donde grupos armados al margen de la ley de esa zona del país la violaron”, afirmó Rosalba Marín.

“Han sido años duros, teníamos una finca de café y me ha tocado hacer de todo, lavar ropa ajena, vender empanadas en la calle, cosas duras y a las que no estaba acostumbrada, pero no todo ha sido malo porque terminé el bachillerato y me dieron la oportunidad en Chigorodó y fui profesora empírica y luego de eso, a mis 56 años, pude graduarme como docente y actualmente enseño español en un colegio en otro municipio de Antioquia”, relató con orgullo esta madre Antioqueña.

En cuanto a la indemnización ella piensa invertir en un negocio que pueda manejar su esposo mientras que ella se jubila y hacer algunos arreglos en la vivienda.

Rosalba recibe con agrado el recurso en el que hoy fue favorecida, y entiende de la mejor manera los procesos que se realizan para poder tener la posibilidad de recibir este dinero, por lo que dice que “estoy muy agradecida con el Goberno Nacional, entiendo que esto es un proceso largo, y recibo este dinero en compensación a todo lo que hemos sufrido las víctimas”.

Para Jorge Mario Alzate Maldonado, director territorial de la Unidad para las Víctimas en Antioquia, “la mayoría de las personas indemnizadas destinan estos recursos para la compra o mejoramiento de vivienda, inicio o fortalecimiento de proyectos productivos, ahorro y educación superior”. Además, el funcionario señaló que “estos trámites son gratuitos, las víctimas no tienen que pagar nada por esas gestiones a tramitadores”.

En todas estas actividades los profesionales de la Unidad para las Víctimas orientan a las víctimas sobre descuentos y beneficios con entidades público-privadas, y también frente la inversión adecuada de los recursos, con el fin de que tengan un efecto reparador en sus vidas.

Durante la entrega de estos recursos se realizan actos simbólicos y de dignificación con el objetivo de que los sobrevivientes pueda darle una mirada esperanzadora al recurso entregado por el Gobierno Nacional, como compensación al daño sufrido por el conflicto armado con el que ellos puedan mejorar sus condiciones de vida.

En el mes de diciembre la Unidad para las Víctimas entregó la reparación administrativamente en Antioquia a 806 víctimas por valor de $4.136 millones.

En medio de la actividad se llevó a cabo un acto simbólico denominado ‘Renacimiento’, en el que las víctimas tenían en sus manos piedras que eran cambiadas por ladrillos como muestra de construcción de vida y entregados por la Directora general de la Unidad.

Durante su intervención, Pinto Afanador destacó que “gracias por el compromiso de los presentes para con las víctimas se puede construir todo eso que el conflicto destruyó: la familia, el tejido social, el bienestar, la convivencia y ayudar a la reparación para las victimas”.

“Si bien esta indemnización que entregamos no repara en su totalidad el daño causado, nos llena de confianza y esperanza en este país. Lo sé porque yo también lo viví como víctima. Estoy llena de confianza, de esperanza en este país, en la posibilidad que tenemo de ayudar a que nuestros hijos vivan una vida distinta y en paz, contraria a la que nos tocó”, enfatizó.

Así lo dio a conocer el funcionario durante la última reunión extraordinaria del Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional (Conasan), liderado por el vicepresidente Jafeth Cabrera Franco, que se llevó a cabo en las instalaciones del Ministerio de la Defensa Nacional (Mindef).

“Es de mencionar el trabajo que se ha estado realizando en conjunto con los ministerios de Salud, de Educación, de Agricultura y de Desarrollo Social para poder implementar la Estrategia. Lo que vamos a realizar para el año 2018 es incorporar a estos tres departamentos que ya están preparados para poder iniciar acciones en prevención de la desnutrición, desde las municipalidades“, dijo González.

Señaló que ya se tienen identificadas 51.000 familias “con nombre, apellido y código único de identificación”, las cuales están recibiendo intervenciones por parte de los ministerios involucrados, como parte del trabajo de la Estrategia.

“El reto que tenemos es poder doblar ese número para el año 2018 y que se puedan incorporar las siguientes familias de estos tres departamentos, adicionalmente estamos implementando el Sistema de Vigilancia Nutricional, que va a tener información que nos será de mucha utilidad para tomar decisiones”, manifestó el titular de la Sesan.

La estrategia

La Estrategia Nacional para la Prevención de la Desnutrición Crónica 2016-2020 surge como respuesta a que en Guatemala hay más de un millón de niños y niñas que se encuentran afectados por ese flagelo.
El objetivo de la estrategia es prevenir la desnutrición crónica en niños menores de dos años, para reducir ese indicador nacional en diez puntos porcentuales al 2020.

Se prevé que para lograr dicha meta se intensifiquen las acciones en siete departamentos en los cuales se registra alta prevalencia de desnutrición crónica.

2386144,"Agricultores de El Carmen podrán registrar avisos de quema gracias a convenio con CONAF **-El alcalde José San Martín valoró la medida que hará más expedito este trámite.**

Para facilitar el trámite de registro de uso del fuego para quemas agrícolas a los usuarios de El Carmen, la Corporación Nacional Forestal, CONAF, firmó esta mañana un convenio con la Municipalidad para implementar una oficina especial en sus dependencias y así facilitar el proceso de registro a quienes necesiten el documento. De este modo, ya no tendrán que viajar hasta Chillán, donde se ubica la Oficina Provincial de CONAF Ñuble, para efectuar este diligencia.

El convenio, que fue firmado entre el alcalde Julio San Martín y el Director Regional (S) de CONAF Biobío, Alberto Bordeu, señala que la Corporación capacitará a los funcionarios municipales designados para llevar adelante esta oficina y, asimismo, hará un seguimiento en todo el proceso de implementación.

“Con el objeto de descentralizar esta función institucional de CONAF es que hemos elaborado este convenio a fin de establecer una oficina receptora de avisos de quemas en esta comuna. En el caso particular de El Carmen, esta comuna posee un alto número de usuarios y muchos de ellos deben realizar un extenso viaje a Chillán para registrar su aviso de quema. Entonces, esta medida se hizo pensando en ellos. Todo esto no busca más que mejorar la atención hacia nuestros usuarios, ya que gracias a este convenio, el gasto en tiempo y dinero no tendrán que hacerlo más, ya que podrán realizar este trámite en su propia Municipalidad”, precisó Alberto Bordeu.

Por su parte, el alcalde José San Martín, agradeció a Corporación por esta iniciativa, “y es que El Carmen es una de las comunas que más tiene necesidades de este tipo de convenios por la gran dispersión de propiedades rurales que hay en la comuna, y además los agricultores acá son en general pequeños propietarios, entonces producen bastante atochamiento en la oficina de CONAF cada vez que van a gestionar su aviso. Y esto va a contribuir justamente a hacer más ágil el proceso y, también, al darse estas las facilidades, los agricultores no tendrán excusa para no informar de su faena de quema”.

Conocido es que en los campos de nuestro país se utiliza el fuego como herramienta para eliminar residuos vegetales que quedan después de faenas agrícolas y/o forestales en predios rurales.

Debido a los múltiples impactos que se generan con ello, por ejemplo riesgo de incendios forestales, esta práctica es regulada para minimizarlos. La legislación faculta a CONAF, a través del Decreto Supremo 276/1980, del Ministerio de Agricultura, para establecer medidas de utilización del fuego en forma segura y sólo como quema controlada.

Para realizar una quema controlada es necesario que, antes de usar el fuego, el agricultor se acerque a las oficinas de CONAF y avise de su intención de hacer una quema controlada. En éstas le solicitarán algunos antecedentes y le entregarán un comprobante de su aviso de quema, el que señalará días, horas y medidas imprescindibles de ejecutar antes y durante la quema controlada. Una vez que tenga el comprobante en su poder e implemente las medidas, el usuario podrá realizarla en las fechas y horas que éste señale.",269,"Spanish"

Hace dos años Juan Carlos y su familia tuvieron que dejar todo lo que conocían. Él fue amenazado por actores armados en el departamento del Guaviare, oriente de Colombia y su historia se sumó a la de más de siete millones de desplazados registrados en el país.

""En la finca teníamos de todo: yuca, plátano, panela y animales. Todo para llegar a la ciudad, donde todo toca comprarlo. Pasamos muchas necesidades porque no había dinero ni trabajo y tocaba meternos a trabajar en lo que fuera, en lo que resultara"", dice Juan Carlos. No fue fácil lidiar con las dificultades económicas de empezar de cero en una ciudad desconocida, una a la que no quería llegar pero le tocó.

Después de la desaparición de su hermano mayor y la muerte de su esposa por una enfermedad, Juan Carlos salió de su finca junto a su madre y 10 hermanos hacia Villavicencio (centro oriente de Colombia). Su tierra la vendieron a bajos precios a raíz del temor que tenían.

Para poder mantener a su familia, Juan Carlos trabajó por sueldos bajos en construcción, elaboración de cercas, limpieza de potreros y hasta fumigación de cultivos hasta que se encontró con el programa de acceso al empleo para víctimas del conflicto armado y la violencia del Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja (CICR) en el departamento de Meta (oriente de Colombia).

El objetivo de este programa es mejorar las condiciones económicas de estas personas a través del fortalecimiento de sus capacidades laborales y el acceso a un empleo formal. 

Fue así como, en 2016, Juan Carlos se vinculó laboralmente con la empresa Seguridad Furtiva LTDA, donde ahora es considerado un empleado ejemplar. ""Él se ha desempeñado como excelente guarda de seguridad desde que entró. Siempre lo pongo de ejemplo porque se le ve el esmero y las ganas de salir adelante"", dice Gustavo Bastidas, director operativo de la compañía.

2386069,"América Central debilita escudos forestales contra sequías del futuro **SAN JOSÉ, 20 dic 2017 (IPS) -** Jazziel Baca vive en el municipio de Esquías, en el occidente de Honduras, uno de los más afectados por la plaga del gorgojo descortezador, que dañó casi 500.000 hectáreas de bosque de su país entre el 2013 y el 2015.

Se suponía que la plaga que aniquilaba los pinos detendría su paso con la lluvia, pero pasaron los meses húmedos y nada cayó del cielo. Hoy, con menos árboles, contó a IPS que su pueblo tiene, también, menos agua, sus suelos están erosionados y algunas de las comunidades vecinas enfrentan sequías.

No es el único problema que provoca que se queden sin agua.

En Honduras la cobertura forestal cayó en casi un tercio al pasar de 57 por ciento en el 2000 a 41 por ciento en el 2015, explicado por el aumento de monocultivos, proyectos extractivos, ganadería y la agricultura migratoria.

Se trata del país de América Central con mayor caída en la cobertura forestal, en una región donde todas las naciones, menos Costa Rica, destruyen su capa de bosques.

De hecho, según destaca el Programa del Estado de la Región en las estadísticas ambientales de 2017 que publicó este mes, desde 2000 América Central tuvo una caída en su cobertura forestal y de humedales, vitales en la mantención de cuencas acuíferas, que coincidió con un aumento regional generalizado en las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, los que más contribuyen al recalentamiento planetario.

No es una buena noticia, dijo Alberto Mora, coordinador de investigación del Estado de la Región, más aún si se considera que la región podría tener 68 departamentos en condiciones de alta aridez hacia finales de siglo, cuando actualmente son menos de 20 los que presentan esta condición.

Mora también destacó que las estimaciones de demanda de agua potable podrían crecer en un 1.600 por ciento para el año 2100, de acuerdo al estudio que elabora el Estado de la Nación de Costa Rica, un órgano interdisciplinario de expertos financiado por una agrupación de todas las universidades públicas.

“Esto agudiza mucho los impactos del calentamiento global y del aumento de las temperaturas, sobre los ecosistemas y las especies que hay en ellos. Es realmente un problema grave en Centroamérica”, comentó a IPS.

**Menos árboles, menos alimentos**

Baca, ingeniera ambiental que participa en la organización no gubernamental ambientalista Amigos de la Tierra, explicó que los campesinos están migrando montaña arriba, porque los suelos donde antes trabajaban ya no son fértiles. Así, utilizando prácticas como la quema y la roza, cultivan sus granos básicos.

Pero, además, contó, “tenemos sequías muy prolongadas y, al no tener temporadas de lluvia, los campesinos y campesinas no pueden sembrar sus alimentos, provocando situaciones de emergencia en cuanto a la seguridad alimentaria”.

Al oeste de Honduras, en su vecino Guatemala también se reportan pérdidas en los mantos forestales. En 2000, era 39 por ciento de su territorio el que estaba cubierto por árboles, mientras que en el 2015 esa proporción había descendido a 33 por ciento.

Aunque cada vez se talan menos hectáreas en ese país, el problema persiste y genera graves retos de seguridad alimentaria.

Ogden Rodas, especialista de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura (FAO) en ese país, explicó a IPS desde Ciudad de Guatemala que la pérdida de bosques está afectando la capacidad de obtener alimentos de los guatemaltecos de múltiples formas.

Actualmente, dijo, comunidades campesinas y de indígenas tienen menos alimentos procedentes de semillas, raíces, frutos u hojas y menos trabajos, que antes eran generados por las limpias, podas, entre otros.

Su capacidad de llevar alimento a sus hogares también se ve impactada, pues la destrucción de la capa forestal golpea los ciclos hidrológicos que luego sirven para la agricultura de riego.

Roda cree que su país tiene que fortalecer la gobernanza, el ordenamiento de los cultivos agroindustriales como la caña de azúcar y la palma africana, crear alternativas para los grupos que viven en el bosque y desarrollar estrategias para el uso sostenible de la leña: un problema común en la región.

En Honduras, recordó a IPS desde Tegucigalpa otro especialista de la FAO, René Acosta, el gobierno se ha comprometido a restaurar hasta un millón de hectáreas hacia el 2030, pero la tarea será imposible si no se coordina con todos los actores involucrados, se generan incentivos y capacidades de negocios ecoturísticos.

**Costa Rica aumenta cobertura boscosa**

La cobertura forestal centroamericana decreció de 46 por ciento en 2000 a  41 por ciento en  2015, en un fenómeno diferente en cada país.

Nicaragua, pasó de 32 a 26 por ciento de capa boscosa, Panamá la redujo de 66 por ciento a 62 por ciento y El Salvador de 16 a 13 por ciento.

La excepción fue Costa Rica donde más de la mitad (54 por ciento) de los suelos de están cubiertos por árboles, cuando 15 años atrás la proporción era de un 47 por ciento.

Pieter Van Lierop, oficial forestal del Grupo de Recursos Naturales, Gestión de Riesgos y Cambio Climático de la FAO en Costa Rica, explicó que hay muchas razones que fundamentan ese proceso.

Eso se debe, afirmó, “en parte a la priorización de la política forestal para los gobiernos del país”.

“Otro de los factores es los cambios estructurales en la agricultura, que han reducido la presión para convertir bosques en terrenos agrícolas y han dado lugar a un incremento de la superficie de bosques secundarios y los controles jurídicos para evitar el cambio del bosque natural a otros usos de la tierra”, dijo.

Algunas prácticas sostenibles apoyan ese aumento de las áreas boscosas en el país.

Por ejemplo, existe un programa de pago por servicios ambientales desde hace dos décadas, financiado por un impuesto a los combustibles fósiles, entre otras fuentes.

El Estado paga el equivalente a 300 dólares cada cinco años por cada hectárea privada de bosque protegido y 1.128 dólares  para los propietarios que deseen crear un bosque secundario en sus fincas.

“¿Qué hemos ganado con esto? Que mucha más gente venga a ver los bosques”, explicó Gilmar Navarrrete, uno de los encargados de la jefatura del programa del Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal.

“También recientemente pasó el huracán Otto: si las coberturas de bosque no existieran de la forma en que existían, el impacto habría sido gravísimo”, aseguró a IPS.

Hay otros programas. Lourdes Salazar trabaja en Paquera, Lepanto y Cóbano, al noroeste de Costa Rica,  con 83 productores en un programa financiado por la no gubernamental Fundecooperación y apoyado por otras instituciones públicas,

“Vamos de la mano con los productores porque queremos que se adapten al cambio climático, que establezcan pasturas mejoradas, y que cambien la mentalidad. Queremos que dejen que crezcan árboles frutales, maderables, para sombra, que también les van a ayudar a producir más”, dijo a IPS la ingeniera agrónoma.

Salazar forma parte de un proyecto con 10 millones de dólares de fondos, que pretende impactar a 400 fincas de alrededor de cinco hectáreas, en las que cada productor debe reforestar mientras se dedica a su actividades agropecuarias de ganado, huertas orgánicas y porquerizas.

“Ellos mismos dicen que es más beneficioso. Si en un potrero había solo un árbol ahí se amontonaban todas las vacas. ¿Por qué no dejar más árboles? Ellos mismos han ido aprendiendo que producen más cuando implementan este tipo de prácticas”, cerró Salazar.",269,"Spanish"

2385749,"503. A tres meses de los sismos se cumple con la entrega de infraestructura médica en Puebla **El Secretario de Salud, realizó una gira de trabajo en esta entidad, donde atestiguó el cumplimiento del Compromiso 24/7 del gobierno estatal.**

A sólo tres meses de los sismos del 19 de septiembre, el Secretario de Salud, José Narro Robles y el gobernador José Antonio Gali Fayad, entregaron un renovado hospital general en Atlixco, cuyas obras de remodelación tuvieron una inversión de más de siete millones de pesos.

Este complejo médico combina la tecnología con la medicina ancestral, al contar con un módulo de medicina tradicional y una posada de Atención a la Mujer Embarazada, donde las futuras madres serán apoyadas por parteras tradicionales para el nacimiento de su bebé, además de un centro de atención a las adicciones y un banco de leche.

Durante la ceremonia realizada en la explanada de este complejo médico, el Secretario de Salud subrayó que esta remodelación y entrega es resultado del trabajo en equipo, con lo que se demuestra una vez más que con unidad se solucionan los problemas prioritarios.

Durante su visita a esta entidad, el doctor Narro Robles atestiguó el cumplimiento del compromiso número uno en salud que adquirió el gobernador José Antonio Gali Fayad, denominado 24/7, el cual consiste en garantizar a la población atención médica las 24 horas los siete días de la semana en toda la entidad, y que implicó una inversión de 150 millones de pesos.

Al respecto Narro Robles señaló que con el cumplimiento de esta estrategia se garantiza la salud de seis millones de poblanos, ya que contar con servicios médicos 24/7 significa más salud.

En su oportunidad, el gobernador José Antonio Gali Fayad detalló que para el cumplimiento del Compromiso 24/7 en toda la entidad, se adquirieron 17 unidades médicas móviles, una por cada municipio que no contaba con la infraestructura y personal para dar el servicio los 365 días del año.

Estas unidades cuentan con insumos y profesionales de la salud para atender las diferentes patologías que afectan a la población, como el infarto.

En este acto el Secretario de Salud y el Gobernador hicieron entrega de las llaves de las unidades móviles a los presidentes municipales de Comocuautla, Coatepec, San Felipe Tepatlan, Atlequizayan, Caxhuacan, Ixtepec, Cohuecán, Ahuehuetitla, Axutla, Coyotepec, La Magdalena Tlatlauquitepec, San Jerónimo Xayacatlán, San Juan Atzompa, Santa Catarian Tlaltempan, Teopantlán, Totoltepec de Guerrero y Xicotlán.

El Hospital de Atlixco, cuenta con un banco de leche totalmente equipado y es dirigido por un equipo médico que brinda información sobre los beneficios de la lactancia materna, tanto para el recién nacido como para la madre. También se les enseña las diferentes formas de estimular la producción de leche a través de masajes.

A cada una de las madres se le lleva un conteo de su producción a fin de que se motiven, y aquellas que tienen una mayor producción de leche se les invita a que la donen para los bebés prematuros, pues es fundamental este alimento para que fortalezcan su sistema inmunológico.

Asimismo, cuenta con un servicio de medicina tradicional y una posada de Atención a la Mujer Embarazada, donde se brinda una atención integral, que combina la medicina alópata con la ancestral, ya que parteras tradicionales están al cuidado y acompañan en todo momento a la futura madre.

Con la remodelación del Hospital de Atlixco y el cumplimiento del Compromiso 24/7 se garantiza una atención médica oportuna y de calidad para todos los poblanos.

2385534,"El recrudecimiento de los enfrentamientos nos obliga a detener nuestras actividades en la ciudad de Hodeidah - Más de 500 000 personas podrían verse afectadas en la región por los enfrentamientos

- Hacemos un llamamiento a todas las partes para que cesen las hostilidades, respeten el derecho internacional humanitario y permitan el acceso libre y sin obstáculos a la ayuda humanitaria hasta la población civil

Madrid, 20 de diciembre de 2017

Tras dos años en los que las líneas del frente han permanecido retenidas, el actual avance de las tropas de la coalición encabezada por Arabia Saudí sobre la costa hace aumentar el temor por la seguridad de la población civil yemení.

La línea del frente se ha extendido 60 kilómetros al norte de la ciudad de Mocha, llegando a los distritos del sur de Hodeidah. Las más de 500 000 personas que podrían verse afectadas en la región por los enfrentamientos, apenas cuentan con infraestructuras de salud y otros servicios básicos.

“Trabajamos en cinco distritos de Hodeidah. Dos de ellos, Hays y At Tuhayat, cuentan con seis centros de salud que ahora son completamente inaccesibles debido a los combates”, señala Federico Soranzo, director de Acción contra el Hambre en Yemen. “Dos de estos centros, que denominamos de estabilización, brindan una atención vital a más de 120 niños desnutridos menores de cinco años desde junio”. Además, el puerto de Hodeidah es una de las principales puertas de entrada del comercio y la ayuda humanitaria en el país. El actual bloqueo está resultando en una escasez de combustible y en un aumento de precios sin precedentes.

“El país podría quedarse sin combustible antes de fin de año y las existencias disminuyen día a día. En Hodeidah, no hay electricidad desde hace un año y las pocas estructuras de salud aún funcionales usan generadores alimentados con combustible. Si comenzara a escasear podría tener consecuencias inimaginables para todos los servicios básicos y la población, que ya sufre una situación dramática”, explica Federico Soranzo.

Desde Acción contra el Hambre reiteramos nuestro llamamiento a todas las partes en el conflicto para que:

- cesen todas las hostilidades en las áreas habitadas de la región de Hodeidah y de todo el país  
- respeten sus obligaciones en virtud del derecho internacional humanitario y garanticen la plena protección de la población y las infraestructuras civiles  
- permitan el acceso humanitario completo y sin obstáculos, y faciliten el movimiento de los trabajadores humanitarios en la región de Hodeidah  
- levanten de inmediato todas las restricciones a la importación de bienes comerciales básicos

Desde Acción contra el Hambre trabajamos de forma permanente en Yemen desde 2012 y actualmente estamos poniendo en marcha la respuesta humanitaria de emergencia en las provincias de Hajjah, Hodeidah, Abyan, Lahj, y Aden.

Desde principios de año hasta octubre de 2017, hemos brindado apoyo a cerca de 200 000 personas en la gobernación de Hodeidah. Nuestra respuesta humanitaria incluye programas de acceso a estructuras de salud y prevención, detección y tratamiento de la desnutrición, fortalecimiento de la seguridad alimentaria y los medios de vida, acceso al agua, la higiene y el saneamiento. Contamos con un equipo de 260 trabajadores nacionales e internacionales en el país.

**Acción contra el Hambre es una organización humanitaria internacional que lucha contra las causas y los efectos del hambre. Salvamos la vida de niños y niñas desnutridos.

2385459,"Migración y Trabajo Infantil - nuevo estudio de OIM, SBS y OIT En el marco del Día Internacional de la Persona Migrante, la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM), la Secretaría de Bienestar Social de la Presidencia (SBS) y la Organización Internacional del Trabajo (OIT) presentaron el estudio Migración y Trabajo Infantil, en Guatemala ,con el objetivo de brindar un panorama más claro sobre las formas de trabajo y de las principales características de la niñez trabajadora migrante no acompañada, a fin de impulsar el diseño de medidas de política dirigidas a mejorar la atención y el acompañamiento en la reintegración de las y los retornados, así como prevenir la migración irregular de niñas, niños y adolescentes.

Los resultados de la encuesta muestran que la migración de la niñez no acompañada retornada a Guatemala es multicausal y que, en su mayoría, proviene de los departamentos del altiplano occidental y de El Petén. Dentro de los motivos expresados, 75% de niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes no acompañados retornados aseguraron haber viajado en busca de mejores condiciones de vida, seguidos por la reunificación familiar (47%) y trabajo (37%).

El sondeo también descubrió que más del 90% de esta población no cumple con la escolaridad esperada. Este porcentaje es mayor para el grupo que realizaba algún tipo de trabajo previo a migrar, lo que sugiere que el tiempo dedicado a actividades productivas limitó las posibilidades de desarrollo para niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes no acompañados retornados.

Además, 79% de la niñez y adolescencia retornada a Guatemala invirtió más de 22 horas semanales a actividades laborales familiares no remuneradas antes de migrar. Este porcentaje es mayor para las niñas. Por otro lado, el grupo que trabajaba de manera remunerada representa una menor proporción (32% mayoritariamente niños), pero el tiempo dedicado es superior (más de 36 horas por semana).

La agricultura fue el sector que más mencionaron, tanto para trabajo remunerado y no remunerado, en el caso de niños; mientras que para las niñas son las actividades domésticas en su hogar y en casa de terceros. Para la niñez y adolescencia migrante retornada que laboraba de forma remunerada antes de migrar, la investigación encontró que ellas y ellos viven en hogares con niveles de vulnerabilidad levemente superiores que el resto: piso de tierra, falta de acceso a agua potable y no propiedad de la vivienda.

La migración es un derecho. Sin embargo, miles de personas migran de manera irregular lo que les coloca en situación de vulnerabilidad ante el crimen organizado y otros riesgos a su integridad física y psicológica en la ruta, lo que se ha convertido en una creciente preocupación para los países de Centroamérica.

El proceso migratorio más intenso en la región se produce de Centroamérica a México y Estados Unidos, de forma irregular. En esta ruta, se pone en riesgo el cumplimiento pleno de los derechos fundamentales con lo que no solo se afecta a la persona – incluyendo niñas, niños y adolescentes -  sino también al desarrollo de los países y de su población en diversos ámbitos.

“Hacemos un llamado al Estado, a la sociedad y a la familia guatemalteca para que unan esfuerzos a favor de la garantía y cumplimiento pleno de la Convención de Derechos del Niño, con especial énfasis en la niñez y adolescencia migrante no acompañada retornada. Es imperante que – en todas las decisiones que tomemos – prioricemos aquello que erradique la explotación infantil, que minimice cada vez más los riesgos de la migración irregular y que restituya por completo los derechos fundamentales de la población migrante más joven que regresa a Guatemala. Así, aportaremos al desarrollo del país a favor de todas y todos”, dijo el Jefe de Misión para El Salvador, Guatemala y Honduras, Jorge Peraza Breedy.

Por su parte, Carmen Moreno, Directora de la Oficina de la OIT para América Central, Haití, Panamá y República Dominicana, señaló que desde el 2007 la migración de niños, niñas y adolescentes no acompañados, especialmente en el Triángulo Norte, tiende al aumento e incentiva situaciones de trabajo infantil y de sus peores formas. En este sentido, Moreno destacó que la colaboración con la OIM ha sido clave para visibilizar el vínculo del trabajo infantil y la migración en la subregión, pues el trabajo conjunto ha permitido profundizar aún más en esta realidad y promover la investigación, seguimiento y puesta en agenda del tema.

El estudio Migración y Trabajo Infantil 2017 es el resultado del esfuerzo conjunto de ambas organizaciones de las Naciones Unidas, y del gobierno de Guatemala, que les llevó, en los últimos años, a comprometerse con la mejora del conocimiento y la comprensión de la realidad migratoria irregular, en especial de las niñas, niños y adolescentes que migran sin compañía y realizan el viaje en condiciones muy precarias, expuestos a graves riesgos. La investigación constituye una primera aproximación de carácter exploratorio a las características del trabajo infantil en esta población, utilizando como plataforma una muestra y un instrumento especializado en niñez migrante retornada, aplicado en Guatemala entre los meses de mayo y octubre de 2017. La entrevista incluyó una pequeña batería de preguntas para captar información sobre la realización de trabajo por parte de los niños, niñas y adolescentes migrantes no acompañados, tanto en su comunidad de origen, en su familia y como expectativa en el destino.

2385374,"La Unión Europea aumenta apoyo a la Convención sobre la Prohibición de Minas Antipersonal, pide a los que utilizan estas armas que abandonen su uso Viena, Bruselas, Ginebra - La Unión Europea (UE) ha anunciado un apoyo adicional para que los países afectados puedan cumplir con sus obligaciones en virtud de la Convención sobre la Prohibición de Minas Antipersonal que prohíbe el uso, la producción, la transferencia y el almacenamiento de estas armas. 

La UE reafirmó su firme apoyo a la Convención durante la Decimosexta Reunión de los Estados Parte de la Convención que se celebra en Viena. Más de 400 representantes de organizaciones gubernamentales, internacionales y no gubernamentales se reúnen en la sede de la ONU en Viena para abordar la implementación del histórico tratado de desarme humanitario firmado este diciembre hace 20 años. 

""La UE condena el uso de minas antipersonal por parte de cualquier actor, ya sean Estados o actores no estatales. También hacemos un llamamiento a todos los Estados que no hacen parte de la Convención y a actores no estatales para que dejen de fabricar, comerciar y usar estas armas"", dijo Jacek Bylica, Enviado Especial de la UE para Desarme y No Proliferación durante la reunión. ""Particularmente preocupante es el uso de minas antipersonal improvisadas en el contexto de la guerra urbana, hecho específicamente para aterrorizar a los civiles y obstaculizar el regreso de desplazados internos y refugiados. Este es un factor clave que obliga a la población a dejar sus hogares y un factor importante tras la actual crisis de refugiados"", agregó Jacek Bylica. 

""El uso de minas antipersonal improvisadas ha creado una nueva contaminación a gran escala en Iraq, un Estado Parte de la Convención, así coomo Libia y Siria, países que aún no se han unido. El uso de estas minas improvisadas ha provocado una reversión en el número de víctimas mundiales de minas por segundo año consecutivo, desde la entrada en vigencia de la Convención. Las nuevas amenazas deben abordarse con determinación pero sin distraer la atención de las vastas áreas en todo el mundo que permanecen inaccesibles debido a la contaminación heredada de guerras"", dijo el Enviado de la UE, ya que países como Angola, Camboya y Zimbabue siguen sufriendo los efectos de las minas antipersonal plantadas hace décadas. 

“Su impacto continúa afectando de manera desproporcionada a las comunidades rurales, generalmente algunas de las más pobres, así como a las minorías y los grupos marginados"". No deben ser olvidados. A la luz de estos acontecimientos, es necesario reafirmar nuestro compromiso con respecto a la cooperación y la asistencia internacional ya que la obligación de librar al mundo de las minas antipersonal es un esfuerzo colectivo de todos los Estados Partes”. 

**Asistencia financiera de la Unión Europea a la acción contra las minas**
 
La UE y sus Estados Miembros son uno de los mayores donantes mundiales de acción humanitaria contra las minas. La ayuda de la UE incluye remoción de minas, educación sobre riesgos, asistencia a víctimas, destrucción de arsenales y beneficios para casi todos los países gravemente afectados, incluidos Chad, Colombia, Croacia, Iraq, Laos, Líbano, Libia, Myanmar, Siria y Ucrania. 

En el período 2012-2016, la UE, a través de sus instituciones y Estados Miembros, comprometió más de 600 millones de euros para hacer frente a la amenaza de las minas y los restos explosivos de guerra en los países afectados por conflictos. 

Sin embargo, algunos Estados Parte necesitan apoyo adicional para el desarrollo de la capacidad a fin de identificar y superar los desafíos pendientes si desean cumplir su ambición de un mundo libre de minas para 2025. 

La Unión Europea, a través de una Decisión del Consejo, asignará 2,3 millones de euros adicionales para promover la adhesión universal al tratado, incluidos los enviados especiales de la Convención, el Príncipe Mired de Jordania y la Princesa Astrid de Bélgica. Otros proyectos en virtud de la Decisión del Consejo ayudarán a los Estados Parte a cumplir sus compromisos en materia de remoción de minas, destrucción de existencias y asistencia a las víctimas en virtud del Plan de Acción de Maputo para 2014 de la Convención. 

“La Decisión facilitará las reuniones nacionales de partes interesadas en los países afectados por las minas con las autoridades pertinentes, las organizaciones internacionales y no gubernamentales, los donantes y las comunidades afectadas por las minas. En el espíritu de asociación incluido en la Convención, la aplicación de esta Decisión incluirá la participación del grupo ganador del Premio Nobel de la Paz 1997, la Campaña Internacional para la Prohibición de las Minas Terrestres, el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja y otras organizaciones de las Naciones Unidas e internacionales pertinentes”, dijo Jacek Bylica 

**La Convención de prohibición de minas antipersonal**
 
La Convención fue adoptada en Oslo y firmada en Ottawa en diciembre de 1997. Hasta la fecha, hay 163 Estados Parte: la semana pasada, Sri Lanka, país fuertemente afectado por las minas, se unió al tratado. Los Estados Parte han destruido más de 51 millones de minas antipersonal y liberado millones de hectáreas de tierras que estaban contaminadas. Hasta la fecha, 30 Estados han declarado estar libres de minas, mientras que 31 continúan implementando su obligación de desminado. 29 Estados Parte han declarado la responsabilidad de un gran número -cientos o miles- de supervivientes de minas, incluidos algunos de los países más pobres del mundo, y enfrentan a desafíos importantes para cumplir con sus responsabilidades.

- ***La Dirección Meteorológica de Chile pronóstico la caída de entre 30 a 40 milímetros de precipitaciones entre la tarde del miércoles y la madrugada del jueves, lo que podría provocar nuevos aluviones. Además, las autoridades determinaron que la villa se mantenga deshabitada mientras se desarrolle el sistema frontal.***

Esta tarde, en dependencias de ONEMI, se desarrolló una nueva mesa técnica para evaluar las medidas adoptadas tras el aluvión ocurrido el pasado sábado 16 de diciembre en la Villa Santa Lucía, Región de Los Lagos, y futuras acciones.

Según información de la Dirección Meteorológica de Chile (DMC), se esperan precipitaciones entre 30 y 40 mm. e isoterma alta –hasta 2.800 metros- entre la tarde del miércoles y la madrugada del jueves, lo que podría generar nuevos aluviones.

Dado estos antecedentes, el Intendente de Los Lagos, Leonardo de la Prida, informó que “cuando llueve cae más material y eso puede generar un riesgo para la población. Con estos antecedentes, el Director Nacional de ONEMI y otras autoridades determinarán mañana si se suspende momentáneamente la búsqueda de personas”. También se decidió mantener la evacuación para pobladores y rescatistas que trabajan en la Villa Santa Lucía durante el paso del sistema frontal.

Además se informó que al mediodía quedó habilitado, para vehículos de emergencia y 4×4, el bypass que permitirá el traslado entre Palena y Futaleufú con la Región de Aysén. Sin embargo, el tránsito por esta vía tendrá uso exclusivo para vehículos de emergencia. Adicionalmente, el ingreso a Villa Santa Lucía se mantiene restringido debido al establecimiento de una zona de exclusión.

La migración irregular e insegura es con frecuencia la consecuencia de la falta de información relacionada con los riesgos involucrados en el proceso, del pobre conocimiento sobre visas, sobre los riesgos a la salud, sobre las regulaciones vigentes para poder viajar, la interacción inexistente o limitada con proveedores de servicios legítimos, y la ausencia de una plataforma balanceada y unificada con información y servicios en materia migratoria que sean confiables y estén actualizados.

La aplicación MigApp responde a la necesidad de ayudar a que los migrantes tomen decisiones informadas  a lo largo de su proceso migratorio, mediante la provisión de una plataforma integral con información relevante y actualizada. En su versión de lanzamiento, la MigApp incorpora información vinculada a la cuestión de la migración, como por ejemplo los requisitos y regulaciones para viajar, informes sobre incidentes mundiales y  líneas de emergencia relacionadas con la lucha contra la trata en todo el planeta a las cuales es posible llamar.

Cabe mencionar que Paraguay -a través de la directora de la DGEEC- participó del Lanzamiento del Proceso de Monitoreo del Marco Sendai para la Reducción del Riesgo de Desastres 2015-2030 y el taller técnico organizado por la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas para la Reducción de Riesgos de Desastres (UNISDR), realizados entre el 6 y el 8 de diciembre pasados en la ciudad de Bonn, Alemania.

Durante el taller técnico, los participantes recibieron capacitación sobre el Sistema de Monitoreo del Marco de Sendai, incluyendo su entrada de datos, capacidades analíticas y niveles de aplicación a nivel local, nacional, regional y global. Varios países también presentaron su progreso hasta la fecha en la implementación de este Marco.

El Marco de Sendai para la Reducción del Riesgo de Desastres 2015-2030 surgió de la Tercera Conferencia Mundial de las Naciones Unidas en el año 2015, donde los países miembros, entre ellos Paraguay, se comprometieron a adoptar en los siguientes años acciones que permitan reducir el riesgo de desastres y de las pérdidas ocasionadas por los mismos.

El importante documento establece un objetivo, cuatro prioridades y siete metas globales para la gestión integral del riesgo de desastres, que se relacionan con reducir la mortalidad mundial causada por desastres, las pérdidas económicas que conllevan, incrementar el número de países que cuenten con estrategias de reducción de riesgos de desastres, mejorar la cooperación internacional, entre otras acciones a ser implementadas hasta el año 2030.",269,"Spanish"

2383774,"Balance de periodistas asesinados, detenidos, secuestrados y desaparecidos en el mundo en 2017 **Balance de RSF: estas cifras siguen siendo alarmantes**

Reporteros sin Fronteras (RSF) publica su Balance anual de ataques cometidos contra periodistas en el mundo. En 2017, 65 periodistas fueron asesinados; 326 se encuentran detenidos actualmente y 54 están secuestrados. 

65 reporteros fueron asesinados debido al ejercicio de su labor informativa*, ya sea mientras realizaban su trabajo, víctimas de un bombardeo, por ejemplo, o de forma deliberada porque sus investigaciones molestaban. La mayoría de los reporteros asesinados, 60%, eran periodistas profesionales.

Aunque el año 2017 ha sido el menos mortífero para los periodistas profesionales desde hace 14 años –50 perdieron la vida–, estas cifras siguen siendo alarmantes. De hecho, desde 2012 se ha observado un descenso constante en este rubro. Cierto, los periodistas han huido de los países que se han vuelto muy peligrosos, como Siria, Yemen o Libia. Pero también RSF observa una mayor toma de consciencia sobre la importancia de proteger a los periodistas. Desde 2006 la ONU ha adoptado diversas resoluciones relativas a la protección de periodistas. Asimismo, en las redacciones de numerosos medios de comunicación se han establecido medidas de seguridad.

La disminución de las agresiones no concierne a las periodistas, pues en 2017 se duplicó el número de reporteras asesinadas: diez murieron este año, mientras que en 2016 fueron cinco. La mayoría de ellas eran aguerridas y experimentadas periodistas de investigación. A pesar de las amenazas que habían recibido, muchas de ellas seguían investigando y revelando casos de corrupción, como Daphne Caruana Galizia en Malta, Gauri Lankesh en India y Miroslava Breach Velducea en México. 

Otra tendencia notable del año 2017 es que ciertos países en paz fueron casi tan peligrosos para los periodistas como algunos que se encuentran en guerra: 46% de los reporteros fueron asesinados en países donde no existen conflictos armados declarados, mientras que en 2016 se trató de 30%. Así, en México se registró casi el mismo número de periodistas asesinados (11) que en Siria, el país más mortífero para los reporteros (12 asesinados).

Christophe Deloire, secretario general de RSF, lamenta que ""los periodistas de investigación que trabajan sobre temas importantes como la corrupción o los escándalos ambientales, y quienes juegan un papel fundamental de contrapoder, sean convertidos en blanco de aquellos a quienes estas investigaciones incomodan. Esta alarmante situación nos recuerda la necesidad de proteger aún más a los periodistas, en un período de globalización de los desafíos de la información y de la internacionalización de la amenaza"". 

Hasta el 1 de diciembre de 2017, 326 periodistas se encontraban tras las rejas por haber ejercido su labor informativa. Al igual que en el caso de los periodistas asesinados, el número de reporteros detenidos es menor este año (-6%). Aunque la tendencia general es a la baja, ciertos países que hasta ahora no habían sido identificados como “países-prisión” para los profesionales de los medios de comunicación, se distinguieron por un número inusualmente elevado de periodistas encarcelados. Es el caso de Rusia y Marruecos. Por otra parte, a escala mundial, cerca de la mitad de los periodistas detenidos aún se concentra en cinco países. China y Turquía siguen siendo las mayores prisiones de periodistas en el mundo.

Para finalizar, actualmente en el mundo 54 periodistas se encuentran en manos de grupos armados o criminales (que no pertenecen al Estado), como el grupo Estado Islámico o los Hutíes en Yemen. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los reporteros secuestrados son periodistas locales, que a menudo trabajan en condiciones precarias y que comportan grandes riesgos. Todos los casos de periodistas extranjeros secuestrados se registraron en Siria; hasta ahora no se ha podido precisar el lugar donde se encuentran.

2383744,"Estrategia Interagencial de Protección de Colombia 2018-2020 **1. Introducción**

**a. Contexto general**

El prolongado conflicto armado interno en Colombia ha afectado por más de cinco décadas a la población civil. En el 2012, el Gobierno y las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), iniciaron oficialmente conversaciones de paz que terminaron en un acuerdo final en 2016. En marzo de 2016, se iniciaron las negociaciones de paz con un grupo armado no estatal más pequeño, el Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), con un cese al fuego que inició en octubre de 2017. Un tercer grupo armado no estatal, el Ejército Popular de Liberación (EPL), permanece activo en las zonas fronterizas con Venezuela. En varias áreas, especialmente en Nariño y Meta-Guaviare-Vaupés, disidentes de las FARC se han reagrupado o se han unido a otros grupos armados. Otros actores armados actualmente activos incluyen los grupos que resurgieron de una desmovilización parcial de organizaciones paramilitares entre 2003 y 2006, a menudo denominados como grupos armados post-desmovilización, y también como grupos más pequeños de criminalidad local.

Las principales causas del desplazamiento en Colombia han sido los enfrentamientos armados, las amenazas y asesinatos contra la población civil. Se estima que como consecuencia del conflicto han sido asesinados más de 220.000 civiles y 7.4 millones han sido obligados a desplazarse de sus hogares.

Además, la actual situación política y las condiciones socioeconómicas en Venezuela han contribuido a que un gran número de personas salgan del país. Colombia reportó en octubre de 2017 un aumento neto de 3,600 venezolanos que llegan diariamente a Colombia. Se estima que hay más de 700,000 personas venezolanas en el país, de las cuales un número creciente tienen necesidades de protección internacional.

**b. Relevancia general y propósito**

Esta Estrategia de Protección establece un objetivo estratégico general para todas las agencias de Naciones Unidas y organizaciones internacionales para responder a la situación de desplazamiento forzado, de comunidades afectadas a violaciones de derechos humanos en el marco del conflicto armado y de la violencia generalizada en el contexto de implementación de los acuerdos de paz en Colombia, y de la situación de migración mixta. Esta estrategia tiene como objetivo ser una guía para las agencias de Naciones Unidas y las organizaciones internacionales para que de manera coordinada se identifiquen y se brinde respuesta a los riesgos de protección que enfrentan las personas desplazadas, las poblaciones afectadas por el conflicto armado y la violencia generalizada, las personas con necesidad de protección internacional, las poblaciones retornadas y se brinde asistencia a los flujos mixtos de migración cuando la situación así lo requiera. Esta Estrategia de Protección se ha desarrollado en estrecha coordinación con un proceso paralelo de elaboración de la Estrategia Interagencial de Género; ambas estrategias comparten un Plan de Acción Conjunto consolidado. También fue elaborado en articulación con el Plan de Respuesta Humanitaria de Colombia para el 2018.  

La Estrategia Interagencial de Protección se diseñó a partir de las conclusiones del Análisis de Protección del Equipo Humanitario País (EHP) (ver Anexo 2) para el cual, los insumos fueron recolectados a través de una extensa revisión de documentos, discusiones bilaterales con agencias de la ONU, organizaciones internacionales, ONGs nacionales e internacionales, agencias gubernamentales, organizaciones comunitarias, representantes de los desplazados internos, Clúster de Protección y otros, Equipos Locales de Coordinación (ELC) y Grupos Temáticos de Protección (GTP). El Análisis de Protección se llevó a cabo entre marzo y julio de 2017.  

Posteriormente, se organizaron un total de siete sesiones de trabajo ad hoc (julio-agosto de 2017) para socializar el Análisis de Protección y definir la Estrategia. Cada grupo se centró en una (a veces dos) de un total de ocho preocupaciones específicas de protección identificadas a través del Análisis de Protección. A cada sesión se le encomendó la tarea de examinar y validar el Objetivo Estratégico general y los tres Objetivos Estratégicos principales, con el fin de responder a las preocupaciones de protección.",269,"Spanish"

Luego de visitar la casa modelo del proyecto que beneficiará a más de 1.200 familias y tras su intervención en la entrega de estas obras, el Ministro Villegas dijo que “llevamos nueve meses desde la tragedia y  ya se ven las obras”.

“Vengo de visitar las casas que se van a entregar, más el colegio, el acueducto, el hospital, la biblioteca, el centro lúdico, la casa de víctimas, la casa de paz; en fin, hay obras públicas por todos lados”.

Con respecto a las comunicaciones, el Ministro informó que “este municipio va tener cuatro zonas WiFi que ya están funcionando y dos más que vienen para los barrios periféricos. Tenemos TDT, vienen los decodificadores, se entregaron 4.500 tablets para los estudiantes, 200 becas de tecnología para la información y las comunicaciones, además de cupos adicionales en el programa ‘Ser Pilo Paga’ y está en proceso la certificación del Instituto Tecnológico del Putumayo”.

Al referirse a las vías, el jefe de la cartera de Defensa afirmó que “obras como esta las vamos a ver en miles de metros por todo Mocoa. El Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) ya nos aprobó el crédito para el alcantarillado. Mocoa va a quedar con un tratamiento sanitario de las mejores calidades mundiales. Ese proceso tomará tres años -2018, 2019 y 2020- y dejará a Mocoa en el estado del arte en saneamiento ambiental”.

“Me falta la última gran decisión que son las obras de mitigación en las cuencas altas y medias, para tratar de que si la naturaleza decide otra vez desencadenar su ira, la podamos enfrentar de la mejor manera posible: con alertas tempranas y con obras de mitigación. Con el diseño ya arrancaron y espero que en los primeros meses del 2018 podamos estar ya dándoles luz verde a esas obras de mitigación”.

Con notoria emoción, el Ministro Villegas ratificó que “me lleno de ilusión al ver que Mocoa va a ser una ciudad moderna, limpia, con unas obras sólidas y de calidad”.

Finalmente, brindó su saludo de Navidad a los mocoanos: “Feliz Navidad a los mocoanos, a los putumayenses, a todos los compañeros servidores públicos que han estado en estos nueve meses entregando su vida y su conocimiento porque esta reconstrucción salga bien. A mis compañeros de la Fuerza Pública infinito agradecimiento por haber estado aquí el día de la emergencia y por haberse quedado acompañando a los mocoanos a construir una mejor ciudad”.",269,"Spanish"

La Región del Pacífico comprende los departamentos del Chocó, Valle del Cauca, Cauca, Nariño Históricamente la población de la región ha sufrido doble afectación por conflicto y desastres de origen natural, lo que incrementa su condición de riesgo y vulnerabilidad. En 2016, la confrontación entre grupos armados no estatales y la Fuerza Pública, así como el accionar de los grupos armados posdesmovilización (GAPD) derivó en graves consecuencias humanitarias entre las que se destacan los desplazamientos forzados, restricciones a la movilidad y al acceso a servicios básicos, amenazas, homicidios, reclutamiento, violencia sexual, entre otros. Las poblaciones indígenas y afrodescendientes, entre ellas mujeres, niños y niñas, siguen siendo las más afectadas por estos hechos.  
Este escenario se ha mantenido en lo los primeros tres meses del año 2017, con alrededor de 20 emergencias en los departamentos focalizados.  
Las autoridades locales y nacionales, los respectivos Equipos Locales de Coordinación (ELC) y diversas agencias y organizaciones internacionales, asi como el Comité Interinstitucional Humanitario de Buenaventura, han respondido a estas emergencias, pero las afectaciones a las poblaciones ya han desbordado la capacidad de respuesta. Por ello, desde el Equipo Humanitario País (EHP), el Grupo Intercluster (GiC) y el Coordinador Residente y Humanitario, se dio la iniciativa de construir una Estrategia de Respuesta para la zona del Pacífico, como una hoja de ruta para la visibilización y búsqueda de soluciones humanitarias.

**Prioridades humanitarias**

Los Equipos Locales de Coordinación de los 4 departamentos de la costa pacífica han identificado múltiples necesidades en la población afectada por las emergencias, y han resaltado la importancia de la incidencia de alto nivel en búsqueda del fortalecimiento institucional en prevención y una mejor preparación para la atención y respuesta a los desafíos humanitarios que enfrentan. En este contexto, se han identificado prioridades en los sectores de Salud, Protección, Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición, Agua,  
Saneamiento Básico e Higiene, Albergue, Educación en Emergencia y Recuperación Temprana. Se considera un enfoque poblacional prioritario en mujeres, niños, niñas y población indígena y afro, siendo quiénes han sufrido mayor afectación y se encuentran en mayor vulnerabilidad frente a riesgos de protección y afectaciones varias.",269,"Spanish"

2383634,"Día Internacional del Migrante: por un 2018 de migraciones seguras para los niños *En 2016 un total de 40,114 niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes fueron detenidos en México.*

**NUEVA YORK, 18 DE DICIEMBRE 2017 -** 2018 podría ser un año histórico para las niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes si los países establecen acuerdos y buenas prácticas para garantizar su seguridad y bienestar.

En el marco del Día Internacional del Migrante, que se conmemora cada año el 18 de diciembre, UNICEF recuerda que unos 50 millones de niños y niñas se encuentran actualmente en tránsito en todo el mundo.

“Para muchos niños, la migración es segura y regular, y esto les permite a ellos, sus familias y sus comunidades crecer y transformarse”, explica el Director de Programas de UNICEF, Ted Chaiban. “Pero hay otra realidad, la que viven millones de niños para los cuales la migración, que ellos no han elegido, es muy peligrosa”.

Aproximadamente 28 millones de niños, niñas y adolescentes se han visto forzados a abandonar sus hogares debido a conflictos e inseguridad. En muchos casos, niños y familias no cuentan con rutas migratorias lo suficientemente seguras y estables y, por lo tanto, no tienen más opción que recurrir a traficantes, redes de trata y rutas informales que ponen sus vidas y su seguridad en riesgo.
Un ejemplo claro de esta situación es la peligrosa ruta del Mediterráneo Central, que abarca el trayecto entre Libia e Italia. Sólo este año, cerca de 15,000 niños no acompañados han llegado a Italia por mar, en un viaje normalmente facilitado por traficantes. UNICEF estima que más de 400 niños han muerto desde principios del 2017 tratando de hacer este viaje, mientras que miles han sufrido abuso, explotación, esclavitud y detenciones mientras atravesaban Libia.

En México, de acuerdo a la Unidad de Política Migratoria de la Secretaría de Gobernación, en 2016 un total de 40,114 niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes fueron detenidos. De este total, 38,555 niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes fueron deportados a sus países de origen, entre ellos 17,318 niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes no acompañados.

El próximo año tendrán lugar las negociaciones y la adopción del Pacto Mundial sobre las Migraciones, un acuerdo histórico sin precedentes que cubrirá todas las dimensiones de la migración internacional. Este es momento para que todos los países establezcan un acuerdo con acciones concretas para apoyar a las niñas y a los niños migrantes, en línea con la Declaración de Nueva York sobre Refugiados y Migrantes, y con la Convención sobre los Derechos del Niño.

En medio de las actuales negociaciones sobre la esencia del pacto, UNICEF ha hecho un llamado a los Estados Miembros para que en el texto final contemplen los derechos, la protección y el bienestar de los niños migrantes y refugiados como compromisos centrales.

“La migración, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, no tiene por qué ser peligrosa”, asegura Chaiban. “Las políticas, prácticas y actitudes que ponen a los niños en riesgo pueden y deben cambiar. 2018 es el momento para hacerlo. El Pacto Mundial sobre las Migraciones es una oportunidad”.

Muchos gobiernos locales, regionales y nacionales de todo el mundo ya han tomado medidas concretas para garantizar la protección de la niñez migrante. Algunas de estas buenas prácticas, integradas en el informe de UNICEF Más allá de las fronteras, incluyen:

- Invertir en el fortalecimiento de los sistemas nacionales de protección de la infancia de modo que sean incluyentes para proteger a los niños migrantes frente al abuso, la explotación y la violencia.

- Invertir en las capacidades de recepción y cuidado de niñas y niños migrantes, y promover las alternativas a la detención basadas en la comunidad, contando con responsables frente a las autoridades migratorias y pagando las cuotas administrativas correspondientes.

- Eliminar los obstáculos en la práctica que detienen o retrasan la reunificación familiar o que hacen que esta reunificación esté fuera del alcance de muchos niños debido a las definiciones limitadas del concepto de familia o por la falta de recursos financieros.

- Garantizar que en los retornos se preste atención a las necesidades individuales -el niño y su interés superior, la madre, el padre- y que se diseñen medidas de reintegración que aborden sus necesidades y beneficien de forma estructural a sus comunidades de origen.

- Abrir centros educativos y de salud para niños migrantes y permitir que exista una separación clara entre los roles de las autoridades migratorias y los servicios públicos básicos, para garantizar que todos los niños están escolarizados y sanos y que tengan el acceso a la justicia y a una vivienda digna sin miedo de ser identificados, detenidos o expulsados.

- Mejorar las condiciones de transferencias de remesas, para que más niños puedan ir a la escuela o al médico.

**Nota para los editores:**

UNICEF pide a los gobiernos que adopten el plan de seis puntos para proteger a las niñas y a los niños refugiados y migrantes, y garantizar su bienestar:

1. Proteger contra la explotación y la violencia a los niños refugiados y migrantes, en particular a los no acompañados.

2. Terminar con las detenciones de los niños migrantes o que solicitan el estatus de refugiado, implantando una serie de alternativas adecuadas.

3. Mantener a las familias unidas como la mejor forma de proteger a los niños y dotarles de un estatus legal.

4. Garantizar educación para todos los niños refugiados y migrantes, y darles acceso a servicios de calidad, entre ellos sanitarios.

5. Exigir que se actúe sobre las causas subyacentes de los grandes desplazamientos de refugiados y migrantes.

6. Promover medidas para luchar contra la xenofobia, la discriminación y la marginación en los países de tránsito y destino.

**Sobre UNICEF en México**

Esta tarde la Jefa de Estado, Michelle Bachelet, llegó hasta localidad de Villa Santa Lucía, comuna de Chaitén, para visitar y apoyar a las familias afectadas por el aluvión del pasado sábado.

Durante su visita, donde fue acompañada por el ministro de Obras Públicas, Alberto Undurraga, la máxima autoridad del país sostuvo una reunión del Comité Opertaivo de Emergencia (COE), visitó la Posta Rural de Villa Santa Lucía y realizó un sobre vuelo por la zona afectada por la catástrofe.

Además, visitó la localidad de La Junta, en la Región de Aysén, donde conversó con voluntarios que están trabajando en el albergue habilitado que actualmente acoge a 66 personas.

“Hemos tenido una reunión donde he recibido toda la información de parte, por un lado, de la ONEMI Regional, la cantidad de fuerzas humanas, de recursos materiales. También, cada rama ha informado la cantidad de aeronaves existentes en la zona trabajando en distintas tareas”, señaló la Mandataria ante los medios de comunicación.

La Jefa de Estado explicó que la primera prioridad del Gobierno es ayudar a las familias damnificadas.

“Frente a una catástrofe de esta naturaleza, lo primero son las personas: por un lado, proteger a las personas que lograron sobrevivir a esta tragedia, por otro lado, rescatar a los desaparecidos, rescatar a los fallecidos, buscando su identificación y luego de ser identificados responsablemente e informar a la familia, para evitar errores que pueden ser tremendos del punto de vista humano”, señaló.

Asimismo, destacó el apoyo y trabajo de las diversas autoridades en el control de la catástrofe.

“Aquí ha habido 4 comunas que han estado permanentemente apoyándonos, que son las de Puerto Cisne, que vino de inmediato; por supuesto Chaitén, pero que está en dificultad por esto de accesibilidad; Palena; y hoy día también el alcalde de Futaleufú con equipos especializados, más la gente de las instituciones públicas”, afirmó.

En cuanto a las personas damnificadas, la Presidenta Bachelet explicó que “hay familias que fueron afectadas completamente, además de sus viviendas; hay familias que han tenido personas que han sobrevivido; y hay familias que sus viviendas no tienen ningún tipo de aflicción sino que más bien es el temor a poder tener un aluvión que los pueda afectar, es el que los ha hecho buscar lugares más seguros fuera del radio de riesgo, un lugar donde estar”.

En esta línea, afirmó que el Gobierno tiene una serie de instrumentos para ir en ayuda de los damnificados, y que como primer objetivo será recopilar toda la información sobre las necesidades de cada familia.

“La alcaldesa está levantando la encuesta FIBE, con la cual se recopila la información sobre todos los daños que cada familia tiene para poder identificar cuáles son los instrumentos (..)

Circunstancias, momentos y motivos diferentes hicieron que dejaran su país para emprender la ruta migratoria. Ambos sufrieron accidentes en el camino que les provocaron amputaciones. En Tapachula, Chiapas, tomaron una rehabilitación para adaptarse a las prótesis que han hecho que puedan caminar de nuevo.

Una de las primeras imágenes que llegan a la mente cuando se habla de la ruta migratoria en México es el tren, pues se trata de uno los principales medios de transporte que usan las personas migrantes para llegar a su destino. Sin embargo, representa a la vez uno de los peligros más grandes de la ruta. Yeyson y Noel son parte del alarmante número de personas que ha sufrido accidentes relacionados con el tren en algún punto del trayecto.

Yeyson perdió las dos piernas al resbalarse con unas piedras cuando intentaba subir al tren en Huehuetoca, Estado de México. Mientras que Noel perdió una en un choque cerca de Tula, Hidalgo.

Ambos fueron auxiliados por la Cruz Roja Mexicana, y ahora están juntos en el centro de rehabilitación física del Sistema Nacional para el Desarrollo Integral de la Familia (DIF) de México en Tapachula, con el apoyo técnico y financiero del Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja (CICR), para recuperar la fuerza en los músculos y adaptarse a sus extremidades artificiales.

El CICR trabaja con personas migrantes amputadas a través del programa de rehabilitación física. Éste opera en México, El Salvador, Guatemala y Honduras. En general, consiste en coordinar y capacitar al personal médico para la rehabilitación de las personas, además de la entrega y mantenimiento de prótesis y órtesis.

En Guatemala, Honduras y El Salvador, el programa atiende a personas migrantes retornadas, mientras que en México considera a migrantes en tránsito, que se quedan en el país para recibir rehabilitación física y acceso a prótesis, como en los casos de Yeyson y Noel.

Las personas migrantes son valoradas por un médico y, al estar en condiciones de hacerlo, siguen el proceso para aprender a usar sus prótesis en centros de rehabilitación física, identificados en cada uno de los países en los que el programa está en marcha.

En México, el centro está en Tapachula, Chiapas. Mismo lugar del taller Ortimex, fabricante de las prótesis con tecnología desarrollada por el CICR. Éstas están hechas con un material a base de polipropileno, que hace que sean resistentes, duraderas y económicas.

Este lunes comenzó en Bogotá el Encuentro Nacional de Sujetos de Reparación Colectiva que busca fortalecer las capacidades ciudadanas y políticas, la participación y la incidencia de las víctimas en escenarios de diálogo mediante el intercambio de saberes sobre la experiencia histórica, informó la entidad.

La jornada de trabajo se desarrollará por dos días y en ella participarán más de 80 líderes de todo el territorio colombiano que buscan un escenario de encuentro, diálogo y retroalimentación entre los sujetos de reparación colectiva partícipes, con el fin de realizar un intercambio de experiencias y saberes.

“Este encuentro nos permite conocer los diferentes casos y situaciones que en cada territorio se han vivido; poder informarnos y tener pleno conocimiento para compartirlo con nuestras comunidades. El objetivo es capacitarnos”, expresó Miguel Taquinás, proveniente de Corinto, en el departamento de Cauca.

La agenda del encuentro comprende dinámicas de cuidado y apoyo colectivo; intercambios de saberes y talleres alrededor de tres temas centrales: liderazgo, capacidades políticas y participación territorial.

Al finalizar la fase inicial de intercambio de saberes, y con la culminación de los talleres, se realizará un panel sobre lo trabajado de manera grupal. La pregunta que orientará el diálogo será: “¿Cómo la reparación colectiva puede potenciar el liderazgo, el fortalecimiento de las capacidades políticas y la participación territorial?”

MEDELLÍN
La Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura (FAO) y la Unidad para la Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas acordaron en Medellín la suscripción de un convenio de cooperación para implementar a nivel nacional proyectos de desarrollo rural a favor de comunidades afectadas por el conflicto armado.

Tras reunirse con delegados de esta agencia de la ONU, la directora nacional de la Unidad para la Reparación Integral a las Víctimas, Yolanda Pinto de Gaviria, destacó que, inicialmente, se planeaba firmar una carta de intención para unir esfuerzos, pero que daba la importancia de la cooperación entre la entidad y el organismo de la ONU “vamos a suscribir un convenio que nos va a permitir pasar del asistencialismo a la generación de proyectos productivos agrarios sostenibles, además de seguridad alimentaria”.

La funcionaria destacó además que la experiencia y gestión de recursos de cooperación internacional de la FAO “fortalecerá la implementación de los planes de reparación colectiva en zonas de especial interés para el escenario de postconflicto en el país, como ya se viene haciendo con buenos resultados en comunidades priorizadas en 14 municipios del país”.

En Antioquia, ya se benefician del fortalecimiento de proyectos productivos y esquemas de comercialización comunidades que son sujetos de reparación colectiva en San Carlos, Granada, Urrao, Dabeiba y Turbo.

Otro de los objetivos del convenio será impulsar proyectos con impacto en el desarrollo agrario sostenible y seguridad alimentaria que se articulen con la implementación de los puntos 1 (tierras y desarrollo agrario) y 5 (derechos de las víctimas) del Acuerdo de Paz entre el Gobierno y las Farc.

Para Juan Zuluaga, coordinador en Antioquia de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura (FAO), la “alianza estratégica con la Unidad para la Reparación a las Víctimas debe potenciar a nivel nacional el trabajo que venimos realizando para generar con asistencia técnica y formación los esquemas de desarrollo rural que permitan a muchas comunidades afectadas por el conflicto, como aquellas que son sujetos de reparación colectiva, pasar de tener solo modelos de producción a esquemas de administración del territorio y construcción social de mercados de los que hasta ahora carecen”.

El convenio entre la FAO y la Unidad para las Víctimas podrá acceder a recursos de cooperación internacional gestionados en los siguientes fondos: Fondo de Paz y Posconflicto del Banco Mundial, Fondo Fiduciario  de Naciones Unidas para el posconflicto, Fondo fiduciario de la Unión Europea para el posconflicto y Fondo Colombia Sostenible, apoyado por el BID.

2382099,"En 2016 mas de 40,000 niños migrantes fueron detenidos en México **50 millones de niños y niñas** se encuentran actualmente en tránsito en todo el mundo, recuerda UNICEF en el marco del Día Internacional del Migrante.

“Para muchos niños, la migración es segura y regular, y esto les permite a ellos, sus familias y sus comunidades crecer y transformarse”, explica el Director de Programas de UNICEF, Ted Chaiban, en un comunicado de prensa publicado hoy , que se conmemora cada año el 18 de diciembre.

“Pero hay otra realidad, la que viven millones de niños para los cuales la migración, que ellos no han elegido, es muy peligrosa”, advirtió.

Aproximadamente **28 millones de niños, niñas y adolescentes se han visto forzados a abandonar sus hogares debido a conflictos e inseguridad.** En muchos casos, niños y familias no cuentan con rutas migratorias lo suficientemente seguras y estables y, por lo tanto, no tienen más opción que recurrir a traficantes, redes de trata y rutas informales que ponen sus vidas y su seguridad en riesgo.

Un ejemplo claro de esta situación es la peligrosa ruta del Mediterráneo Central, que abarca el trayecto entre Libia e Italia. Sólo este año, cerca de **15,000 niños** no acompañados han llegado a Italia por mar, en un viaje normalmente facilitado por traficantes.

UNICEF estima que más de **400 niños han muerto desde principios del 2017** tratando de hacer este viaje, mientras que miles han sufrido abuso, explotación, esclavitud y detenciones mientras atravesaban Libia.

En México, de acuerdo a la Unidad de Política Migratoria de la Secretaría de Gobernación, **en 2016 un total de 40,114 niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes fueron detenidos.** De este total, 38,555 niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes fueron deportados a sus países de origen, entre ellos 17,318 niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes no acompañados.

El próximo año tendrán lugar las negociaciones y la adopción del **Pacto Mundial sobre Migraciones,** un acuerdo in precedentes que cubrirá todas las dimensiones de la migración internacional.

Este es momento para que todos los países establezcan un acuerdo con acciones concretas para apoyar a las niñas y a los niños migrantes, en línea con la Declaración de Nueva York sobre Refugiados y Migrantes, y con la Convención sobre los Derechos del Niño.

En medio de las actuales negociaciones sobre la esencia del pacto, UNICEF ha hecho un llamado a los Estados Miembros para que en el texto final contemplen los derechos, la protección y el bienestar de los niños migrantes y refugiados como compromisos centrales.

“La migración, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, no tiene por qué ser peligrosa”, asegura Chaiban. “Las políticas, prácticas y actitudes que ponen a los niños en riesgo pueden y deben cambiar. 2018 es el momento para hacerlo. El Pacto Mundial sobre las Migraciones es una oportunidad”.

2018 podría ser un año histórico para las niñas, niños y adolescentes migrantes, dijo UNICEF, si los países establecen acuerdos y buenas prácticas para garantizar su seguridad y bienestar.

Sedapal informó que 54 millones de soles costaron los trabajos de reparación de su infraestructura hidráulica que en marzo de este año sufrió daños por la caída sucesiva de huaicos en los ríos Rímac y Huaycoloro, como consecuencia del Fenómeno El Niño costero.

**Sacan toneladas de lodo de estanque de Sedapal que almacena agua para emergencias**

El monto de reparación fue cubierto por el Seguro del Sistema de Gestión de Desastres implementado por Sedapal. Por ello, los procesos de captación, producción y distribución de agua potable en beneficio de la población de Lima y Callao se brindan ahora en forma normal. 

Igualmente, las plantas de tratamiento de aguas residuales y los sistemas de recolección de las aguas servidas también están operando con normalidad.

**Solidaridad internacional se vio reflejada luego del huracán**

San José, 18 dic. 2017. Motivado por el esfuerzo de la cancillería y la gran necesidad en que dejo el paso del Huracán Otto por Costa Rica, el gobierno de Catar donó $1 millón para obras de recuperación de este incidente natural.

Para el Presidente de la Comisión de Emergencias Dr. Iván Brenes Reyes, tanto el huracán Otto como la tormenta tropical Nate generaron muchos efectos que se identificaron tanto dentro como fuera del territorio costarricense.

“Estos actos (donativo) permitieron visualizar la solidaridad que incluso trascendió nuestras fronteras y es por eso que la Comisión Nacional de Emergencias agradece al Estado de Catar por medio del Embajador de Catar en Costa Rica, Mohammed Bin Kurdi Taleb Al Marri, este donativo que será de gran apoyo tanto para la reconstrucción de infraestructura como de apoyo a la producción en las zonas afectadas” manifestó Brenes.

Por su parte el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Manuel González Sáenz, declaró su agradecimiento al Estado de Catar por el hecho de recibir colaboración de un Estado que no posee ninguna obligación de hacerlo, principalmente porque este acercamiento se empezó a producir a tan solo una semana de presentado el huracán Otto en nuestro país.

2382079,"En 2018 hay que lograr que la migración sea segura para todos los niños y niñas, dice UNICEF **NUEVA YORK/CIUDAD DE PANAMÁ, 15 de diciembre de 2017 -** El año 2018 podría ser histórico para los niños y niñas migrantes si los países deciden adoptar las mejores prácticas para garantizar su seguridad y bienestar, dijo hoy UNICEF con motivo del Día Internacional del Migrante, que se celebra el 18 de diciembre.

Unos 50 millones de niños y niñas se encuentran en tránsito en todo el mundo. 6,3 millones de migrantes en todo el continente americano son menores de 18 años. Gran parte de esta migración es positiva, y los niños y sus familias se trasladan de manera voluntaria y segura. Sin embargo, la experiencia migratoria de otros millones de niños no es de ningún modo voluntaria ni segura, sino que está plagada de riesgos y peligros.

Aproximadamente 28 millones de niños y niñas han tenido que abandonar sus hogares a la fuerza debido a algún tipo de conflicto. En muchos casos, los niños y las familias que no cuentan con vías de migración suficientemente seguras y legales no tienen otra opción que recurrir a contrabandistas y traficantes de personas, o utilizar rutas no oficiales que ponen gravemente en peligro su seguridad.

La peligrosa ruta de Centroamérica y México hacia Estados Unidos o la del Mediterráneo central desde Libia hasta Italia son ejemplo de ello. Según datos del gobierno de Estados Unidos, entre 2015 y 2016 fueron detenidos cerca de 60.000 niños y niñas provenientes de El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras y México. Solo este año, casi 15.000 niños no acompañados han llegado a Italia por mar, en periplos organizados generalmente por tratantes y traficantes de seres humanos. UNICEF estima que, desde comienzos de año, más de 400 niños han muerto cuando realizaban este viaje, mientras que otros miles han sido víctimas de actos de abusos, explotación, esclavitud y detenciones mientras transitaban por Libia.

“Para un número incalculable de niños, la migración es segura y legal, y esto les ayuda –a ellos, a sus familias y a sus comunidades– a crecer y transformarse”, dijo Ted Chaiban, Director de Programas de UNICEF. “Sin embargo, otros millones de niños hacen frente a una realidad diferente: para ellos, la migración es enormemente peligrosa y no es algo que ellos hayan elegido hacer. La ruta del Mediterráneo central es un ejemplo que revela cómo miles de niños vulnerables arriesgan sus vidas todos los años para llegar a Europa porque no cuentan con rutas de migración seguras y legales para emigrar”.

El próximo año se llevarán a cabo las negociaciones para la aprobación del Pacto Mundial para las Migraciones, un histórico acuerdo intergubernamental que abarcará todas las dimensiones de la migración internacional. Es un momento óptimo para que los países acuerden las medidas que han de tomar para apoyar a los niños migrantes, de conformidad con la Declaración de Nueva York para los Refugiados y los Migrantes y la Convención sobre los Derechos del Niño.

A lo largo de las negociaciones en curso sobre el contenido del Pacto, UNICEF ha seguido pidiendo a los Estados Miembros que incluyan los derechos, la protección y el bienestar de los niños y niñas desarraigados entre los principales compromisos del texto final.

“La migración, especialmente para los niños, no tiene por qué ser peligrosa”, dijo Chaiban. “Las políticas, prácticas y actitudes que ponen en riesgo a los niños migrantes pueden y deben cambiar, y 2018 es el momento de lograrlo, y el Pacto Mundial para la Migración representa una oportunidad”.

Muchos gobiernos nacionales, regionales y locales de todo el mundo ya han decidido tomar medidas positivas para proteger y cuidar a los niños y niñas migrantes. Algunas de estas buenas prácticas, destacadas en el reciente informe de UNICEF Más allá de las fronteras, incluyen lo siguiente:

- Invertir en sistemas nacionales sólidos e incluyentes de protección de la infancia para proteger a los niños y niñas migrantes contra la explotación y la violencia;

- Invertir en las capacidades de acogida y de atención y promover otras soluciones basadas en las comunidades a fin de evitar la detención, informando sistemáticamente sobre las exigencias, las garantías o los depositarios;

- Eliminar los obstáculos prácticos que suspenden o imposibilitan la unificación familiar para un gran número de niños y niñas, como por ejemplo las definiciones restrictivas relativas a las cuotas familiares o los umbrales de ingresos financieros;

- Facilitar las devoluciones que tienen en cuenta al individuo: el niño o niña y la determinación de su interés superior, la madre y el padre, y diseñar medidas de reintegración que aborden sus necesidades y beneficien a la comunidad de manera sostenible;

- Abrir las escuelas y los centros de salud a los niños y niñas migrantes y establecer “cortafuegos” entre los servicios de inmigración y los servicios públicos, a fin de que cada niño pueda seguir aprendiendo y creciendo con buena salud y pueda tener acceso a la justicia y la vivienda sin temor a que los detecten, detengan o deporten;

- Mejorar las condiciones de las transferencias de remesas para aumentar el número de niños y niñas que puedan ser enviados a la escuela o al médico.

**Nota para los editores:**

UNICEF ha estado pidiendo a los gobiernos y asociados que adopten seis políticas esenciales esbozadas en el Programa de Acción de UNICEF para los Niños Desarraigados:

- Proteger a los niños y niñas refugiados y migrantes, especialmente a los no acompañados, de la explotación y la violencia;

- Acabar con la detención de niños y niñas migrantes o que esperan obtener la condición de refugiados;

- Mantener unidas a las familias como la forma más adecuada para proteger a los niños y niñas y concederles un estatus legal;

- Mantener estudiando a todos los niños y niñas refugiados y migrantes y darles acceso a la salud y a otros servicios de calidad;

- Insistir en la necesidad de abordar las causas subyacentes a los movimientos a gran escala de refugiados y migrantes;

- Promover medidas para combatir la xenofobia, la discriminación y la marginación en los países de tránsito y de destino.

2382074,"Puerto Rico recuenta las muertes por el huracán María **Estudios independientes elevan la cifra de defunciones vinculadas al ciclón a centenares**

El huracán María hizo volar en Puerto Rico árboles, casas y estadísticas. Casi tres meses después del del ciclón que azotó el 20 de septiembre la isla caribeña el Gobierno no ha sido capaz de contabilizar con certeza el número de muertes directas e indirectas relacionadas con sus efectos, el más mortífero la pérdida de electricidad en hospitales y domicilios que provocó graves limitaciones en la atención a pacientes. La cifra oficial de defunciones se mantiene en 64, pero estudios independientes de diversos medios elevan el número a centenares. El gobernador de Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rosselló, ha ordenado una revisión completa de las defunciones posteriores al huracán.

""Cada vida es más que un número, y cada muerte debe tener un nombre e información vital adjunta, así como una contabilidad precisa de los hechos relacionados con su fallecimiento"", dijo Rosselló en un comunicado que solo se envió a la prensa internacional. ""Deseamos el recuento más preciso y la comprensión de cómo las personas perdieron sus vidas. Así contabilizaremos el impacto de estas tormentas e identificaremos cómo podemos evitar muertes antes de futuros desastres”.

Un análisis de The New York Times de datos oficiales evidenció que en los 42 días posteriores al huracán murieron en Puerto Rico 1.052 personas más que la media en esas fechas en 2015 y 2016. El Centro de Periodismo Investigativo de Puerto Rico ofreció un dato similar: 985 muertos adicionales en los primeros 40 días. CNN informó de que, según datos de empresas funerarias de la isla, el número de fallecimientos por efecto de María era de al menos medio millar más que la cifra oficial.

La devastación causada por el huracán, el más fuerte en la isla en las últimas nueve décadas, destrozó su envejecida infraestructura eléctrica. Aún hoy un 30% de la población sigue sin electricidad. El apagón de las primeras semanas obligó al cierre de hospitales y clínicas y dejó a otros centros en situaciones extremas, incapaces de dar un tratamiento completo a pacientes que necesitaba de diálisis o de oxígeno. En muchos domicilios se vivió una lucha contrarreloj para cuidar de la salud de familiares enfermos, en especial de los ancianos. Los más afortunados volaron con ellos a EE UU.

Las causas de muerte principales después del huracán María fueron la diabetes y el alzhéimer. Los fallecimiento por sepsis –infecciones severas que se pueden deber a malas condiciones higiénicas– aumentaron un 50%. Una explicación de la baja cifra oficial de muertes es que no existe un protocolo que indique a los médicos que en los partes de defunción, más allá de la causa directa, se especifique, en contextos de crisis como el paso de un huracán, si fueron determinantes los factores coyunturales.

La orden de Rosselló para cuantificar los efectos mortales directos e indirectos de María implica que se deberán revisar los certificados de defunción y entrevistar a los médicos que los firmaron, así como a los familiares del fallecido. El gobernador añadió que un ""panel de expertos"" diseñará un nuevo protocolo de registro de defunciones.",269,"Spanish"

Además, se realizaron talleres con 77 escuelas rurales, en los que se capacitó a un total de 150 maestros, 1100 niños y sus familias.**


El pasado año, nuestro país a través del SINAE firmó con la FAO (Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura) un Acuerdo para ejecutar un Proyecto para la recuperación de los medios de vida de agricultores familiares afectados por las inundaciones. El mismo comenzó a implementarse en agosto de 2016 y finalizó en noviembre del presente año, por un monto total de 480 mil dólares.

En el marco del Proyecto se definieron los 6 departamentos que resultaron más afectados por inundaciones, en términos del impacto sobre los productores familiares: Canelones, Colonia, Río Negro, Rocha, San José y Soriano. Se trata de lugares con importante concentración de pequeños productores, en particular hortifruticultores y tamberos.

El Proyecto tenía dos componentes: por un lado asistencia y capacitación a productores familiares y por otro lado, sensibilización en escuelas rurales.

Para ejecutar el Proyecto SINAE y FAO convocaron al Ministerio de Ganadería, Agricultura y Pesca (MGAP) a través de la Dirección General de Desarrollo Rural (DGDR), a la Facultad de Agronomía de la Universidad de la República a través del Programa de Huertas en Centros Educativos, a la Dirección Nacional de Bomberos (DNB) y al Consejo de Educación Inicial y Primaria (CIEP). Los Gobiernos Departamentales, los Comités Departamentales de Emergencia y los Centros Coordinadores de Emergencias Departamentales (CECOED) de los 6 departamentos, también colaboraron.

“En nuestra región, las escenas de migrantes abandonados a su suerte en el desierto o en camiones hacinados en condiciones infrahumanas son frecuentes, y es muestra de que el tráfico ilícito está en su apogeo”, aseguró durante la presentación del manual, Antonino de Leo, representante de UNODC en México.

Durante la presentación del documento en la Ciudad de México, De Leo agregó que de acuerdo con datos de la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM), en el mundo hay 258 millones de migrantes quienes enfrentan situaciones atroces durante los desplazamientos que realizan.

Según el último reporte de la OIM de enero a noviembre de 2017 han muerto 5 mil 14 migrantes en tránsito a nivel mundial; especialistas en el tema advirtieron que el tráfico ilícito de migrantes es un negocio mortal que fortalece a la delincuencia organizada.

“Los migrantes y los refugiados enfrentan explotaciones y abusos atroces cuando huyen de los conflictos y las crisis económicas, muchos están tan desesperados que arriesgan sus vidas al cruzar mares salvajes y desiertos ardientes”, agregó De Leo.

Por su parte el director general adjunto para la ONU, de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE), Issac Morales, aseguró que para México, el tema de la migración y todo en torno al fenómeno migratorio es una prioridad, ello, debido a que este país es de salida, destino, transito y retorno de personas que, en su afán de buscar una mejor condición de vida, deciden emprender un viaje en el que muchas veces arriesgan su vida.

2381999,"“Guía de un sistema de alerta temprana para plagas de los cultivos:"" hacia una agricultura resiliente con seguridad y soberanía alimentaria **INTRODUCCION**

Un sistema de alerta temprana (SAT), es un conjunto de elementos relacionados entre sí que proveen información oportuna y eficaz a las personas y a las comunidades expuestas a una amenaza, y a las autoridades correspondientes para actuar con tiempo suficiente y de una manera apropiada, para reducir el riesgo de daño personal, pérdida de la vida, daño a sus propiedades y al medio ambiente.
Los sistemas SAT permiten avisar anticipadamente a la a los productores agropecuarios sobre las posibles amenazas de carácter natural, bióticas y físicas, para prepararse y tomar medidas requeridas de acuerdo al riesgo. Estos sistemas son ampliamente utilizados en la vigilancia y control de enfermedades y plagas de los cultivos.

Es imprescindible la generación y manejo de información oportuna que posibilite contar con sistemas de alerta temprana para anticipar medidas preventivas y de control de problemas fitosanitarios.
Existen múltiples aplicaciones informáticas disponibles para ser aplicadas, el punto crítico está en la oportunidad en cada una de las etapas y la capacidad de implementar respuestas frente a las alertas. Un sistema de alerta temprana requiere cuando menos los siguientes elementos: contar con indicadores detectables, tener mecanismos de detección de tales indicadores, contar con personal entrenado (sensores), contar con sistemas de análisis de datos y modelos de predicción de efectos, contar con un sistema de comunicación, contar con planes de contingencia y de respuesta rápida frente alertas, contar con personal entrenado y recursos técnicos y financieros para implementar dichos planes. 

En cuanto los indicadores detectables se pueden dividir en dos grandes grupos, aquellos asociados a la presencia de vectores o signos iniciales de la plaga (medidas de prevención secundaria y terciaria),
y/o indicadores clave de determinantes asociados y preferiblemente causales de la plaga (ambiente, agente y huésped) (medidas de prevención primaria).

Un Sistema SAT para plagas cuarentenarias y plagas de importancia económica, está relacionada a la cadena alimentaria humana que se ve constantemente amenazada por el creciente número de brotes de plagas ―incluidas las plagas y enfermedades de las especies forestales― y los problemas relacionados con la inocuidad alimentaria.

Contar con un Sistema SAT va a permitir al Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia poder atender los brotes de plagas y enfermedades cuarentenarias y de importancia económica, de manera eficiente y eficaz reduciendo el impacto medio ambiental mitigando el cambio climático. El propósito de este guía es ayudarte a controlar las plagas de los cultivos de una forma amigable con el ecosistema.

Ahora tendrán ustedes la información necesaria para ser parte de la solución a los problemas ambientales, sociales y desafíos económicos derivados de la depredación de los recursos naturales de nuestro planeta y por el uso de fertilizantes químico sintéticos, maquinaria, insecticidas, herbicidas y todo el arsenal de muerte que usa la agricultura convencional. Al adquirir un conocimiento, adquirimos responsabilidades.

Ahora ustedes comparten la responsabilidad de ayudar, cada quien en su ámbito y posibilidades, (principalmente los agrónomos) pero con un conocimiento y perspectiva globales. Su compromiso es mejorar esta situación y compartir sus conocimientos con quienes más lo necesiten.",269,"Spanish"

La Unidad para la Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas entregó infraestructura comunitaria y realizó seguimiento a proyectos productivos que beneficiaran a comunidades residentes en Miraflores, en el Guaviare, territorio que fue notificado este año como sujeto de reparación colectiva.

Miraflores se encuentra localizado aproximadamente a 150 km al suroriente de San José del Guaviare, capital del departamento, sobre la margen nororiental del Río Vaupés. El inicio a la ruta de reparación colectiva se viene realizando a través de fases que inician con el registro del sujeto colectivo, hasta la formulación por parte de las víctimas, y la implementación por parte de las entidades del Sistema Nacional de Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas, de un plan de reparación que será aprobado por el Comité Territorial de Justicia Transicional.

Dentro de las medidas de reparación, la entidad, viene adelantando acciones de mejoramiento de la infraestructura social con una inversión de $180 millones en materiales necesarios para la reconstrucción y adecuación del internado femenino “María Auxiliadora” y para el internado de la vereda Buenos Aires, otros $100 millones, escenarios que permitirán a 60 menores de edad gozar de mejores condiciones para su vida escolar. 

En las iniciativas productivas que benefician a más de 50 familias víctimas,  se ha entregado un total de $53 millones, representados en 8.000 alevinos, concentrado y adecuación de las zonas de producción.

Por su parte Víctor Sánchez, profesional de la entidad en el Guaviare, expresó que el proceso de articulación se lleva acabo con los gobiernos locales y la Mesa municipal de Víctimas, las acciones que se seguirán implementando obedecerán a estos procesos de concertación de los actores que hacen parte del proceso, obedeciendo a la construcción del plan de reparación colectiva, como lo establece la Ley de Víctimas.

Sánchez, destaca que el objetivo institucional es generar acciones que permitan resarcir el daño comunitario, que generó el conflicto armado en este territorio por varios años.

El director territorial para Meta y Llanos orientales, Carlos Pardo Alezones, afirma que este municipio contaba para el 2015 con 3.469 habitantes, de los cuales 622 se encuentran en el Registro Único de Víctimas.",269,"Spanish"
2381979,"OEA y OCDE presentan Informe sobre Migración Internacional en las Américas SICREMI 2017 **-Entre 2012 y 2015, 7,2 millones de personas dejaron su país en las Américas**

**- 48% emigraron a EEUU y Canadá; 34% a América Latina y Caribe; y 18% a Europa**

**- Barbados, Chile, Ecuador y Panamá, nuevos destinos emergentes para los migrantes**


La Organización de los Estados Americanos (OEA) y la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico (OCDE) presentaron hoy - en el marco de la celebración del “Día internacional del Migrante”- el “IV Informe del Sistema Continuo de Reportes sobre Migración Internacional en las Américas (SICREMI 2017)”.

El informe SICREMI 2017 (disponible [aquí)](http://www.oas.org/documents/spa/press/SICREMI-2017-espanol-web-FINAL.pdf) destaca los siguientes datos:

- Entre 2012 y 2015, de las 7,2 millones de personas que emigraron desde países de las Américas, el 48% se trasladaron hacia Canadá y Estados Unidos, 34% hacia América Latina y el Caribe y un 18% hacia países europeos de la OCDE. 

- En 2015, 880.000 personas provenientes de todo el mundo emigraron hacia países de América Latina y el Caribe lo que representa un 20% del total de emigración. Barbados, Chile, Ecuador y 

- Panamá se han establecido como los nuevos países emergentes de inmigración en las Américas. 
En los últimos 15 años, el número total de inmigrantes residentes en los países de América Latina y el Caribe, aumentó en 2,6 millones de personas, es decir un 45% y el número de inmigrantes residentes en los Estados Unidos aumentó en un 34% y en Europa en un 30%. 

- En 2015 hubo 184.000 solicitudes de asilo en las Américas, lo que representó un aumento del 83% con respecto a 2013. Esa cantidad representó el 6% de todas las solicitudes realizadas a nivel mundial, que aumentaron 187% en dicho periodo como resultado del conflicto armado en Siria, Afganistán e Irak. 

- Alrededor de un tercio de los inmigrantes de las Américas presentes en España entre 2002 y 2016 dejaron el país en 2015. Cerca de un 20% eran inmigrantes de la región del Caribe, y más del 40% eran inmigrantes de Bolivia, Brasil, Chile, México y Paraguay. 

- Entre 2014 y 2015 la situación laboral de los emigrantes de las Américas en Estados Unidos y Europa mejoró, lo que se reflejó en una disminución general del desempleo respecto a 2012/2013. No obstante la situación laboral de las mujeres migrantes sigue siendo más desfavorable que para los hombres. 

El estudio, presentado en la sede del organismo hemisférico en Washington, DC, resalta también que “en las Américas, como en otras partes del mundo, la emigración se ha visto incrementada  por el aumento del número de personas que escapan de sus países de origen, ya sea por catástrofes naturales, conflictos civiles, por inestabilidad económica, política y social o debido a las expectativas de la terminación de regulaciones que facilitan la inmigración a un determinado país, como el caso de haitianos, colombianos, venezolanos y cubanos respectivamente. Estas cuatro nacionalidades en 2015 representaron el 24% de toda la inmigración de América latina y el Caribe con 205.000 personas, número muy superior al total de población de varios Estados Miembros de la OEA”.

**El Secretario General Adjunto de la OEA, Nestor Mendez,** destacó que “hoy disponemos de evidencia abrumadora que confirma que la práctica del respeto y promoción de los derechos humanos y de las libertades fundamentales de los migrantes beneficia tanto a los migrantes como a los países de destino, tanto por el crecimiento de su economía como la cohesión social”. “Lamentablemente la violación de los derechos humanos de los migrantes es una realidad innegable. Los riesgos de muerte, la extorsión, la xenofobia, la trata y tráfico de personas, la separación de familias, el retorno forzado al país de origen, y la violencia ejercida por el crimen organizado, no son una realidad ajena a nuestro hemisferio. Es por eso que debemos seguir trabajando por un enfoque de derechos humanos en el abordaje de la migración y en el reconocimiento explícito de las contribuciones económicas y sociales que hacen los migrantes”, agregó.

Por su parte el **Jefe de la División de Migración Internacional de la OCDE, Jean-Christophe Dumont,** aseguró que el estudio SICREMI 2017 ayuda a “comprender la magnitud general de los movimientos migratorios a nivel regional, su naturaleza, su evolución en el tiempo y cómo se ven afectados por los cargos en la política”. Además de mostrar “la forma en que los inmigrantes trabajan y contribuyen a la economía y al mercado laboral, tanto en el país de destino como en el de origen” e “intenta monitorear y describir las políticas de migración e identificar los desafíos comunes en todos los países y la diferencia en términos de respuestas de política”.

Desde su inicio en 2009, el objetivo del proyecto SICREMI ha sido compilar, analizar y publicar estadísticas sobre migración internacional en el hemisferio occidental y en los países de las Américas hacia los países de la OCDE. La publicación muestra los cambios recientes en los movimientos y en las políticas migratorias en las Américas.

**SAN JACINTO**

La Unidad para las Víctimas y la Dirección de Asuntos para Comunidades Negras, Afrocolombianas, Raizales y Palenqueras del Ministerio del Interior, instalaron la pre-consulta y consulta previa con el Sujeto de Reparación Colectiva del Consejo Comunitario Eladio Ariza del corregimiento de San Cristobal, perteneciente al municipio de San Jacinto, Bolívar.

La instalación -que fue libre, informada y vinculante-, se cumplió los días 11 y 12 de diciembre de 2017 y contó con la participación de la Personería Municipal de San Jacinto y de la Asamblea General del Consejo Comunitario.

De esta manera, se avanza en el proceso de reparación colectiva con esta comunidad, que inició en octubre de 2014.

Yessica Duarte, gestora de la ruta étnica de la Unidad para las Victimas, destacó que el Consejo Comunitario Eladio Ariza “busca promover la incorporación y fortalecimiento de la identidad étnica y cultural en el proceso de reparación colectiva, a partir de los aprendizajes relacionados con los efectos del conflicto”.

“También, empoderar a sus habitantes, incidir en el diseño de las políticas públicas que impacten a la comunidad, la inclusión del enfoque étnico y aportar en la construcción de la memoria histórica. Además, de la adquisición de nuevos conocimientos que fomenten la innovación comunitaria, entre otros”.

El procedimiento de consulta previa se lleva a cabo en el marco de la ruta de reparación colectiva étnica y comprende la caracterización del daño y la formulación y protocolización del Plan Integral de Reparación Colectiva con Sujetos de Reparación Colectiva Étnicos.

El proceso --en el caso de los Sujetos de Reparación Colectiva Afrocolombianos, Palenqueros, Negros y Raizales-- inicia con la pre-consulta y culmina con la protocolización y firma del Plan Integral de Reparación Colectiva.

La consulta previa está contenida en el Artículo 205 de la Ley 1448 de 2011 y en el Convenio 169 de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo OIT, en particular en el Artículo 6, que fue ratificado en Colombia mediante la Ley 21 de 1991.

Finalmente, Melvis Ariza, representante legal del Consejo Comunitario, afirmó que “se construye paz respetando, principalmente, los derechos y acuerdos pactados desde el principio y la buena fe como personas y grupo étnico”.",269,"Spanish"

2381874,"En Valledupar se graduaron los primeros bachilleres del Modelo de Educación para la Reintegración El pasado 1 de diciembre de 2017, se realizó la primera ceremonia de graduación de 66 bachilleres del Modelo de Educación y Formación para la Reintegración, un modelo flexible dirigido a la población adulta y jóvenes que ha impactado a 50 municipios a nivel nacional y ha beneficiado ya, en sus cuatro ediciones, a más de 5.700 personas, incluyendo excombatientes en proceso de reintegración, víctimas y comunidad. Esta iniciativa busca resignificar el proyecto de vida de los estudiantes en búsqueda de su desarrollo personal y de quienes los rodean.

Cintya Ovalle es una de las 66 personas que recibieron en Valledupar su diploma de bachiller en la primera promoción de graduandos del Modelo de Educación y Formación para la Reintegración (MEFR). ""Para mí, ser bachiller significa dar un mejor porvenir a mis hijos y tener una mayor calidad de vida"", afirmó Cintya, quien había dejado de estudiar a los 17 años por empezar a trabajar y cuidar de su hija y volvio al aula de clase con este modelo que facilita los horarios de estudio.

Este modelo, que cuenta con el aval del Ministerio de Educación Nacional- y se construyó también con el SENA- potencia las habilidades de los estudiantes, resignifica sus proyectos de vida, promueve el acercamiento al sector empresarial mediante visitas pedagógicas, contribuye a la superación del analfabetismo de la población, permite fortalecer la calidad educativa para la población adulta y convierte las aulas en escenarios propicios para la paz y la convivencia. 

""Hoy esa meta que ustedes se trazaron de iniciar sus estudios hace unos años, hoy es una realidad"", les dijo Nelson Velandia, subdirector territorial de la ARN a los graduandos.

En su cuarta edición fue apoyado por la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional (USAID) y la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM), e implementado por la Fundación Alberto Merani, con el liderazgo de la Agencia para la Reincorporación y la Normalización (ARN), que hizo la entrega oficial del Modelo al Ministerio de Educación como un aporte a la educación de adultos del país. 

""Como entidad estamos orgullosos en este momento, haremos entrega oficial del modelo de educación para la reintegración al Ministerio de Educacion para que sea implementado en cualquier lugar donde hay necesidades para la educación de adultos"", dijo Lucas Uribe, director programatico de la ARN.

En 2017 el modelo benefició a aproximadamente 1.700 personas en los departamentos de La Guajira, Tolima, Antioquia, Urabá, Caquetá, Cauca, Cesar, Magdalena, Meta, Putumayo y Santander. 

Durante la ceremonia que tuvo lugar en Valledupar se graduaron estudiantes de municipios como El Copey, Bosconia, Aguachica, San Alberto y Fonseca. Y ademas sirvio de escenario para entregarles a cuatro reintegrados del municipio de Villa Germania el acto administrativo que acredita que culminaron su proceso de reintegracion.

""Cuando yo llegué a la ARN yo no era nadie, ahora soy un bachiller. Con compromiso he logrado todo eso. Gracias a todos los profesores y entidades"", dijo Gilberto Cruz, estudiante y persona en proceso de reintegración durante la ceremonia.

En diciembre más beneficiarios del modelo cumplirán su sueño de ser bachilleres en las ceremonias de graduación que se realizarán en los demás departamentos del territorio nacional.",269,"Spanish"

Los 20 albergues están distribuidos en todo el país y los últimos tres fueron instalados el jueves en Santa Catarina Pínula, Guatemala; Panajachel, Sololá; y Tacaná, San Marcos.

David de León, portavoz de la institución informó que el número de personas atendidas en los albergues ha disminuido pero que los esfuerzos se sostienen para aquellas que demanden este tipo de auxilio. Los albergues funcionan en horario de 17:00 a 8:00 horas del día siguiente.

En las últimas 24 horas se atendieron 117 personas a nivel nacional y 1.805 lo fueron desde el 23 de noviembre cuando se activó el protocolo por descenso de temperatura 2017-2018.

Aunque las condiciones de clima se estabilizan, “el Sistema Conred continuará el trabajo de brindar refugio a las personas que lo requieran”,  con los 20 albergues que tienen al servicio de la población guatemalteca, indicó el funcionario.

Eddy Sánchez, director del Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulcanología, Meteorología e Hidrología (Insivumeh), dijo que “las temperaturas propias de la época” y explicó que durante el fin de semana el clima será cálido y soleado, pero se prevé un frente frío débil la noche del domingo.

Las temperaturas mínimas serán de 14 grados en la capital y entre seis a ocho grados en el occidente, de acuerdo con el pronóstico de la institución.

“Esperamos que para mañana en la noche (domingo) ingrese un frente frío débil que no va a hacer descender las temperaturas considerablemente, solo se espera que se acelere el viento, no esperamos temperaturas tan bajas como se observaron recientemente”, precisó.

Recomendaciones:

– Abrigarse bien

– Cuidar a los niños y adultos mayores

– De conocer a alguna persona que requiera atención especial que lo reporten a los cuerpos de socorro o a la línea de emergencia de Conred 119.

– Asegurar los techos de lámina

– Por las mañana se podrá observar bancos de niebla en el altiplano y hay que tener precaución al manejar.

– A los agricultores, deberán hacer prácticas de limpieza de rastrojos, de ser posible implementar un poco de riego para que las temperaturas mínimas no afecten a sus cosechas.",269,"Spanish"
2381799,"Avanza entrega de materiales a personas afectadas en Villa Clara **El Consejo de Defensa provincial indicó que del total de viviendas afectadas se han solucionado más de 10 mil casos y hoy el Estado subsidia mil 860 créditos solicitados por familias damnificadas**

SANTA CLARA, diciembre 17.- Con prioridad para los derrumbes totales y parciales de techos de las viviendas damnificadas por el huracán Irma, Villa Clara avanza en la entrega de materiales de la construcción a las personas afectadas por ese evento meteorológico en el territorio.

En la provincia, la primera etapa de suministro de estos recursos transcurrió sin contratiempos, puesto que el país puso a disposición de la población todas sus reservas estatales y movilizativas.

Según información del Consejo de Defensa provincial, del total de viviendas afectadas se han solucionado más de 10 mil casos y hoy el Estado subsidia mil 860 créditos solicitados por las personas damnificadas, informó Cubadebate. 

Yoel Romero Hernández, especialista principal en ventas minoristas de la Empresa de Comercio de Villa Clara, detalló que se entregan principalmente módulos de zinc y en menor medida fibrocemento, cuya producción todavía resulta insuficiente.

El funcionario acotó que, además de la asignación de los niveles centrales, suministran también recursos las propias entidades de la provincia como la Empresa de Materiales de la Construcción, Mantenimiento Constructivo y la Empresa de Proyectos.

La entrega de cemento y bloques permanece estable y los destinos principales son los siete municipios costeros: Caibarién, Remedios, Sagua la Grande, Encrucijada, Camajuaní, Corralillo, Quemado de Güines y la capital provincial, precisó Romero Hernández.

El especialista de la Empresa de Comercio del territorio villaclareño, en el centro del país, indicó que también se destinan recursos al restablecimiento de las propias unidades suministradoras de materiales, puesto que varias de ellas fueron severamente dañadas por los vientos del huracán Irma.

René Pérez Naranjo, director de la Empresa de Construcción y Mantenimiento de Villa Clara, señaló que en localidades como la Panchita, perteneciente al municipio de Corralillo, se realiza la sustitución en viviendas de techos de canalones por otro de cubiertas más rígidas.",269,"Spanish"

La entrega simbólica de un donativo de la Organización Panamericana/Mundial de la Salud (OPS/OMS) con financiamiento del gobierno de la Federación Rusa; el cual está enmarcado dentro de la ayuda internacional movilizada debido a las afectaciones en el sistema de salud por el huracán Irma, el pasado mes de septiembre, tuvo lugar este viernes en el policlínico Camilo Cienfuegos, de La Habana del Este, de la capital.

Esta donación hace parte de un grupo de seis kits de emergencia compuesto por seis módulos básicos y un módulo suplementario, y contiene medicamentos e insumos básicos, material gastable, literatura médica en varios idiomas, así como guías de tratamientos de emergencia que prepara la OMS para responder a las necesidades de 10 000 personas por un periodo de tres meses. El valor estimado de los mismos es de 13 900 USD, con una cobertura para 1 000 personas aproximadamente.

Junto a este policlínico recibirán también estos kits los hospitales municipales de Cárdenas, Caibarién, Yaguajay, Morón y Nuevitas, que integran el conjunto de las comunidades más afectadas por el fenómeno meteorológico.

Así trascendió en el acto de entrega, que contó con la presencia del Embajador de la Federación Rusa, Excelentísimo Sr. Mikhail Kamynin, Cristian Morales Fuhriman, representante de la OPS en Cuba y Néstor Marimón, director de Relaciones Internacionales del Ministerio de Salud Pública, así como directivos y trabajadores de la institución.

El embajador Kamynin manifestó la satisfacción de Rusia de apoyar la iniciativa de la OMS de «prestar ayuda al servicio médico cubano luego del horrible huracán Irma, que causó bastante daños».

«Estamos aquí ahora entregando una parte simbólica de esa ayuda médica de urgencia, que fue enviada a través de la OMS con la financiación rusa. Esperamos que este aporte ayude al Minsap a recuperar todos los servicios necesarios, y a que la población de esas zonas tenga lo necesario.

«Rusia ha estado y estará junto al pueblo cubano en los momentos más difíciles», refirió el embajador, quien agradeció a la OMS/OPS y también al Minsap.

Destacó además la cooperación entre nuestros países en el área de la sanidad, y como muestra de que esas relaciones son fantásticas recordó que recientemente el ministro cubano de salud pública regresó de Moscú, donde sostuvo conversaciones con la ministra de ese país y autoridades de salud rusas, y visitó varios centros docentes, hospitales y policlínicos.

Por su parte, el representante de OPS en Cuba resaltó el nivel de preparación y de respuesta del Minsap, «que de manera ejemplar permitió que no se discontinuaran las atenciones a la población ni antes, ni durante ni después del paso del devastador huracán Irma.

«Por cierto, también es el momento de resaltar la generosidad de la Federación Rusa que aportó los fondos necesarios para movilizar estos kits que son previamente preparados por la OMS y se encuentran en un almacén para que, en caso de necesidad, se despliegan hacia los países».

Morales Fuhriman  refirió que hace menos de un mes tuvo el honor de acompañar a la directora de la OPS, Dra Carissa Etienne, a una misión en la Federación Rusa, donde se firmó un memorándum de entendimiento para que la OPS y Rusia colaboren en pos de la salud de todos los pueblos de las Américas.

«Esperamos que este convenio permita que los países de nuestra región, incluyendo a Cuba, puedan beneficiarse de los avances de Rusia en tecnologías y otros ámbitos, como de hecho ya lo está haciendo, por ejemplo Nicaragua, con la construcción de una planta productora de vacunas anti influenza, en asociación con el Instituto de Inmunizaciones de St. Petersburgo, y en donde el Centro para el Control Estatal de Medicamentos, Equipos y Dispositivos Médicos (Cecmed), de Cuba, ha jugado un rol clave en la certificación de los procesos productivos y la preparación de la autoridad reguladora de Nicaragua», dijo.

«Son muchos los temas donde esperamos desarrollar esta colaboración», precisó el representante de OPS, y entre estos mencionó las enfermedades transmisibles, como la eliminación de la tuberculosis y la lucha contra las arbovirosis; la telemedicina y el apoyo al despliegue de tecnologías reforzando el primer nivel de atención, en el marco de un modelo de asistencia, similar al cubano, centrado en las personas, las familias y las comunidades.

También, el manejo integrado de las Enfermedades crónicas no transmisibles, la adaptación de los sistemas de salud a las necesidades de las personas mayores, y la preparación y respuesta a emergencias y brotes epidémicos.

«Estoy seguro que esta nueva relación nos beneficiará a todos: en Rusia, en las Américas y en Cuba», destacó.

Para el director de Relaciones Internacionales del Ministerio de Salud Pública, este acto es una muestra más de lo que Rusia ha hecho, y estamos seguros seguirá haciendo por la gran amistad y hermandad entre nuestros pueblos y gobiernos.

Reconoció que tanto Rusia como la OPS son ejemplos de cooperación con Cuba, siempre han estado junto a nosotros y fundamentalmente en los momentos más difíciles.

«Cuba está acostumbrada a responder a todos los hermanos del mundo cuando ocurre una catástrofe, cuando se necesita, ante una emergencia, enviando medicamentos, sus brigadas médicas, su capital más preciado que son nuestros hombres y mujeres, y lo hacemos desinteresadamente. Por eso valoramos mucho estos momentos, porque conocemos los valores y los principios de la solidaridad», destacó.",269,"Spanish"
2381744,"Comunicado de la Secretaría General de la OEA sobre las elecciones en Honduras 17 de diciembre de 2017

El Secretario General de la Organización de los Estados Americanos (OEA), Luis Almagro, hace un expreso llamado a la paz y la convivencia civilizada en Honduras, al tiempo que hace suyas las denuncias y conclusiones de la Misión de Observación Electoral de la Organización (MOE/OEA) en Honduras, hechas públicas hoy. 

La labor de dicha Misión para asegurar las mejores condiciones electorales y hacer sostenible la democracia en Honduras ha sido encomiable.

Sus observaciones, basadas en el conocimiento técnico y la experiencia acumulada de observación de elecciones en el continente, han dado solución a los problemas e irregularidades más graves que este proceso electoral ha planteado.

Las soluciones propuestas se han afirmado en la responsabilidad y compromiso que debemos tener siempre con los instrumentos del Sistema Interamericano.

La democracia se construye en la certeza del genuino respeto a la expresión de la voluntad popular en el Estado de Derecho.

Es por ello, que habiendo recibido el [informe preliminar de la Misión de Observación Electoral en Honduras](https://reliefweb.int/report/honduras/segundo-informe-preliminar-de-la-misi-n-de-observaci-n-electoral-de-la-oea-en), así como el informe relativo al cumplimiento de las etapas recomendadas para el proceso de verificación, la Secretaría General de la OEA no puede dar certeza respecto al resultado de las elecciones celebradas el 26 de noviembre.

Como ya fue informado por la MOE, el proceso electoral estuvo caracterizado por irregularidades y deficiencias cuya entidad permite calificarlo como de muy baja calidad técnica y carente de integridad.

Intrusiones humanas deliberadas en el sistema informático, eliminación intencional de rastros digitales, imposibilidad de conocer el número de oportunidades en que el sistema fue vulnerado, valijas de votos abiertas o sin actas, improbabilidad estadística extrema respecto a los niveles de participación dentro del mismo departamento, papeletas de voto en estado de reciente impresión e irregularidades adicionales, sumadas a la estrecha diferencia de votos entre los dos candidatos más votados, hacen imposible determinar con la necesaria certeza al ganador.

El pueblo hondureño merece un ejercicio electoral que le brinde calidad democrática y garantías. El ciclo electoral que el TSE dio por cerrado hoy, claramente no lo ha sido.

Por todo lo explicado, y ante la imposibilidad de determinar un ganador, el único camino posible para que el vencedor sea el pueblo de Honduras es un nuevo llamado a elecciones generales, dentro del marco del más estricto respeto al Estado de Derecho, con las garantías de un TSE que goce de la capacidad técnica y de la confianza de la ciudadanía y los partidos políticos.

La paz y la concordia de los hondureños es el valor principal. Y respetar los valores democráticos y ciudadanos es el camino necesario para preservar a la sociedad de la muerte y la violencia.

La Secretaria General de la OEA hace un llamado explícito e inequívoco a todas las partes a evitar la violencia.

Es necesario reconstruir los canales del diálogo político sin crispación ni sectarismo.

Es la vocación permanente de la Secretaría General de la OEA acompañar a Honduras en este camino. Es por ello que he decidido designar como Representantes Especiales para llevar a cabo los trabajos necesarios para un nuevo proceso electoral y reconciliación democrática nacional en Honduras a los ex Presidentes Jorge Quiroga y Alvaro Colom.

Solicito a todas las partes el apoyo al trabajo de los ex Presidentes. Estoy convencido de que es el camino necesario para que los hondureños vivan en paz democrática y avancen en el camino de la prosperidad compartida.

No hay tarea más importante para esta Secretaría General que promover, proteger y velar por los derechos de la gente de las Américas.

Es el mismo camino consistente e imparcial que la Secretaría General desarrolla en todo el continente y, en forma indeclinable, reafirma que esos principios y valores deben ser el eje cardinal que guíe nuestros esfuerzos en Honduras.

Como hemos señalado, “en todos los países del continente la democracia es perfectible, y en tal sentido la cooperación entre los países miembros y entre la Secretaría General es la herramienta principal que los instrumentos jurídicos del Sistema Interamericano proponen para el fortalecimiento de su ejercicio efectivo en el continente”.

No se debe mentir respecto a los esfuerzos que ha realizado la OEA en este proceso y que no son ni declarar ganador a Juan Orlando Hernandez (como se ha dicho) ni declarar ganador a Salvador Nasralla como se ha senalado hoy, sino respetar el derecho al sufragio y el derecho a elegir del pueblo hondureno que es el único perdedor en una jornada como la de hoy. 

No existen condiciones para afirmar que el ganador es uno u otro, y ello demuestra que este proceso se ha visto afectado por marcadas irregularidades y deficiencias, por la violencia de unos y otros antes, durante y despues del acto eleccionario, se ha visto afectado por actores externos e internos que han apostado a la desestabilizacion, se ha visto afectado por la falta de garantias previas y post acto electoral y se ha visto afectado por la corrupción que rodea al sistema político hondureno. 

Las denuncias realizadas son de especial gravedad, las mismas impiden otorgar ninguna certeza al resultado de este proceso electoral. 

El pueblo hondureño no merece actitudes ni pronunciamientos irresponsables, merece las máximas garantías.

Por incidencia POR LLUVIAS Y TORMENTAS ELECTRICAS moderadas a temporalmente fuertes en ALERTA NARANJA emitida por el SENAMHI en el aviso Nº 51, existe riesgo de afectación a la actividad agrícola provocando desbordes de ríos en las regiones vulnerables descritas. 

De mantenerse estas condiciones de LLUVIAS Y TORMENTAS ELECTRICAS, la actividad agrícola y ganadera podría ser afectada, principalmente las crías y ganado gestante.  

Existe riesgo de encharcamientos ya que el suelo en los sectores de la alerta en el departamento de Santa Cruz, ya tenían bastante humedad acumulada en el suelo, este encharcamiento también podría ocasionar hipoxia en las zonas ya sembradas, sin embargo en las zonas agrícolas donde se tenía déficit de precipitaciones estas lluvias ayudaran en un balance hídrico agrícola positivo.  

**RECOMENDACIÓN DE ACCIONES PREVENTIVAS:** 

 Las Unidades de Gestión de Riesgo (UGRs) deben realizar acciones de prevención y preparación en comunidades recurrentes a inundaciones, riadas y otras regiones cercanas a las emitidas en las alertas altamente vulnerables y expuestas a riadas e inundaciones. 

Se recomienda No exponer al ganado mayor y menor en áreas de riadas e inundaciones, debido al riesgo que representa, además existe riesgo de pérdida de rendimiento y disminución de producción de leche. 

Es recomendable la aplicación de buenas prácticas agropecuarias en los probables escenarios de afectación por inundaciones y riadas con la disponibilidad de forraje y agua para la alimentación preventiva del ganado.

El MEFR es modelo educativo flexible dirigido a población adulta y jóvenes que ha impactado a 50 municipios a nivel nacional y ha beneficiado ya, en sus cuatro ediciones, a más de 5.700 personas, incluyendo excombatientes en proceso de reintegración, víctimas y comunidad. Esta iniciativa busca resignificar el proyecto de vida de los estudiantes en búsqueda de su desarrollo personal y de quienes los rodean.

El pasado 2 de diciembre de 2017, 23 personas de Villa Germania, Cesar, recibieron su diploma, que los acredita como bachilleres. Mujeres y hombres, entre los 17 y 70 años, quienes no habían tenido la oportunidad de cursar sus estudios.

Este modelo, que cuenta con el aval del Ministerio de Educación Nacional- y se construyó también con el SENA- potencia las habilidades de los estudiantes, resignifica sus proyectos de vida, promueve el acercamiento al sector empresarial mediante visitas pedagógicas, contribuye a la superación del analfabetismo de la población, permite fortalecer la calidad educativa para la población adulta y convierte las aulas en escenarios propicios para la paz y la convivencia.

Asimismo, instruí dar orientaciones a los funcionarios encargados de aplicar la ley (policía) sobre sus obligaciones de respeto a los derechos humanos, en particular de reunión y manifestación pacífica y sin armas; acompañar a las manifestaciones pacíficas; y mediar, cuando ello fuera solicitado, entre otras acciones.

A continuación, un resumen de actuaciones del CONADEH en los dieciocho (18) departamentos de la República.

**En cuanto al “Toque de queda”**

En la situación del toque de queda, para prevenir actos de violencia o represión injustificada, recomendé el respeto a las personas que ejercen su derecho a la reunión y manifestación pacífica y el CONADEH actuó en función de ello.

Por lo anterior, condené toda actitud y comportamiento de violencia realizada, a nivel nacional, en perjuicio de las personas y la propiedad, por ser antidemocráticas y contrarias a la dignidad humana. Condené también todo acto de represión desproporcionado realizado por las autoridades, y recomendé su pronta investigación, sanción y su no repetición.

Como Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos, presenté también observaciones y recomendaciones urgentes para modificar los criterios y alcances del Decreto Ejecutivo que instauró el toque de queda en lo que amenaza los derechos humanos de la población.

**Acompañamiento y monitoreo de manifestaciones**

Desde el inicio de las manifestaciones, posterior al día de las elecciones llevadas a cabo el 26 de noviembre a la fecha, el CONADEH brindó acompañamiento y monitoreo a 60 manifestaciones, a nivel nacional, con el objeto de garantizar que la ciudadanía ejerciera su derecho constitucional a la protesta pública y pacífica, tutelando el cumplimiento de los derechos humanos a la vida e integridad física respetando las libertades fundamentales

Asimismo, el CONADEH realizó acciones defensoriales, tanto de oficio como a petición de parte, y medió en numerosas manifestaciones entre manifestantes y autoridades locales, generando un diálogo entre las partes, hasta lograr que las autoridades cumplieran con su mandato apegado al respeto de los derechos humanos, y que las manifestaciones públicas se realizaran de forma pacífica.

**Personas detenidas en horarios durante el toque de queda**

Se verificó, por medio de las oficinas departamentales y regionales, un total de 1,675 personas detenidas dentro de los horarios establecidos por el “Toque de Queda”, en fechas del 1 al 5 de diciembre de 2017, constatando que las mismas fueron puestas en libertad, en los términos establecidos en la ley.

Es importante mencionar que, como parte de la labor del CONADEH, se realizó acciones en defensa de los derechos de los habitantes, en centros de detención, logrando la liberación de personas detenidas, en especial jóvenes y niños, que no habían cometido delitos.

**Personas Lesionadas**

El CONADEH inspeccionó los centros de salud y hospitales a nivel nacional verificando que las personas que ingresaron con lesiones durante las manifestaciones y desalojos recibieron atención médica oportuna. En varios casos, se remitió a medicina forense, para su respectiva evaluación, a personas que resultaron lesionadas en ocasión de las manifestaciones.

**Personas Fallecidas**

Se constató, por medio del registro de las oficinas departamentales y regionales, un total de 16 personas que perdieron su vida, durante el periodo post electoral, por causas y actores por determinar, e iniciamos de oficio las investigaciones e instamos a las autoridades competentes para el esclarecimiento de los hechos suscitados y la debida deducción de responsabilidad de los autores, para evitar su impunidad. El CONADEH, a nivel nacional, da seguimiento a cada uno de dichos casos.

**Registro, atención e investigación de quejas de oficio en casos relacionados con denuncias de violencia de la libre expresión del pensamiento**. El CONADEH inició investigaciones de oficio, en el periodo post elecciones generales, en los casos de medios de comunicación que denunciaron públicamente acciones en contra de su libertad de expresión, tales como Une Tv, Villavisión, Canal 11 y Radio Progreso, realizando diligencias, ante las autoridades competentes, conducentes a investigaciones y medidas encaminadas a proteger el ejercicio efectivo de sus derechos.

El CONADEH se encuentra al servicio de cualquier otro medio de comunicación y comunicadores que se sientan amenazados o afectados en sus derechos fundamentales.

**Conclusión y recomendaciones del CONADEH**

Hemos realizado y continuamos haciendo una serie de consideraciones, posicionamientos y recomendaciones, a nivel nacional, exhortando a todas las autoridades a afirmar el Estado democrático de Derecho, cumpliendo con su obligación de garantizar los derechos y libertades fundamentales y el goce de los mismos por la población.

Entre otras consideraciones, posicionamientos y recomendaciones, están los siguientes:

- Aplicación de protocolos de respeto a los derechos humanos en manifestaciones y desalojos;  
- Utilización del diálogo democrático sustentado en el respeto a la dignidad humana de todas y todos los habitantes, y rechazo a cualquier forma de violencia entre manifestantes y autoridades, y al menoscabo de derechos humanos de terceros;  
- Facilitación, a las partes, de mediación del CONADEH para garantizar entre ellas las manifestaciones pacíficas; así como el respeto de los derechos de los demás.  
- Respeto a la libertad de expresión, respeto a la institucionalidad pública y a los funcionarios encargados de aplicar la ley, al derecho al debido proceso y a la presunción de inocencia de los habitantes;  
Lo anterior ha sido comunicado, a las autoridades del Estado y la población, directamente o por medio de los delegados departamentales y regionales.

Lamento la violencia y condeno la muerte y lesión de personas, así como daños a la propiedad y obstáculos al ejercicio de derechos humanos a terceros, y he solicitado a las autoridades correspondientes una investigación y sanción pronta y exhaustiva de estos hechos contrarios a la protección y respeto de la dignidad humana.

Llamo a todos los sectores de la población a evitar los actos violencia y a las autoridades a evitar actos de represión. A todos y todas exhorto a la paz, armonía social, dialogo y solución pacífica de nuestras diferencias.

2381359,"La OIM y Alemania lanzan el primer Portal de Datos sobre la Migración Mundial **Berlín —** La Oficina Federal de Asuntos Exteriores de Alemania y el Centro de Análisis de Datos de la OIM sobre la Migración Mundial (GMDAC), procederán a lanzar en Berlín en el día de hoy (15/12) el Portal de Datos Migratorios. Dicho Portal reúne en un mismo lugar y por primera vez todos los hechos y cifras claves acerca de las tendencias mundiales en materia migratoria. 

“Es especialmente en momentos críticos, tales como los que se viven en la actualidad, que nuestra tarea consiste en asegurar que las respuestas a la migración estén basadas en hechos sólidos y en un análisis preciso,” sostuvo el Director General de la OIM William Lacy Swing.

La idea de desarrollar un portal de esa naturaleza fue discutida y acordada por primera vez el 12 de julio de 2016, en ocasión de la 2° Mesa Redonda sobre Refugiados y Migración, en la que el anterior Ministro de Asuntos Exteriores de Alemania se reunió con los jefes de organizaciones internacionales que trabajan en el área de la migración, entre ellas la OIM, el ACNUR, la Federación Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, la Comisión Europea y el Banco Mundial. El Portal ha sido desarrollado por la OIM con el apoyo de la Unidad de Inteligencia del Economista (EIU por su sigla en inglés).

El Portal de Datos Migratorios fue desarrollado con el apoyo financiero del Departamento de Estado y de la Oficina Federal de Asuntos Exteriores de Alemania.

El portal comunica datos mundiales sobre migración por medio de visualizaciones, infografías y videos. Simplifica la navegación por medio de datos migratorios internacionales complejos para legisladores, periodistas, personas que trabajan con estadísticas y cualquier interesado en temas migratorios.

El portal cubre asimismo una amplia gama de temas entre los cuales se incluyen datos sobre tendencias en inmigración y emigración; los vínculos entre migración y desarrollo; datos sobre migración irregular; estudiantes y niños; y datos sobre políticas migratorias tal como son definidas por los Objetivos de Desarrollo de Naciones Unidas y por los antecedentes del Pacto Mundial sobre Migración cuya adopción por la ONU está prevista para 2018.

En esta etapa inicial, el portal incluye 70 indicadores procedentes de 15 proveedores internacionales de datos (Departamento de Asuntos Económicos y Sociales de las Naciones Unidas, ACNUR, Banco Mundial, entre otros) y agrega datos a nivel nacional, regional y mundial. Esta variedad permite amplias oportunidades de explorar y de comparar datos a la par que se comprende el contexto subyacente a tales datos.

“En un momento en el que la migración es un tema prioritario en la agenda global, es esencial que todos tengan acceso a los datos y cifras claves sobre la migración, y que comprendamos mejor las fortalezas y debilidades de tales datos,” sostuvo Frank Laczko, Director del Centro de Análisis de Datos de la OIM sobre la Migración Mundial.

La política exterior de Alemania hace uso de una estrategia coherente para gestionar los movimientos migratorios de manera más eficiente y para atacar las causas de origen de la migración forzada. Para que existan políticas y respuestas basadas en hechos, la existencia de datos confiables es vital para asegurar una asistencia humanitaria eficiente y basada en las necesidades, para descartar conjeturas dañinas y para combatir el populismo.

El desarrollo del Portal de Datos Migratorios es un gran paso en pos de mejorar la gran cantidad de datos existentes sobre la migración y para garantizar que los mismos estén al alcance de los legisladores.

En los meses venideros, el Portal de Datos Migratorios se agrandará y se podrá disponer de  más datos a nivel regional y nacional. Puede visitar el Portal de Datos Migratorios a través del siguiente vínculo: www.migrationdataportal.org

2381294,"Sequía en Sahel: el análisis de biomasa anuncia una grave crisis en Mauritania y Senegal **SE PREVÉ MÁS DE 600 000 PERSONAS EN SITUACIÓN DE CRISIS ALIMENTARIA EN 2018 EN MAURITANIA Y MÁS DE 548.000 EN SENEGAL (LA MITAD EN EL NORTE DEL PAÍS).**

“Ha llovido poco y además las precipitaciones han estado mal distribuidas en el espacio y en el tiempo. La situación de los pastores nómadas se ha deteriorado rápidamente. Los pocos pastizales disponibles se están secando rápidamente y mucho antes de lo previsto, lo que genera una fuerte concentración animal en los exiguos pastos y empuja a una gran parte de ellos a una trashumancia precoz hacia Senegal y Malí” explicaba Elena Vicario, directora país de Acción contra el Hambre en Mauritania en un encuentro informativo esta mañana.

Además, el fracaso de las cosechas han provocado ya un aumento de precios en los mercados locales, a la vez que el precio del ganado está bajando drásticamente.

Según los últimos datos de las organizaciones humanitarias presentes sobre el terreno 378.000 personas se encuentran ya en situación de crisis (fase 3 de las 5 fases con las que la comunidad internacional clasifica las crisis alimentarias) y más de 600.000 personas podrían encontrarse en fase  3 y 4 en junio de 2018. “Es muy importante destacar que si todo sigue igual la estación del hambre, que normalmente dura de junio a septiembre, adelantaría su inicio en 2018 a marzo, con lo que duraría siete meses en lugar de tres”, añadía Vicario.

“En Senegal la situación está más localizada en la zona norte del país, pero queda diluida en las cifras nacionales, bastante positivas para el año, lo que invisibiliza la situación de un millón de personas”, apuntaba por su parte Fabrice Carbonne, responsable de Acción contra el Hambre en el país.  “Es la tercera sequía en los últimos seis años en la zona más vulnerable del país. De hecho esta región no se ha recuperado aún de la crisis de 2011 y supera anulamente los umbrales de emergencia para la desnutrición aguda severa”, añadió. 

En el corto plazo podemos esperar un aumento de la mortalidad animal y una competición creciente por los recursos naturales. A medio plazo se elevarían los conflictos entre agricultores y pastores ya que los rebaños de estos últimos podrían entrar en zonas de cultivo. También disminuirán los productos animales, una fuente de proteínas indispensable para gran parte de la población de Sahel.

**ALERTA TEMPRANA: PODEMOS EVITAR LO PEOR**

El análisis de biomasa con imágenes tomadas desde satélite es una de las piezas claves del sistema de alerta temprana de Acción contra el Hambre. La biomasa es la materia seca vegetal presente en el suelo que sirve de pasto en una región en la que los pastores y agropastores representan el 30% de la población y el 40% del Producto Interior Bruto.  Este indicador, junto a otros como el precio de intercambio del ganado o la evolución de los productos básicos en los mercados permiten anticipar (y evitar si se ponen los medios necesarios para ello) crisis alimentarias que pueden afectar masivamente a la región, especialmente a los niños y niñas menores de cinco años.

Acción contra el Hambre hace un llamamiento a las agencias humanitarias y a los donantes para mitigar los efectos de esta crisis y reforzar la seguridad alimentaria y el acceso al tratamiento nutricional hasta la cosecha de septiembre de 2018.",269,"Spanish"

El segundo informe preliminar de la Misión de Observación Electoral de la OEA para las elecciones generales en Honduras está disponible completo [aquí](http://www.oas.org/fpdb/press/Segundo-Informe-Preliminar-MOE-Honduras-18dic-FINAL.pdf).

A continuación se reproducen las conclusiones del Informe:

_Conclusiones_

En el informe preliminar presentado el 4 de diciembre, la MOE/OEA señaló irregularidades, errores y problemas sistémicos observados antes, durante y después del 26 de noviembre. Algunas de estas eran:

ANTES del 26 de noviembre: las acusaciones de partidización del órgano electoral; la entrega de credenciales partidarias sin nombre a partidos con escasa votación real; el cambio del proveedor del sistema de transmisión y procesamiento poco antes de la elección, además del simulacro tardío y limitado del SIEDE; y la utilización de una mala práctica, una sentencia judicial para habilitar la reelección presidencial, lo que revivió la polarización generada por el golpe y la crisis política del 2009.

DURANTE la jornada electoral: el uso de encuestas de boca de urna como elementos de propaganda antes que información; el horario confuso de cierre de mesas, que aunque formalmente legal fue inusual y dejó gente en colas de votación; la falta de transmisión de datos oficiales hasta la 1:30 am del día siguiente; y la transmisión de sólo el 64% de las actas por la vía ATX.

DESPUÉS de la jornada electoral: la paralización de la transmisión de actas en línea el día lunes 27 de noviembre; el manejo de actas en el INFOP sin protocolos, con maletas sin custodios, abiertas o incompletas; la alteración del orden de carga y despacho de actas que no fue aleatorio; y la caída del servidor durante varias horas el día miércoles 29 de noviembre.

Por todo esto, además del estrecho margen de los resultados, la MOE/OEA informó que no tenía certeza sobre los resultados y recomendó los seis pasos detallados en este segundo Informe Preliminar.

La Misión agradece el reporte entregado por el TSE con información sobre la implementación de las actividades recomendadas por la MOE/OEA. Asimismo, es importante destacar que durante las últimas dos semanas los expertos de la Misión observaron de manera directa los procedimientos llevados a cabo. 

En relación con la revisión y el cotejo de actas, la MOE/OEA consideró como positivo que el TSE decidiera que se contaran todas las boletas.

En el contexto de la observación post electoral, la MOE analizó un importante número de actas correspondientes al SIEDE y escrutinios especiales, así como a las fuerzas políticas en contienda (Partido Nacional, Partido Liberal y la Alianza de Oposición contra la Dictadura y el Partido Liberal). De esta revisión, la MOE puede concluir que en casi la totalidad de las actas hay coincidencia entre las oficiales y las obtenidas por los partidos. Sin embargo, existen algunos casos en los que se encontraron discrepancias inexplicables entre las actas de los tres partidos y las del TSE. Es importante notar que las copias de las actas en posesión de los partidos no cuentan con las medidas de seguridad para evitar su alteración o falsificación.

Sobre la revisión de la participación en los departamentos de Lempira, Intibucá, y La Paz, la MOE observó que los niveles coinciden con los datos históricos. Sumado a esto, vale resaltar que el TSE entregó a la MOE/OEA el listado con la información sobre los ciudadanos que participaron como miembros MER en los departamentos de Atlántida, Colón, Cortés, Francisco Morazán, y Yoro.

A partir del análisis técnico realizado, la Misión no puede confirmar que el SIEDE haya sido manipulado con dolo. Sin embargo, sí puede afirmar que no contó con las robustas medidas de seguridad necesarias para garantizar su integridad y que, por tanto, su seguridad se vio vulnerada.

A partir del análisis presentado en este reporte y del cúmulo de observaciones comprendidas en el primer informe preliminar, la MOE considera que ha observado un proceso de baja calidad electoral y por ende no puede afirmar que las dudas sobre el mismo estén hoy esclarecidas.

La Misión lamenta, una vez más, los incidentes de violencia ocurridos en las distintas fases del proceso electoral y llama a todos los actores a mantener la calma y actuar con responsabilidad.

2379609,"El Niño/La Niña Hoy - Diciembre de 2017 **Situación actual y perspectivas((

**Recientemente, las temperaturas de la superficie del mar en la parte oriental del Pacífico tropical se han enfriado hasta alcanzar unas condiciones características de un episodio débil de La Niña. De igual modo, la mayoría de los indicadores atmosféricos coinciden ahora con los correspondientes a las primeras fases de un episodio de La Niña. Los modelos climáticos indican que es probable que esas condiciones de La Niña se mantengan hasta el primer trimestre de 2018. Es menos probable que se vuelva a unas condiciones neutras de El Niño-Oscilación del Sur (ENOS) antes de principios de 2018 y parece muy remota la posibilidad de que se produzca un episodio de El Niño antes del segundo trimestre de 2018. Los Servicios Meteorológicos e Hidrológicos Nacionales seguirán supervisando de cerca la evolución del fenómeno ENOS en los próximos meses.**

Desde octubre, en gran parte del Pacífico tropical las temperaturas de la superficie del mar han pasado de unos niveles neutros a unas condiciones características de un episodio débil de La Niña, con temperaturas situadas entre 0,5 y 1,0 grados Celsius por debajo de lo normal en las partes oriental y central de la cuenca. Los indicadores atmosféricos muestran también las características típicas de La Niña, entre ellas un aumento de las precipitaciones sobre el extremo occidental del Pacífico y una reducción de las mismas cerca de la línea internacional de cambio de fecha. Al mismo tiempo, se observa un recrudecimiento de los vientos alisios en la parte occidental del Pacífico tropical y una presión al nivel del mar más alta de lo normal en el Pacífico oriental y más baja de lo normal en la parte occidental, siendo ambos elementos característicos de La Niña.  

Desde el centro hasta la parte oriental del Pacífico las aguas profundas han permanecido un poco más frías de lo normal desde octubre, hasta unos cientos de metros por debajo de la superficie. Esas aguas, que a menudo dan indicios de cuáles van a ser las condiciones en superficie, no indican que se vaya a dar ninguna subida de las temperaturas de la superficie del mar, actualmente más frías de lo normal, durante diciembre ni enero.  
Según la mayoría de los modelos considerados, las temperaturas de la superficie del mar en las partes central y oriental del Pacífico tropical pueden enfriarse todavía más a lo largo de los dos próximos meses, pero sus valores seguirán siendo cercanos a los de un episodio débil de La Niña (entre 0,5 y 1,0 grados Celsius por debajo de lo normal). Un pequeño número de modelos predice que se va a producir un enfriamiento de más de 1,0 grados Celsius por debajo de la media. Teniendo en cuenta estas predicciones y las opiniones de los expertos, la probabilidad de que el fenómeno de La Niña se prolongue durante el primer trimestre de 2018 se sitúa entre el 70 y el 80 %. No existe prácticamente ninguna posibilidad de que se vaya a formar un episodio de El Niño antes del segundo trimestre de 2018.  

Es importante tener en cuenta que El Niño y La Niña no son los únicos factores que condicionan las características climáticas a escala mundial, y que la intensidad del ENOS no se corresponde sistemáticamente con la de los efectos.  

Por lo que se refiere a la escala regional, las proyecciones estacionales deberán tener en cuenta los efectos relativos tanto del estado del fenómeno El Niño/Oscilación del Sur como de otros condicionantes climáticos pertinentes a escala local. Por ejemplo, se sabe que la temperatura de la superficie del océano Índico, del sureste del Pacífico y del Atlántico tropical influye también en el clima de las zonas terrestres adyacentes. A escala regional y local puede encontrarse información aplicable en las predicciones climáticas estacionales regionales o nacionales, tales como las Diciembre de 2017 elaboradas por los Centros Regionales sobre el Clima (CRC) de la Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM), los Foros Regionales sobre la Evolución Probable del Clima (FREPC) y los Servicios Meteorológicos e Hidrológicos Nacionales (SMHN).",269,"Spanish"
2378659,"Colombia – Desplazamiento masivo y restricciones a la movilidad en Magüí Payán (Nariño)
Flash Update No. 2 (15/12/17) Como consecuencia del enfrentamiento ocurrido el 27 de noviembre en zona rural del municipio de Magüi Payán (Flash Update No.1), hasta el martes 12 de diciembre llegaron a la cabecera municipal unas 138 personas (42 familias) sumándose a las 71 desplazadas inicialmente. El censo registra un total de 209 personas (49 niñas, 45 niños, 60 mujeres y 55 hombres) pertenecientes a comunidades afrocolombianas. Se prevé que el número de personas siga aumentando por la presencia de los actores armados, control social y riesgo de nuevos enfrentamientos. Esta situación ha llevado a que las comunidades adopten mecanismos de autoprotección restringiendo su movilidad y las actividades de sustento diario, como recolección de productos de pan coger y la pesca.  

La alcaldía municipal estima que son aproximadamente 1.200 personas las que continúan con restricciones a la movilidad, pertenecientes a las comunidades expulsoras y veredas aledañas.  
Según información preliminar suministrada por autoridades locales, las personas en situación de desplazamiento se encuentran albergadas en casas de familiares, amigos y en la Institución Educativa Liceo Payán. La Alcaldía manifiesta no contar con los recursos suficientes para continuar con la atención a la población afectada y ha identificado necesidades en seguridad alimentaria y nutricional, agua y saneamiento básico, salud mental y física. Se solicita apoyo con kits de alimentos, hábitat, aseo y de cocina.  

**Respuesta:**    
Desde el 29 de noviembre, se estableció una ruta institucional para la respuesta articulada entre la administración municipal, la gobernación de Nariño, la Unidad para la Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas (UARIV) y el ELC de Nariño como proceso de complementariedad, atendiendo a las 18 primeras familias que salieron en situación de desplazamiento. A partir del 15 de diciembre, la UARIV entregará alimentos para estas familias, con duración estimada de un mes, además de realizar el acompañamiento y evaluación para determinar la distribución de la segunda y tercera ayuda humanitaria.  

El 12 de diciembre, la administración municipal entregó colchonetas y alimentos para tres días. A partir del 22 de diciembre la Gobernación de Nariño entregará alimentos con duración aproximada de ocho días adicionales y la UARIV atenderá con kit de hábitat y alimentos por un mes desde el 30 de diciembre de 2017. Desde el 13 de diciembre, el centro de salud municipal en articulación con Médicos sin Fronteras (MsF) realiza jornadas de atención en salud física y psicológica al total de la población desplazada. Se espera en el transcurso de la semana poder ingresar a zonas rurales para la atención en salud de las personas que se encuentran con restricciones.  

El 15 de diciembre, el Consejo Noruego para Refugiados (NRC) entregará subsidio de arrendamiento y alimentos con duración de ocho días a las 138 personas desplazadas, a través de la modalidad de cash .

2378194,"Los afectados por el sismo se enfrentan a un obstáculo más: el frío **En los campamentos de damnificados en la Ciudad de México las personas dependen de mantas y cobijas donadas para hacer frente a las bajas temperaturas**

Primero fue el sismo y tuvieron que dejar el departamento en el que vivían. Después, vino el miedo de que el edificio dañado fuera invadido. Armaron casas de campaña frente al inmueble para vigilar el único patrimonio que les quedaba: unos pocos muebles, ropas, electrodomésticos, televisores. Luego vino lo más difícil: cuando llovía el agua invadía las carpas y empapaba las colchonetas y cobijas. Nadie dormía en las noches de lluvia.

A pocos días de cumplirse tres meses del terremoto del 19 de septiembre, los afectados por el sismo en la Ciudad de México que perdieron sus casas y se instalaron en campamentos en las calles de la capital se enfrentan ahora a un nuevo obstáculo: la brusca caída de temperatura durante los últimos días, con mínimas cerca de los cero grados.

""El sábado y el lunes [9 y 11 de diciembre] fueron los peores días"", recuerda Lucina Chávez, de 75 años, vecina de un edificio afectado por el temblor entre las calles 5 de febrero y Guipúzcoa, en la delegación Benito Juárez. ""Las colchonetas están muy pegadas al suelo y no pude dormir porque me dieron calambres toda la noche"". La noche del miércoles 13 de diciembre esta anciana se abrigaba con una chamarra (chaqueta) y se frotaba las manos para calentarse. Son los mayores como ella y los niños del campamento los que sufren más con la oleada de frío en este campamento.

Chávez, que preparaba comida y la vendía en su barrio para obtener un ingreso extra para su familia, forma parte de un grupo que decidió instalarse en frente de la edificación de tres plantas que un día fue su casa. Es una construcción antigua —Chávez llevaba 47 años viviendo allí— y el reducido valor de la renta les permitía vivir con poco en una zona céntrica y bien comunicada con el resto de la ciudad. ""Por aquí no se encuentra un departamento por menos de 8.000 pesos"", afirma Antonio Monterde Chávez, de 52 años e hijo de Lucina Chávez. Se quedaron en las carpas porque la ayuda que recibieron no les permitía encontrar una nueva casa cerca de ahí y no querían abandonar la región donde crecieron y donde trabajan. ""El edificio es parte de nuestra vida"", cuenta Monterde.

La Secretaría de Desarrollo Social de la Ciudad de México entrega diariamente alimento a 11 campamentos en la capital mexicana. 

En la calle Cinco de febrero 962, duermen cada noche entre 15 y 20 personas en casas de campaña prestadas por vecinos y parientes. Vivían en el edificio afectado más de 40 personas, pero muchos pasaron a dormir en las casas de familiares y se acercan al campamento apenas durante el día. Con la llegada del invierno, los que pudieron buscaron asilo para sus niños con familiares.

Los que se quedan durante la noche se enfrentan a las bajas temperaturas con nada más que mantas y cobijas. Algunas lograron sacarlas de los departamentos, pero la mayoría las recibieron como donaciones. ""La solidaridad de la gente fue lo que más nos ayudó"", comenta Lucina Chávez.

Según datos del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, un nuevo frente frío ingresará este jueves por el norte del país, lo que mantendrá las bajas temperaturas en la Ciudad de México, donde se esperan mínimas de entre cero y cinco grados.

""Hay un momento en la noche que el frío te levanta"", confiesa María de Jesús Valdez, de 33 años, que desde hace 12 vivía en el edificio. La noche del miércoles le tocó a Valdez estar de guardia para vigilar que nadie entrase en la construcción. ""Nos quedamos caminando la madrugada de un lado a otro para vencer el frío"", comenta. Tiene tres hijos —el más joven nació pocos días antes del terremoto— y ante la llegada del invierno, los dejó en la casa de su suegra.

Nadie en el campamento esperaba seguir en la calle tres meses después del sismo. Sin tener adónde ir, fueron quedándose a la espera de una solución. La primera noche se hizo una semana, luego un mes. Lo que parecía provisional fue ganando aires de permanente y ya van casi 90 días. No tienen claro lo que va a pasar. Algunos dicen que la construcción se tiene que demoler, otros que les prometieron recuperarla. Lo único cierto es que nadie se arriesga a quedarse adentro por mucho tiempo en la estructura, que está inclinada y llena de grietas. El optimismo se desvanece conforme  bajan las temperaturas: ""Cada vez es un obstáculo diferente. Ahora lo difícil es el frío, luego volverá a llover"", dice María de Jesús Valdez.",269,"Spanish"
2378174,"El Director General de la OIM hace un urgente llamamiento en favor de la “Migración Segura en un Mundo en Constante Movimiento”, en vísperas del Día Internacional del Migrante Ginebra – El Embajador William Lacy Swing, Director General de la OIM, el Organismo de las Naciones Unidas para la Migración, hace un llamamiento urgente en favor de la “Migración Segura en un Mundo en Constante Movimiento” en vísperas del Día Internacional del Migrante a celebrarse el lunes 18 de diciembre de 2017. 

La Organización festejará el Día Internacional del Migrante (IMD por su sigla en inglés) a través de una variedad de eventos mundiales entre los cuales se incluye una ceremonia de entrega de premios en Ginebra en el marco del Festival de Cine sobre Migración Mundial. En el festival, que celebra su segunda edición, han participado muchos socios tanto del sector público como privado conjuntamente con misiones de la OIM en más de 100 países.

Además de la proyección de películas en Ginebra y Nueva York, la OIM estará presente en un debate sobre liderazgo en la ONU con la participación del Antonio Guterres, Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas,  el cual tendrá lugar en la Casa UNICEF en Manhattan y cuyo tema será el Pacto Mundial sobre Migración. Se prevé que tal Pacto sea adoptado a finales de 2018, una vez concluidas las negociaciones entre los Estados Miembros de Naciones Unidas.

El debate sobre liderazgo de la ONU pondrá el foco de atención en cuestiones comunes en relación al tema migratorio y dejará de lado todo aquello que genera divisiones, dijo el DG Swing. A pesar de la retórica existente en torno a la migración, que por lo común suele ser mordaz, la misma no debe considerarse como un problema a resolver sino como una realidad que debe ser gestionada, él explicó.

Entre los eventos de la Casa UNICEF también se encuentran la inauguración en Nueva York de UNPACKED: Refugee Baggage (El Equipaje de un Refugiado, desempacado), una instalación de arte que ha sido aclamada por la crítica (para mayores detalles sobre la misma por favor visitar www.Together-in-NY.org).

Esta poderosa exposición da vida a historias de refugiados que se han asentado en los Estados Unidos a través de la exploración de traumas pasados y por medio de modelos tridimensionales de sus hogares, montados sobre las maletas que ellos llevaban consigo cuando viajaban. En una exposición particularmente atrapante, los visitantes podrán explorar el hogar bombardeado de un refugiado a través de imágenes de realidad virtual.

La OIM también lanzará una serie de podcasts denominados JUNTOS: Historias Personales de Migrantes y de Refugiados, cuyo anfitrión será el refugiado iraquí-americano de 19 años de edad Ahmed Badr, quien siendo muy joven y junto a su familia, se reasentó en los EE.UU. con la ayuda de  la OIM. El podcast, conjuntamente con una nueva aplicación móvil, comparte historias humanas de migración verdaderamente emocionantes, por medio de entrevistas reveladoras a jóvenes migrantes y refugiados en los EE.UU.

Los primeros cuatro shows del podcast estarán disponibles en iTunes y en otras plataformas de vanguardia.

Ahmed, quien tenía 7 años de edad cuando una bomba se incrustó sobre la casa de su familia en Bagdad, habla en las dos primeras emisiones de la serie juntamente con sus padres y con su hermana Maryam, quienes hacen un relato extraordinario de la historia familiar.  En episodios subsiguientes, Ahmed entrevista a otros jóvenes refugiados y migrantes.

Los podcasts son parte de la iniciativa JUNTOS de la ONU destinada a fomentar la comprensión de las cuestiones vinculadas a migrantes y refugiados por medio del poder de las redes sociales.

En una columna no editorial, escrita en ocasión del Día Internacional del Migrante (por favor leer Nuestro derecho a ingresar debe ser a través de la migración regular y no mediante botes agujereados), el DG Swing sostuvo que: “Mientras vivimos en una época en la que una elite privilegiada considera la movilidad mundial como un derecho virtualmente innato, tal derecho le es negado a muchos otros que se encuentran atrapados en una pésima situación económica o de conflicto, sin solución alguna a la vista.”

El DG Swing advirtió que negar el problema solo llevará a que las “quienes se dedican a crear redes de tráfico de migrantes, de trata de personas o a la esclavitud moderna sigan haciendo sus negocios con total impunidad.”

El DG Swing estará en Nueva York a lo largo de su ajetreada agenda del día lunes y planea atender consultas de los medios periodísticos.

2378049,"Gobierno del presidente Morales cumple con entrega de viviendas a familias de El Cambray II Ciudad de Guatemala, 15 dic (AGN).- El gobierno del presidente Jimmy Morales, terminó hoy con la entrega de viviendas a las familias afectadas por el deslizamiento registrado el 1 de octubre de 2015 en El Cambray II, en el municipio de Santa Catarina Pinula, que dejó 280 personas fallecidas.

La entrega oficial de las llaves de otras 30 casas que se suman a 143 entregadas con anterioridad en la nueva lotificación llamada “Querida Familia”, ubicada en San José Pinula, estuvo a cargo del ministro de Comunicaciones, Infraestructura y Vivienda, Aldo García.

Durante su intervención, el funcionario resaltó que luego de una serie de vicisitudes y problemas que se tuvieron que enfrentar para poder entregar el proyecto habitacional, el presidente Morales cumplió con la palabra dada de concluir durante su mandato el proceso.

“Estamos hoy aquí para poder hacer la entrega simbólica de este proyecto tan importante, el señor presidente Morales está muy contento de que esto ocurra, nuestro Presidente está muy feliz de que esto se haya culminado de una manera correcta y sin mayores problemas”, dijo el funcionario.

Por su parte, César González, presidente de la Asociación Amigos del Cambray II, agradeció a nombre de los beneficiarios el interés del Gobierno central para concluir con el proyecto, que fue abandonado por las administraciones anteriores.

“Nosotros como vecinos estamos recibiendo la edificación de un sueño, es tiempo de agradecer a las personas e instituciones, ya que sin su apoyo este sueño no sería posible”, expresó González.

Recordó que el alud de El Cambray fue una tragedia que enlutó a todo un país y dejó mucha tristeza, pero también hizo que un pueblo entero hiciera a un lado sus diferencias sociales, religiosas y partidistas, y se volcara a ayudar a personas desconocidas que tenían una necesidad y que estaban pasando por un mal momento.

“No dejemos de luchar ni de soñar, porque la vida no tendría ningún valor ni sentido; si todo estuviera resuelto, los sueños y esperanzas no existirían”, manifestó el presidente de la Asociación.

El alud ocurrido en la colonia El Cambray II, en el municipio de  Santa Catarina Pinula, Guatemala, el 1 de octubre de 2015, destruyó más de dos centenares de residencias que quedaron soterradas, dejando un saldo de 280 fallecidos.",269,"Spanish"

Este importante suceso se ha llevado a cabo en el marco del proceso de Certificación de Reconocimiento a las dos primeras Áreas con Manejo Sostenible de Tierras en Cuba, la Unidad Básica de Producción Cooperativa “UBPC Eliomar Noa Moreira”, perteneciente a la Empresa Agroforestal de Imías, en Guantánamo y la “Finca Tierra Brava” perteneciente a la Cooperativa de Créditos y Servicios (CCS Niceto Pérez) del municipio Los Palacios en Pinar del Río.

En este Acuerdo Colaborativo, se han plasmado las principales ideas para el apoyo por parte del banco a la aplicación de una agricultura ambientalmente amigable, que sea capaz de producir alimentos sin romper el equilibrio de los ecosistemas y que a su vez propicie un beneficio económico importante para los productores acogidos a esta modalidad de producción.

Esta alianza constituye una experiencia novedosa, donde de manera concreta se logran sinergias entre Instituciones Nacionales, Programas Internacionales y Agencias de Colaboración Internacional como el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD), lo que facilitará a corto y mediano plazos, una garantía de financiamiento desde el banco a los procesos productivos agropecuarios, contribuyendo de este modo a la sostenibilidad alimentaria.

2377959,"Acción Urgente: Desplazamiento y evacuación de comunidades indígenas deja el enfrentamiento entre grupos armados ilegales y la explosión de artefacto en el norte del Cauca. Los abajo firmantes manifestamos al Estado Colombiano, a los medios de comunicación y a la opinión pública en general, la más profunda preocupación por las nuevas afectaciones a los Derechos Fundamentales del pueblo indígena Nasa en el norte del Cauca, por hechos ocurridos los días 08 y 09 de diciembre de 2017.  

**Antecedentes** 

El Tejido de Defensa de la Vida y los Derechos Humanos de la Asociación de Cabildos Indígenas del Norte del Cauca-ACIN, en diversos boletines emitidos durante el año 2017, advirtió sobre la presencia de más de 10 grupos armados ilegales diferentes en su territorio, luego de la firma del acuerdo de paz entre el Gobierno Nacional y las FARC.  

Durante la reciente Minga Indígena el Consejo Regional Indígena del Cauca-CRIC y la ACIN, denunciaron la gravedad de esta situación y los riesgos que de ella se podían derivar.  
No obstante, a la fecha el Estado colombiano no ha iniciado las acciones pertinentes para garantizar el control y desmantelamiento de estos grupos armados en la zona.  

**Hechos** 

El 8 de diciembre, en Cerro Tijeras, se presentaron enfrentamientos entre dos grupos armados ilegales presuntamente identificados como EPL y una disidencia de las FARC, en hechos que todavía están siendo investigados por la ACIN y sus Kiwe Thegnas (Guardias Indígenas).  

En medio del enfrentamiento, por lo menos, seis personas ajenas a la comunidad resultaron muertas. Los Kiwe Thegnas recorren el territorio para determinar la cifra total de víctimas muertas, heridas y afectadas.  

Desde el mismo día se desplazaron de su territorio 253 familias hacía tres sitios de asamblea permanente. De la Vereda de Aguablanca se desplazaron 48 familias, de Robles 82, de La Cabaña 60 y de Olivares 63.  

De acuerdo con la ACIN, instituciones estatales informan que la zona está militarizada y se esperan nuevos combates ya que los grupos armados todavía transitan por la zona.  

**Peticiones** 

El 9 de diciembre, a las 8:00 p.m. detonó un artefacto explosivo en la Buitrera, Resguardo de Huellas, municipio de Caloto, afectando dos miembros del Ejército Nacional, según información aún no confirmada.  

**Al Estado colombiano** 

Iniciar, en coordinación con las autoridades indígenas, el desmantelamiento de los grupos armados ilegales existentes, y de aquellos que surjan en el marco de la implementación de los acuerdos de paz, cuya presencia y accionar vulneran los derechos del pueblo Nasa.  

Dar seguimiento a la evolución de los hechos en la Mesa de Concertación creada en el marco de los acuerdos suscritos entre el CRIC y el Gobierno nacional, durante la pasada Minga Indígena de 2017.  

Convocar la instancia de Alto Nivel del Capítulo Étnico para analizar la situación y definir medidas estratégicas y de prevención.  

Garantizar un mecanismo de atención de emergencias que opere de manera extraordinaria durante el periodo de fiestas de fin de año en 2017.  

Iniciar, de manera inmediata, las investigaciones sobre las Infracciones al DIH y las violaciones de Derechos Humanos ocurridas sobre la población indígena.  

**A la Comunidad Internacional** 

Apoyar las acciones de protección que definan las autoridades indígenas, así como las labores que desarrollan actualmente los Kiwe Thegnas y el Tejido de Defensa de la Vida y los Derechos Humanos.

El pasado 8 de diciembre se llevó a cabo, en la sede de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores de México, la Reunión Plenaria Ordinaria del Comité Técnico del Fondo Mixto de Cooperación Técnica y Científica México-España. 

El Embajador de España, Luis Fernández-Cid y el Director Ejecutivo de la AMEXCID, Agustín García-López, que presidieron la reunión, coincidieron en la importancia estratégica de la cooperación España-México, al haberse convertido en una plataforma privilegiada destinada a la conformación de Alianzas para apoyar complementariamente el logro de los Objetivos definidos por la Agenda 2030. También señalaron que los 33 proyectos cofinanciados durante el período 2014-2017, con un presupuesto que supera los 8 millones de e​uros, son una clara prueba de la fortaleza del Fondo Mixto como instrumento de gestión. 

Los proyectos realizados durante el período señalado se han concentrado en los Estados de Oaxaca, Chiapas, Michoacán y en la Ciudad de México. Mediante la modalidad de Cooperación Triangular se han puesto en marcha 12 iniciativas en Guatemala, Honduras, Haití, República Dominicana, El Salvador y Panamá. Los 12 proyectos gestionados bajo la modalidad de Alianzas Público Privadas para el Desarrollo- APPD han permitido la incorporación de la iniciativa privada empresarial, contando con empresas como Gas Natural Fenosa y Acciona. 

Durante la reunión se acordó que, durante el primer semestre de 2018, España asumirá la presidencia rotatoria del Fondo Mixto. En el Plan de Trabajo que se presentará el próximo enero se pondrá especial énfasis en la cofinanciación de proyectos dirigidos a la rehabilitación post-terremotos, programas para hacer frente a los retos derivados del fenómeno de las migraciones de menores no acompañados del Triángulo Norte, así como el apoyo al CARICOM para mejorar la gestión de riesgos por fenómenos naturales extremos mediante acciones de Cooperación Triangular.  De igual manera, en paralelo se impulsarán iniciativas en los ámbitos de derechos humanos, seguridad nacional, gobernanza democrática y apoyo a comunidades vulnerables urbanas, rurales e indígenas y en el sector del agua, entre otros ámbitos, sin descuidar el apoyo a la equidad de género.

​Asimismo, se convino en avanzar en la definición del Marco Estratégico de Cooperación Técnica y Científica México-España para la cooperación a futuro, etapa en la que, México impulsará su papel de líder regional. 

Finalmente se recordó a las víctimas y damnificados por los terremotos de septiembre, al tiempo que se agradeció la extraordinaria respuesta brindada por España a través de la Unidad Militar de Emergencia UME, el proyecto de apoyo psicosocial acordado entre la AECID y Save the Children y las numerosas empresas que brindaron su ayuda solidaria. 

La Reunión contó, además, con la presencia de las diferentes Direcciones de la AMEXCID, el equipo de la OTC, representantes de 26 instituciones mexicanas y empresas españolas que llevan a cabo acciones de cooperación para el desarrollo cofinanciadas por el Fondo Mixto, lo cual refleja el gran reconocimiento a la Cooperación Española, que genera tan amplia respuesta.",269,"Spanish"

En la actividad participaron directores y representantes de las direcciones de comunicación de las instituciones de gobierno, cooperación internacional y sociedad civil, para intercambiar experiencias y compartir materiales de comunicación que apoyen la prevención de la desnutrición crónica en Guatemala.

Óscar Flores, director de Comunicación de SESAN, agradeció  la participación de los comunicadores que asistieron a los tres talleres realizados durante 2017,  así como el apoyo de la Organización Panamericana de la Salud y Organización Mundial de la salud  OPS/OMS, Programa Mundial de Alimentos –PMA- y  la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura -FAO-, para llevar a cabo la iniciativa.

“Hay que diferenciar según el contexto de género, incluyendo la pertinencia cultural, paternidad responsable y el enfoque generacional, para que la comunicación sea oportuna y eficaz”, opinó Amalia Ayala, Asesora en Salud y Ciclo de Vida de OPS/OMS, al referirse a la importancia de elaborar un diagnóstico y un plan de comunicación en seguridad alimentaria y nutricional.

José Valls, Oficial Nacional del Mecanismo de Asistencia de FAO y Unión Europea, para las políticas First, en representación de Diego Recalde, representante de FAO para Guatemala, destacó la importancia de elaborar un plan de comunicación en seguridad alimentaria y nutricional, que permita no solo sensibilizar sobre el tema, sino identificar los mensajes y materiales de comunicación adecuados.

En esta ocasión se realizaron talleres prácticos con los comunicadores, con grupos de trabajo por pilar, para identificar los mensajes y materiales de comunicación adecuados para llegar a una audiencia meta, que permitan sensibilizar sobre los cuatro pilares de SAN: aprovechamiento biológico, consumo de alimentos, disponibilidad de alimentos y acceso a los alimentos, con el objetivo de generar propuestas de acciones para comunicar los mensajes.

Entre los proyectos que se propusieron están la realización de obras de teatro en escuelas y la realización de un manual de comunicación en SAN para periodistas, que sea validado intersectorialmente, entre otros.

Según Lynda Guzmán, subdirectora de Comunicación de SESAN, el objetivo de esta red de comunicadores es unir los esfuerzos para que las instituciones realizan para comunicar temas de seguridad alimentaria y nutricional hacia la población de manera efectiva, lograr cambios de comportamiento y reducir así los índices de desnutrición en el país, por lo que se espera continuar con el trabajo e iniciar con la  ejecución de acciones en 2018.",269,"Spanish"

**CIUDAD DE PANAMÁ, Panamá 13 de diciembre de 2017 –** El 12 y 13 de diciembre del 2017 fue aprobada la Estrategia Regional para la Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres (GRD) en el Sector Agrícola y la Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional (SAN) en América Latina y el Caribe (ALC), en el marco de la IV Reunión Ministerial de Agricultura Familiar y Desarrollo Rural de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños - CELAC- realizada en San Salvador, El Salvador.

La Estrategia Regional se gestó bajo el liderazgo de la CELAC, que identificó la necesidad de generar un instrumento común para la colaboración y coordinación de sus países miembros en materia de GRD y Adaptación al Cambio Climático (ACC) en el sector agrícola.

Con el objetivo de ""prevenir la aparición de nuevos riesgos de desastres y reducir los existentes en el sector agrícola y la SAN implementando medidas integradas e inclusivas"" la Estrategia Regional propiciará el trabajo colaborativo, coordinado y coherente entre países y; priorizará las medidas de valor agregado regional, subregional, multi-país y transfronterizo que complementen las acciones nacionales para la implementación del Marco de Sendai para la Reducción del Riesgo de Desastres 2015-2030 en el sector agrícola y la SAN.

La Estrategia Regional y su proceso de desarrollo fue presentado por Camilo Navarro, Director Ejecutivo de Agroseguros y Coordinador Nacional de Gestión Integral del Riesgo, del Ministerio de Agricultura de Chile y Secretario del Comité Técnico ad hoc constituido para este fin. A su vez se contó con las intervenciones de Liliana Miranda, Directora General de Planificación, Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganadería del Paraguay; Aileen Nestor, Subdirectora de Planificación y Políticas, del Ministerio de Agricultura de Guyana; y Edwin Rojas, Coordinador de la Unidad de Cambio Climático, Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganadería y Alimentación de Guatemala.

La aprobación de la Estrategia culmina un proceso iniciado en abril de 2016 el cual contó con la asistencia técnica de la Organización de la Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura (FAO) y de la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas para la Reducción del Riesgo de Desastres (UNISDR), y que combinó rondas de consultas técnicas y políticas con representantes de Ministerios de Agricultura y de las Autoridades de GRD y/o protección civil, entre otros.

La delegación del Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganadería y Alimentación de Guatemala ofreció albergar la próxima reunión del Comité Técnico ad hoc de la Estrategia Regional, con el fin de desarrollar los mecanismos operativos hacia la implementación de dicho instrumento.

Entre el 2015 y el 2016, por primera vez en los últimos 15 años el número de personas subalimentadas en ALC aumentó de 2,4 millones, alcanzado un total de 43,5 millones de personas. Esto demuestra la gran fragilidad en los avances contra la pobreza y el hambre, en los cuales la incidencia de desastres constituye uno de los principales factores de erosión.

Así mismo, la FAO y la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL) estiman que la actividad agrícola en la región es el área económica más afectada por el cambio climático. Se estima que entre el 2006 y el 2016, 23% de los daños y pérdidas causados por los desastres de mediana y alta intensidad en países en desarrollo afectaron al sector agrícola, y que 80% de daños y pérdidas ligados a eventos de sequía se concentran en dicho sector. En ALC estas pérdidas estuvieron vinculadas principalmente a inundaciones (55%), sequías (27%) y tormentas (10%), y generaron una pérdida del 2,7% del crecimiento esperado del sector y un incremento del 25% en las importaciones de alimentos (datos FAO).",269,"Spanish"
2377849,"Los niños y niñas de Bolivar, Cauca ahora cuentan con agua potable y una tubería nueva en su institución educativa **Viernes 15 Diciembre 2017**
Alexander Girón, coordinador de la institución educativa, nos cuenta sobre lo que nuestro proyecto ha logrado en el colegio en términos de salud y educación.

“En el primer aspecto, la ayuda de Save the Children se ha dirigido al fortalecimiento de las pruebas externas a través de formación a los estudiantes con talleres y simulacros con ellos.

Nos parece que en ese sentido ha habido avances, porque los muchachos ya tienen mayor conocimiento de qué es una prueba, cómo se estructura un formulario y tienen mayor experiencia con estas pruebas de simulación.

Aunque la institución siempre ha tenido un nivel superior y gracias a esto los hemos mantenido, la organización ha tenido un papel muy importante en el fortalecimiento a los estudiantes” Además, el proyecto tiene un componente de capacitaciones e infraestructura en instituciones que no tienen abastecimiento de agua y que tienen problemáticas de enfermedades en los y las estudiantes.

“En el municipio hemos tenido un problema de abastecimiento de agua que ha sido muy complicado. Es en todo el pueblo y no tenemos para abastecer a toda la comunidad, en temporada de verano hemos sufrido mucho. Ahora con la intervención de Save the Children esperamos a que las cosas cambien”. Explica qué ha cambiado en la institución educativa con nuestra llegada.

“Los tanques son mucho más amplios de los que teníamos, están ubicados estratégicamente y se cambiaron las baterías sanitarias por baterías sanitarias ahorradoras. Antes teníamos, más el problema de agua, baterías con unos tanques grandísimos, por eso se desperdiciaba el poco de agua que podíamos recolectar en invierno.

En la institución tenemos unos problemas legales con respecto las escrituras públicas y por eso no podemos acceder a los recursos de la Ley 21 y no tenemos recursos, inversiones y ayudas para la institución son de mínima cuantía.

Miramos con muy buenos ojos la ayuda que nos ha ofrecido la organización”.

De esta manera, aunque admite que se ha hecho bastante por los estudiantes, los retos que quedan son bastantes y tienen que ver con la conciencia en los beneficiarios.

“Muchas veces la gente no entiende que, en un proyecto de infraestructura, es fundamental la parte educativa; nosotros estamos conscientes de que tenemos un problema con el agua y no tenemos la conciencia de ahorro.

El papel de los docentes y directivos es intentar sensibilizar al estudiante para que el agua que nos llega tenga muchos más beneficios con el tratamiento que nosotros le demos. Tenemos que aprender a racionarla con otras campañas sobre salud y parásitos nos puede ayudar porque a los muchachos toca repetirles, lo que se les repite se les queda. Si bien es cierto que hay unas adecuaciones, eso no es el 100% de la ayuda, gran parte de la solución es nuestra formación”.",269,"Spanish"

“Mi nombre es Alba Lucia Pinilla, aquí vivo con mi esposo y mi niño pequeño, tengo dos hijos ya grandes uno de 15 y uno de 17, ellos estudian aquí. Este asentamiento es una invasión, los terrenos son de la Gobernación, pero estas invasiones se dan por la falta de vivienda porque el gobierno no prioriza a personas que realmente necesitan, a personas que son víctimas, a desplazados, madres cabezas de hogar, a personas muy vulnerables, aquí hay personas en extrema pobreza. Yo calculo que hay son unas 1000 familias, con la llegada de las familias de venezolanos y colombianos retornados.

Aquí lo más necesario son los servicios, no hay agua potable, no hay vías, la luz pues aquí pasa una red que por lo general vemos cómo adecuamos. Pero aquí lo más importante es el agua potable y las vías porque están muy malas y la vivienda porque aquí tenemos es vivienda, pero no es digna, es un cambuchito donde las personas les toca vivir por obligación”.

*En este asentamiento los niños y niñas van a escuelas y colegios cercanos, sin embargo, hay un número considerable de niños y niñas desescolarizados, puesto que llegaron a la zona durante el año y no pudieron legalizar sus documentos a tiempo para ingresar al colegio.*

“Todos los niños que vienen de Venezuela no están estudiando, ellos durante el día están en las casas cuidando a los hermanitos por ahí mientras los papás van a trabajar, así como se ven por ahí andando porque realmente aquí no tienen ellos como una recreación, no tienen nada. La mayoría de personas que vivimos aquí somos gente humilde, el oficio muchas personas trabajan, madres cabezas de hogar trabajan en casas de familia, vendiendo tintos, aquí como yo le decía operarios de aseo, gente que no tiene mayor escolaridad para vivir aquí, para que aquí viva un profesional.

La mayoría son obreros que trabajan en casas de familias, en oficios así ambulantes. La iniciativa de Save the Children para los niños y niñas me ha parecido muy bonita, y quiero agradecerles porque realmente aquí eso llama a gritos, aquí no hay nada que entretenga a esos muchachos, para que no mantengan en la calle porque, ahí es donde salen muchachos para la delincuencia y se van perdiendo poco a poco y no se dan cuenta, entonces con estos talleres vienen y se relajan, mantienen una energía buena, entonces eso va mejorando el ambiente y aquí mantener la armonía y la paz entre nosotros mismos”.",269,"Spanish"

Los efectos traumáticos que dejaron las intensas lluvias y los desbordes del río en la zona norte del Perú, en la mente y el corazón de los niños y niñas fueron muy amplios y profundos. Ellos y sus familias se quedaron, en muchas situaciones, sin sus casas o sus pertenencias. También dejaron de ir a clases, debido a las inundaciones.

Hoy este Proyecto educativo cierra una etapa, con resultados exitosos y con un Festival educativo-artístico que involucró a niños de la primera infancia y a toda la comunidad educativa de esta zona. Este festival de cierre de Proyecto, desarrollado exclusivamente para los más pequeños, tuvo de escenario el polideportivo del centro poblado de Parachique-La Bocana.

Fueron más de 500 niños y niñas que participaron de los diversos talleres como teatro de títeres, pintado de murales, canto con cajón y guitarra, artesanía marina y danzas típicas. Ellos fueron acompañados en todo momento por sus profesoras de aula y estuvieron guiados por los promotores culturales del Proyecto.

“Es importante el impacto que tienen las artes y la cultura en el restablecimiento del tejido social después de situaciones de estrés, de conflicto, o de desastres naturales, como los que hemos vivido. Este es un Proyecto con muchas posibilidades de replicarse a nivel nacional e internacional, y que ha permitido una increíble conjunción de fuerzas público privadas a favor de la atención socioemocional de más de 500 niños”, mencionó Enrique López Hurtado, Coordinador de Cultura de UNESCO Perú, en el Festival de clausura del Proyecto.

Como se dio a conocer, el desarrollo de esta Estrategia llevó a que se capacitaran a 68 directoras, 43 profesoras y 35 artistas y artesanos de Sechura y Piura, que se convirtieron en los promotores culturales líderes que llevaron sesiones llenas de arte y cultura a las escuelas, fomentando en todos los niños y niñas su expresión artística y emocional más espontánea.

“Primero teníamos que entender las necesidades de los niños, ya que fueron ellos los más afectados por este desastre natural. Nos propusimos trabajar y crear un plan en conjunto con las profesoras. Hicimos música, dibujos, juegos. Era necesario levantar la autoestima de ellos y lo logramos; en cada sesión nos esperaban muy alegres”, expresó Hugo Antón, artista plástico de Parachique-La Bocana, durante el evento de cierre del Proyecto al que asistieron autoridades locales y nacionales.

Asimismo, la profesora del nivel inicial, Elaide Tejada Briceño en su intervención en la ceremonia de Clausura manifestó que uno de los logros del Proyecto fue romper las cadenas que tenían muchos niños, debido a su temor de expresarse libremente con el arte. “Teníamos niños tímidos que no querían participar, pero en base a este trabajo y metodología empieza a nacer por ellos mismos el gusto y el interés de expresarse libremente”, expresó la docente.

**TRABAJO EN CONJUNTO**

A su vez, la directora de la UGEL Sechura, Socorro Cornejo Zapata, destacó que el Proyecto “Arte para todos” desde un inicio haya contado con el involucramiento de varias instituciones nacionales y locales comprometidas con el bienestar educativo y cultural de los niños, tal como la misma UGEL Sechura, la Municipalidad Provincial de Sechura, Municipalidad Delegada de Parachique-La Bocana y la Dirección Desconcentrada de Cultura de Piura.",269,"Spanish"

El Ministerio de Salud (Minsa) aprobó el documento técnico: “Plan de Contingencia frente a los efectos de las lluvias 2017 - 2018"" con la finalidad de fortalecer la organización para el desarrollo de acciones de preparación y respuesta de los servicios de salud frente a los efectos de las precipitaciones que ocurran en el país.

Según la Resolución Ministerial N° 1114-2017/MINSA, publicada hoy en el Diario Oficial El Peruano, el mencionado documento responde al estudio de Escenario de Riesgo en Salud frente a los efectos de las lluvias 2017-2018, realizado con el apoyo del Centro de Estimación, Prevención y Reducción del Riesgo de Desastres (Cenepred).

 En el marco del Día Internacional de los Derechos Humanos que se celebra este 10 de diciembre, el Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos, Roberto Herrera Cáceres, pidió hoy respeto por la vida y la integridad física, tanto de las personas que participan en las manifestaciones como de los agentes que integran los cuerpos de seguridad  del Estado.

Hasta ahora, más de una docena de hondureños,  entre manifestantes y policías, han muerto en circunstancias aún no esclarecidas por las autoridades encargadas de la investigación en el país.

De acuerdo a datos recabados por el ente estatal de derechos humanos, alrededor de 14 personas  han muerto, entre ellos dos  miembros de la Policía Nacional.

De acuerdo al recuento de los hechos seis murieron en San Pedro Sula, dos en Olancho, 3 en Tegucigalpa, dos en La Ceiba y uno en el departamento de Yoro.

El Defensor del Pueblo considera que es repudiable y condenable todo acto en el que se le prive de la vida a una persona.

Tenemos nosotros reflejado  que ha habido aproximadamente 14 muertes de compatriotas, lo cual que es sumamente repudiable, expresó.

Agregó que esas actitudes violentas  son intolerables, “no se puede privar  de la vida a ninguna persona”.

Indicó que es un deber fundamental de todo habitante, en el territorio nacional,  velar por el respeto  de la vida, la integridad de las personas  y por el ejercicio pacífico de todos sus derechos humanos.

El ombudsman hondureño lamentó que se esté deteriorando el respeto a la dignidad del ser humano y que “entre hermanos nos estemos desangrando”.

Destacó la importancia de evitar la violencia entre hermanos y actuar solidariamente en paz con respeto al pluralismo de ideas.

“Hemos hecho una manifestación categórica y hemos llamado también y estamos dando seguimiento a las investigaciones  que se puedan hacer,  tanto por la policía como por el propio Ministerio Público”, declaró.

Herrera Cáceres recomendó, en las últimas horas, que todo funcionario o autoridad  encargada de aplicar el Decreto Ejecutivo que restringe la libre circulación, deberá respetar los derechos humanos de cada persona y de toda la población,  así mismo, destacó el respeto que debe haber por parte de la población hacia las autoridades.

En ese sentido, pidió al Ejecutivo incluir en las excepciones del decreto, a representantes de la Secretaría de Estado de Derechos Humanos, y a los defensores de derechos humanos para que realicen su labor sin restricciones de ninguna naturaleza.

Espera que cese el toque de queda en todo el territorio nacional

En torno a la suspensión del toque de queda, en varios departamentos del país, el titular del CONADEH, dijo que desde su aplicación le ha dado seguimiento al Decreto que restringe la libre circulación y que, por eso, le recomendó al Poder Ejecutivo que no  se debe aplicar restricción a derechos  en lugares o departamentos  donde no hay ninguna necesidad.

En ese sentido, nuestro deseo  es que pronto cese el toque de queda  en todo el territorio nacional y que la población vuelva a sus actividades normales, precisó.

Es lo que esperamos, entendemos  los fundamentos que motivaron la restricción de la libre circulación, pero si esos fundamentos están desapareciendo  es bueno restablecer un poco la  normalidad  y hacer cesar ese decreto, puntualizó.

Consultado en torno  a la ampliación del periodo de vigencia  del decreto que prohíbe la portación de armas de fuego,  respondió, que  el CONADEH siempre  ha tenido una posición en contra del uso de armas.

Nuestra aspiración seria llegar a un momento  en que el único portador de armas sea la autoridad legítimamente autorizada para ello, sin embargo, dijo que  hay circunstancias, como las actuales, donde  ya existe una cultura en ese sentido.

Hizo énfasis en que frente a cualquier  disposición que tome el Poder Ejecutivo  en relación con la portación de armas  o la restricción de las mismas, el uso de armas se haga siempre con la serenidad y responsabilidad que requiere  un instrumento que priva y tiene muchas  amenazas sobre la vida de las demás personas.",269,"Spanish"

Durante varios meses, los beneficiarios de este programa aceptaron el reto de regresar a las aulas, se esforzaron por realizar sus tareas y proyectos educativos, para alcanzar un logro en su formación, lo que los llevará a tener nuevas y mejores oportunidades en el mundo laboral.

La Academia Nacional de Aprendizaje (Andap) tuvo a cargo la capacitación. De cara al 2018 presentará una oferta de programas en mercadeo, sistemas, gastronomía, auxiliar de preescolar, gestión contable y financiera, diseño de modas, entre otros.   

“De repente un día estábamos en nuestras casas o trabajando y recibimos una llamada para capacitarnos de manera gratuita. Aceptamos con temores, con inseguridad, con dificultades para llegar al salón de clases. Empezó el proceso y hoy alcanzamos este logro”, expresó Yeison Andrés Bedoya, un beneficiario.

“Estamos muy orgullosos de ello, preparados para afrontar un nuevo mundo, un mundo que nos queremos comer a pedacitos. Ya no somos víctimas, los invito a caminar con la frente en alto y a seguir demostrándole al país para qué estamos”, añadió. 

‘Educándonos para la Paz’ es un programa de formación en competencias laborales liderado por el Ministerio del Trabajo, con la cooperación de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo (OIT) y la Organización de Estados Iberoamericanos para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura (OEI).

Este programa beneficia a los sobrevivientes del conflicto gracias a un convenio que existe con la Unidad para las Víctimas, que busca la implementación, estructuración y ejecución de programas integrales que permitan la vinculación formal para la población víctima del conflicto armado. 

Con una inversión de $26.000 millones, en este programa participan 3.200 víctimas de 16 ciudades del país: Armenia, Barrancabermeja, Bucaramanga, Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Pereira, Villavicencio, Cartagena, Montería, Pasto, Barranquilla, Bogotá, Santa Marta y Cúcuta.

BOGOTÁ, D.C.

La Unidad para las Víctimas, en articulación con la Alta Consejería para los derechos de las Víctimas la Paz y la Reconciliación y el Ministerio de Defensa, lideró este jueves en Bogotá el primer encuentro interinstitucional con víctimas integrantes de la Fuerza Pública, con el objetivo de facilitar el acceso de estos sobrevivientes del conflicto armado a los beneficios que les ofrece el Estado.

Al evento asistieron 90 víctimas, activas y retiradas, de diferentes hechos victimizantes como desaparición forzada, desplazamiento, homicidio, secuestro, delitos contra la integridad sexual, abandono o despojo forzado de tierras, acto terrorista, perdida de bienes y tortura.
En el marco del encuentro, Ana María Almario, directora de Gestión Interinstitucional de la Unidad para las Víctimas, resaltó la importancia de continuar trabajando articuladamente con el Ministerio de Defensa, el Ejército de Colombia, la Policía Nacional y en general con todas las Fuerzas Armadas para garantizar el acceso efectivo y claro a los derechos que tienen las víctimas que hacen parte de la Fuerza Pública.

“Esta jornada es un avance del trabajo que se viene haciendo con diferentes entidades, teníamos un corto circuito en la política pública y lo que estamos haciendo es poder generar acciones de sinergia que garanticen los derechos de las víctimas que hacen parte de la Fuerza Pública” aseguró la directora de Gestión Interinstitucional de la Unidad para las Víctimas.

Así mismo, explicó que se está trabajando en un decreto que será expedido próximamente, el cual establece que es el Ministerio de Defensa el responsable de la ruta de reparación a los miembros víctimas de la Fuerza Pública y que, adicionalmente, dicta las funciones que la Unidad para las Víctimas debe atender con esta población afectada por el conflicto armado; con lo que se “acaba un peloteo entre las entidades y se permite destrabar un cuello de botella que teníamos”.

Durante el Encuentro se realizó un acto solemne en el que representantes de las diferentes entidades entregaron la Flor “no me olvides” a diez víctimas, como símbolo de reconocimiento por lo sucedido y, adicionalmente, se llevó a cabo una Feria de Servicios con la finalidad de dar a conocer la oferta de servicios de todas las instituciones para esta población.

La Unidad viene trabajando en la rehabilitación sicosocial de estas víctimas, al igual que en medidas de satisfacción, garantías de no repetición y en los procesos de memoria histórica, fundamentales para que las víctimas puedan superar el dolor que les generaron los hechos victimizantes y puedan continuar con el proceso de reparación integral al que tienen derecho.",269,"Spanish"

El segundo semestre académico de este año en la Universidad de Pamplona, Norte de Santander, terminó con 521 alumnos víctimas del conflicto armado estudiando una de las carreras ofertadas en este centro de enseñanza superior, según informó la funcionaria de la oficina administrativa y financiera de la institución, Adriana Barajas, a las profesionales de Oferta de la Unidad para las Víctimas territorial Norte de Santander y Arauca, Carmen Teresa Gómez y Eucaris Rada.

El número corresponde casi al cinco por ciento del total de alumnos de la universidad, la más antigua del Departamento, que recibe estudiantes de la región Caribe colombiana, especialmente de la Guajira, César, Sucre y Córdoba, además de los que llegan de los municipios nortesantandereanos.

“Para el primer semestre de 2017 estaban matriculados 451, pero ya en el segundo se contabilizaron 70 nuevos, y en el último reporte de matrículas para el primer semestre de 2018, hay 190 nuevos, lo que daría un total de 771 alumnos” sobrevivientes del conflicto armado, según explicó la funcionaria.

Esta población, explicó la funcionaria, se beneficia de un descuento del 25 por ciento en el valor de la matrícula de la carrera escogida, descuento que pueden mantener durante toda la carrera, mientras alcancen el promedio mínimo de 3,5 y no se cambien de programa.

Otro beneficio para esta población es la inclusión en el comedor universitario, donde pueden pagar $190.000 por todos los almuerzos del semestre, añadió Barajas.

En la reunión clave de dos días en Ginebra sobre el nuevo [Pacto Mundial sobre Refugiados,](http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/refugees-compact) Filippo Grandi recalcó que en todo el mundo las personas continúan huyendo de sus hogares, víctimas de una falla colectiva de la comunidad internacional para prevenir y resolver conflictos.

 “Nuestra misión es ahora más urgente que nunca…El éxodo de Myanmar a Bangladesh es el más visible, sin embargo, civiles inocentes continúan huyendo para salvar sus vidas en República Centroafricana, República del Congo, Irak, Sudán del Sur, Siria y otros lugares”, dijo Grandi.

“La atención mundial sobre los refugiados puede aumentar y disminuir en medio de los caprichos de la política internacional, pero la [Declaración de Nueva York](http://www.unhcr.org/new-york-declaration-for-refugees-and-migrants.html) continúa siendo un compromiso político de alto nivel para cambiar la forma en la que le damos respuesta a las crisis de refugiados”, afirmó a los delegados de la reunión en el Palacio de las Naciones.

La reunión, que se realizó del 12 al 13 de diciembre hizo balance de los resultados de las consultas que se han llevado a cabo desde que 193 Estados Miembro de las Naciones Unidas adoptaron, en 2016, la Declaración de Nueva York, en compromiso con la responsabilidad de los miembros de compartir las responsabilidades con los refugiados del mundo, así como para apoyar a las comunidades de acogida.

Esto incluye el Marco de Respuesta Integral para los Refugiados (CRRF, por sus siglas en inglés).

“Los refugiados pagan el precio (de esto), al igual que el grupo de países que cargan la parte más pesada de recibir refugiados sin el apoyo confiable de otros países que cuentan con más medios”, dijo, el titular de la agencia de la ONU para los refugiados.

“En un momento en que el multilateralismo flaquea en otras esferas, el Pacto Mundial sobre Refugiados es nuestra oportunidad de trazar un rumbo diferente a través del compromiso práctico y la cooperación basados en los valores humanitarios”, agregó.

El Pacto Mundial sobre Refugiados se basará en el marco internacional existente para la protección de las personas refugiadas, incluida la [Convención de 1951 sobre el Estatuto de los Refugiados](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/1951-refugee-convention.html) y pretende compartir de manera más equitativa la responsabilidad de acoger a las personas refugiadas del mundo, así como ayudarles a reconstruir sus vidas.

Este propondrá los pasos concretos que deben tomar los gobiernos, así como otras partes involucradas, para garantizar que las comunidades que acogen a los refugiados reciban el apoyo oportuno que necesitan, que los refugiados estén mejor incluidos en las comunidades de acogida (con acceso a la salud, la educación y los medios de vida), y que se busquen soluciones al sufrimiento de las personas desde el comienzo de una situación de refugiados.

En febrero de 2018, ACNUR comenzará las [consultas formales sobre el Pacto](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/1951-refugee-convention.html) con los gobiernos y otras partes interesadas. El Alto Comisionado propondrá un Pacto a la Asamblea General de la ONU hacia finales de 2018.",269,"Spanish"

“Todo este sistema de monitoreo marino-costera va a permitir tomar mediciones para hacer investigaciones e inclusive mediciones que permitirán en tiempo real emitir alertas de tsunami, alertas de condiciones de temperatura, de salinidad y condiciones de viento que se estén registrando a nivel de la fachada caribeña”, explicó el titular de la cartera de Ecosocialismo y Agua, Ramón Velásquez Araguayán.

Este procedimiento de monitoreo se pondrá en marcha el primer trimestre del año 2018, y se llevó a cabo con una inversión conjunta entre el Gobierno Bolivariano y la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU).

“La inversión por parte del programa de las Naciones Unidas, a través del Fondo Mundial del Clima, supera los siete millones 500 mil dólares y la contrapartida del Estado Venezolano son 16 millones de dólares y el aporte de la Política Nacional de Uso del Borde Costero (Pnubc), fueron de 7,5 millones de dólares”, expuso el Ministro.

Sseguró que para enero del 2018 se realizará una consulta pública en las regiones donde se está fortaleciendo el monitoreo que involucra los estados Vargas, Sucre, Nueva Esparta y Falcón.

2376344,"Boletín Informativo No. 4569 - Volcán de fuego incrementa nuevamente su actividad Considerable incremento en la actividad del volcán de Fuego se ha registrado durante las últimas horas, registrando constantes explosiones de tipo vulcanianas cargadas de ceniza que también está generando una columna de hasta 5 mil metros de altura sobre el nivel del mar la cual se desplaza hasta más de 15 kilómetros con dirección hacia el NorOeste, esto fue lo que anunció la mañana del jueves 14 de diciembre el Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulcanología, Meteorología e Hidrología -INSIVUMEH-.

Estas condiciones que se producen en este edifico volcánico también están ocasionando avalanchas de material volcánico desde el contorno del cráter que se encausan por las barrancas y la caída de ceniza se está registrando en comunidades cercanas y otras más alejadas como San Miguel Dueñas, Alotenango, Ciudad Vieja y no descartándose que se registre caída en Antigua Guatemala.

La Secretaría Ejecutiva de la Coordinadora Nacional para la Reducción de Desastres –SE CONRED- a través de su Unidad de Prevención de Volcanes –UPV-, mantiene monitoreos en zonas cercanas, ya que retumbos y vibraciones se escuchan en techos y ventanas de viviendas cercanas, por ahora nuestro ente científico también ha indicado mantener especial atención a la movilización de las partículas de ceniza, ya que debido a las condiciones del viento, estas podrían ser transportadas a mayor distancia.

Estas condiciones que actualmente presenta el volcán de Fuego hacen necesario recomendar a los pobladores que habitan cerca de este coloso, tomar todas las medidas de seguridad necesarias, al turismo es importante recordar que no es recomendado permanecer o acampar cerca debido a que estas explosiones podrían generar material balístico y ser expulsado a grandes distancias.",269,"Spanish"

2376214,"Crisis Hogar Seguro : Crisis de la niñez institucionalizada y del sistema de protección
de la infancia en Guatemala **SÍNTESIS**

La crisis del Hogar Seguro evidencia la debilidad del Estado de Guatemala en la protección especial de la niñez y adolescencia víctima de abuso, violencia, abandono y negligencia, así como la falta de mecanismos de fortalecimiento y preservación familiar que prevengan la separación de la niñez y adolescencia de su entorno familiar y comunitario, promoviendo la protección social para el acceso universal a los derechos.

La crisis afectó directamente a 600 niñas, niños y adolescentes, y sus familias. El Estado elaboró un plan de respuesta a corto y mediano plazo incluyendo cinco ejes principales y cuatro acciones complementarias. A ocho meses de la crisis, la respuesta ha sido lenta e incompleta.

Esta crisis y la trágica muerte de 44 niñas, niños y adolescentes mostró la urgente necesidad del país de crear e implementar un sistema integral y coordinado de protección de la infancia, no sólo como respuesta a las 600 víctimas del Hogar, sino que también a los 5,000 institucionalizados, a los más de 40,000 que anualmente son víctimas de delitos y, en definitiva, para los 7 millones de niñas, niños y adolescentes en el país.

Guatemala debe terminar con la mala práctica de la institucionalización de la niñez y abandonar la idea de crear macro instituciones para la protección de la niñez. En cambio, debe invertir en crear programas específicos y diferenciados de protección especial y protección social de acuerdo a las edades, el género, las características y condiciones de la infancia, priorizando siempre a la más vulnerable a causa de la violencia, la discapacidad, género y pobreza.

La sociedad guatemalteca, que sufrió y se indignó ante esta crisis, no debe bajar la guardia, ni olvidar lo sucedido. Todos los sectores deben unirse para exigir y trabajar por una respuesta urgente y contundente para toda la infancia.

Garantizar la protección de toda la niñez y el desarrollo de todo su potencial, en todas partes y siempre, no es opcional ni una ilusión, es su derecho.",269,"Spanish"

El plan elaborado por el Gobierno incluyó cinco ejes principales y cuatro acciones complementarias para dar una respuesta a corto y mediano plazo, conforme a estándares mínimos de protección a la infancia. 

La evaluación del plan por parte de UNICEF a ocho meses de la crisis muestra que en el corto plazo y hasta ahora no se ha dado una respuesta integral y completa a las víctimas y sus familias; y en el mediano plazo los avances están siendo muy lentos para terminar con la institucionalización de la niñez y crear un nuevo sistema de protección a la infancia, eficaz, conforme a los estándares internacionales, homologable con otros países, y basado en el interés superior del niño. 

¨Si bien el Estado acordó un plan de corto y mediano plazo como respuesta a la crisis del Hogar Seguro, su implementación ha sido demasiado lenta e incompleta, frente a las expectativas de las víctimas y sus familias, así como de toda la sociedad. Cada una de las instituciones responsables de atender esta crisis y de velar por la protección de la infancia debe otorgarle la urgencia y la dimensión que merece, porque desnudó una crisis aún mayor, la de todo el sistema como Estado y como sociedad. Hoy, se deben enfrentar las consecuencias de esta crisis, así como las causas que la originaron¨. expresó Carlos Carrera, Representante de UNICEF en Guatemala. 

El informe incluye una serie de recomendaciones a diferentes instancias gubernamentales y grupos de la sociedad civil para retomar con urgencia y determinación la respuesta a la crisis del Hogar Seguro y de todo el sistema de protección de la infancia. 

Entre las principales recomendaciones, UNICEF reitera la necesidad de implementar un plan de des-institucionalización de las niñas, niños y adolescentes (más de 5,000), para asegurar que no se repita lo acontecido en el Hogar Seguro, con un enfoque basado fundamentalmente en el fortalecimiento familiar y comunitario a través de programas de prevención y atención no residencial y acogimiento familiar cuando sea requerido; la aprobación de la Ley del Sistema Nacional de Protección Integral de la Niñez y su implementación efectiva, estableciendo un Sistema de Protección Integral de la Niñez y Adolescencia y asignándole el presupuesto necesario; y la implementación de un sistema de información y registro de las niñas, niños y adolescentes bajo tutela y protección del Estado.

2376099,"Hay que frenar la marea creciente de hambre y obesidad *Este es un artículo de opinión de Federica Damiani, oficial del Programa de Campo de la Oficina Regional de la FAO para América Latina y el Caribe.*

**SANTIAGO, 14 dic 2017 (IPS) -** Nuevas cifras muestran que el hambre creció en América Latina y el Caribe por primera vez desde que la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura (FAO) mide la subalimentación.

El [Panorama de la Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional de América Latina y el Caribe](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/panorama-de-la-seguridad-alimentaria-y-nutricional-en-am-rica-latina-y-el-caribe-2017) 2017, publicado por la FAO y la Organización Panamericana de la Salud (OPS), es el primer informe en reportar el avance de los países hacia los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible— y sus noticias no son buenas.

Luego de que 20 millones de personas superaran el hambre en la región desde comienzos de la década de los noventa, la subalimentación en la región se estancó a partir de 2010 cerca de los cuarenta millones, para luego subir lentamente, como una marea que amenaza anegar la salud de una generación completa de latinoamericanos y caribeños.

Según el Panorama, la situación regional comenzó a deteriorarse en los últimos cuatro años y para 2016 el hambre había alcanzado a 42,5 millones de personas –6,8 por ciento de la población– un aumento de 2,5 millones solo desde el año anterior.

Casi la totalidad del aumento se vio en Sudamérica, que ha sido impactada con fuerza por la desaceleración económica, menores ingresos fiscales y divisas y menores precios de los minerales y del petróleo.

Esto ha reducido los recursos fiscales de los países y erosionado su capacidad de mantener las subvenciones a las necesidades básicas y los programas de protección social en apoyo a los más pobres.

Producto de lo anterior, el hambre en Sudamérica creció 1,5 millones, alcanzando a 21,5 millones de personas en 2016.

A nivel de los países, Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Perú y Venezuela vieron crecer el hambre. De ellos, Venezuela presenta el aumento más significativo – 1,3 millones de personas se han sumado al hambre en dicho país en los últimos años.

En contraste con esta situación, veintiún otros países vieron mejoras en sus índices de seguridad alimentaria y el hambre cayó, marginalmente, tanto en Mesoamérica como el Caribe.

Otro aspecto positivo destacado por el Panorama es que la desnutrición aguda en menores de cinco años se encuentra en niveles bajos y prácticamente todos los países han dado pasos importantes para erradicar la desnutrición infantil crónica. A pesar de eso, si se mantiene el ritmo actual, la región tampoco alcanzará para el 2030 la meta del ODS 2 de este indicador.

La región también ha visto avances considerables en la disminución de la mortalidad materna, neonatal y en menores de 5 años, que permiten augurar que América Latina y el Caribe alcanzará las metas de los ODS relativas a estos indicadores al año 2030.

También se observa una tendencia a la reducción en la mortalidad producto de enfermedades no trasmisibles (ENT), aunque la región tendrá que aumentar su ritmo de disminución si quiere cumplir la meta 3.4 del ODS 3.

Junto con el alza del hambre, debemos considerar el incremento continuo y alarmante de la obesidad y el sobrepeso, sin duda, uno de los principales problemas de salud pública de América Latina y el Caribe. Las enfermedades asociadas al sobrepeso y la obesidad son hoy la causa principal de la mortalidad en nuestra región.

Si América Latina y el Caribe no recupera la tendencia exitosa de la erradicación del hambre que tuvo, e implementa medidas ambiciosas y de gran escala para frenar la epidemia regional de obesidad y sobrepeso, no hay forma de que alcance la meta del ODS 2 de poner fin a la malnutrición al año 2030.

Esta tarea debe ser la primera prioridad, no solo para los gobiernos sino para todos nosotros. El hambre y la obesidad se derrotan trabajando desde el seno de los hogares, uniendo a las comunidades y fortaleciendo sus organizaciones sociales. Requiere también el apoyo de las empresas privadas, especialmente aquellas del sector agro-alimentario, ya que la causa subyacente de ambos fenómenos es la misma.

El hambre y la obesidad son consecuencias de sistemas alimentarios que han vivido rápidas y profundas transformaciones, que han traído múltiples beneficios a nuestros países, pero también han tenido efectos sociales adversos.

Subsanar el daño requiere alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo regional, y pensar las políticas, instituciones, programas e instrumentos necesarios para poner la salud al centro de nuestros sistemas alimentarios.

El panorama regional es también un reflejo de tendencias y desafíos globales de gran escala – como el cambio climático, los conflictos armados y las migraciones – que nos están obligando a replantear la forma en que vivimos.

Pero no debemos caer en la desesperación, ya que la erradicación del hambre es una meta posible. Lo hicimos en el pasado reciente, cuando América Latina y el Caribe se convirtió en un ejemplo para el resto del mundo, y lo podremos volver a hacer. Porque no tenemos que empezar de cero, sino que tenemos un largo camino recorrido.

La región es la única del mundo en tener una estrategia, refrendada por todos sus países, para acabar con el hambre al año 2025: El Plan para la Seguridad Alimentaria, la Nutrición y la Erradicación del Hambre de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (CELAC).

Ha llegado el momento de impulsar con mayor fuerza este acuerdo y dar mayor fuerza a las políticas nacionales a favor de los más pobres.

Solo así podremos dar una respuesta rápida a más de 42 millones que sufren hambre y a 160 millones que viven con obesidad, transformando de forma profunda nuestros sistemas alimentarios para que la forma en que producimos, distribuimos, comercializamos y consumimos alimentos sea verdaderamente justa, sana y sostenible.",269,"Spanish"

En el mes de diciembre ya se registró el primero entre el 9 y el 11, donde la temperatura más baja registrada fue de 6° Celsius en Los Andes, Santa Ana. En enero se esperan dos; para febrero, tres; y en marzo, dos más.

De acuerdo con la perspectiva, la disminución de la temperatura que generen estos Vientos Nortes será ligeramente sobre el promedio al finalizar el cuatrimestre.

Los expertos en meteorología también pronostican la continuidad del fenómeno de La Niña débil debido a que el agua en el océano Pacífico se mantiene frío, lo que podría generar lluvias aisladas de corta duración e intercaladas con días secos.

Estos datos fueron dados a conocer por la ministra de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (MARN), Lina Pohl, y la directora del Observatorio Ambiental, Celina Kattan, quienes presentaron las perspectivas climáticas para el periodo diciembre de 2017 a abril de 2018, donde previo al pronóstico, dieron un balance general sobre el comportamiento meteorológico entre lo que destacaron que:

El 2017 cierra con un promedio de lluvia nacional muy cercano a los históricos. Este dato es importante si se compara con los cinco años anteriores donde se registraron sequías o lluvias deficitarias.

La época lluviosa inicio con normalidad en centro y occidente del país en la primera quincena y en oriente al final del mes.

Hubo una sequía débil del 18 al 24 de julio de 2017, observada principalmente en algunos sectores del occidente y oriente del país.

La finalización de la época lluviosa fue con la llegada de los primeros Nortes entre el 11 y 20 de octubre.

20 ciclones se originaron en el océano Pacífico Oriental de los cuales la Tormenta Tropical Selma impactó por primera vez en la historia moderna a El Salvador.

Mientras que en el océano Atlántico se registraron 17 ciclones tropicales, de los cuales, seis fueron huracanes intensos.

BOGOTÁ, D.C.

La Directora de la Unidad para las Víctimas, Yolanda Pinto Afanador, participó en Nueva York en el evento ‘A World Free of Landmines’ que congregó en el seno de Naciones Unidas a los principales expertos, miembros de ONG y diplomáticos del mundo especializados en la lucha contra estos artefactos.

Durante su presentación, la Directora de la entidad presentó un panorama de la utilización de estos artefactos por parte de grupos armados ilegales durante el prolongado conflicto que vivió el país y el esfuerzo del Gobierno colombiano, de la mano de la comunidad internacional, para luchar contra este flagelo mundial.

“Según el Registro Único de Víctimas, hay 13.000 colombianos afectados por minas antipersona. A ellos les estamos llevándoles atención integral. También desde la entidad que dirijo, hemos logrado indemnizar a 700 de estos colombianos víctimas”, aseguró Pinto.

Al destacar los beneficios que trajo a Colombia la firma, hace un año, del Acuerdo de Paz con la entonces guerrilla de las Farc, la funcionaria explicó las secuelas que sobre las zonas rurales y sus habitantes dejó la utilización de estos artefactos explosivos, cuyo uso está prohibido por el Derecho Internacional Humanitario.

“Hoy, en 535 municipios de Colombia (de los 1.122 del país) hay presencia de minas antipersona. Estamos interviniendo 243 para lograr su desminado y tenemos pendiente por hacerlo en los restantes 292. Con mucho esfuerzo logramos liberar 180 municipios: 23, a través de despeje y 157 con cualificación”.

Tras destacar que gracias al Acuerdo de Paz, el Gobierno ha podido tener acceso a territorios que antes no se podían por las precarias condiciones de seguridad, Pinto dijo que esta situación permitió “reducir el número de víctimas de estas minas”.

Pinto explicó que Colombia tiene una estimación de contaminación de 52 millones de metros cuadrados y que a través de operaciones de Desminado Humanitario y cualificación de información se han podido liberar cerca de 5 millones de metros cuadrados.

En su mensaje a la comunidad internacional, la funcionaria colombiana enfatizó: “Ahora que en Colombia pudimos poner fin al conflicto armado con las Farc, queremos agradecer y a la vez confiar en seguir contando con el acompañamiento de todos ustedes para continuar con esa tarea. No es posible conseguir una paz duradera si persisten las minas antipersona”, concluyó.

La Directora de la Unidad presentó al deportista paraolímpico colombiano Andrés Patiño Luengas, víctima de mina antipersona, quien compartió su experiencia de vida y narró la manera como un artefacto de estos lo afectó siendo soldado profesional y, en especial, la reparación integral que recibió del Estado.

“Fui víctima de una mina. Pero hoy –gracias al apoyo que he recibido de muchas entidades y personas, tengo el orgullo de representar a mi amado país, Colombia, en varias competencias internacionales. Me preparo para participar y triunfar en los Juegos Paralímpicos Tokio 2020”, aseguró.

La Directora de la entidad fue panelista principal del certamen organizado por las misiones de Bélgica, Canadá y Colombia y que contó con la participación de líderes mundiales que combaten las minas antipersona como Llyod Axworthy, ex ministro de relaciones de Canadá.

También estuvo presente, Ágnes Marcaillou, directora de la dependencia de Naciones Unidas contra estas minas (UNMAS); Magdy Martínez-Soliman, director de la Oficina para el Programa de Política de UNDP; y, Jean Van Wetter, director general de Handicap International Bélgica.

Distr. general

11 de diciembre de 2017

Español

Original: inglés

**Carta de fecha 8 de diciembre de 2017 dirigida a la Presidencia del Consejo de Seguridad por el Secretario General** 

Conforme a lo solicitado por el Consejo de Seguridad en su resolución 2381 (2017), tengo el honor de presentarle información actualizada sobre el cumplimiento de las tareas encomendadas en ella a la Misión de Verificación de las Naciones Unidas en Colombia, con respecto al monitoreo y la verificación del cese al fuego bilateral, temporal y nacional entre el Gobierno de Colombia y el Ejército de Liberación Nacional, que entró en vigor el 1 de octubre de 2017. 

Para facilitar la coordinación internacional del Mecanismo de Monitoreo y Verificación, la Misión nombró un equipo directivo encabezado por el General José Mauricio Villacorta Rivas (El Salvador) que incluye a representantes del Gobierno, el Ejército de Liberación Nacional y la Iglesia Católica. La junta nacional del Mecanismo, cuya sede se encuentra en el cuartel general de la Misión en Bogotá, se ha reunido ininterrumpidamente desde comienzos de octubre de 2017 y ha presentado dos informes mensuales sobre sus actividades a los equipos de negociación plenipotenciarios en Quito. 

Recurriendo a otros 70 observadores internacionales y, cuando es posible, al personal civil disponible, la Misión ha desplegado equipos en 30 de los 33 emplazamientos que las partes consideran de especial importancia para el cese al fuego temporal. En el caso de los tres emplazamientos restantes, el personal se desplaza desde las ciudades más cercanas. Cabe señalar que algunas de las zonas donde hay equipos desplegados resultan especialmente problemáticas, tanto por la orografía como por la situación de la seguridad. Este último factor es particularmente importante en zonas que se disputan distintos grupos armados, como sucede en el departamento del Chocó. 

La mayoría de los equipos están compuestos por un civil y dos observadores internacionales no armados (militares o agentes de policía). Las condiciones de trabajo suelen ser precarias; los equipos operan desde hoteles y tienen una capacidad logística limitada. En todos los emplazamientos se ha establecido una cooperación muy satisfactoria con los equipos diocesanos designados por la Iglesia Católica para ayudar a la Misión en su labor. Hasta la fecha, los equipos han llevado a cabo 27 actividades de verificación, y en muchos lugares su presencia ha tenido un efecto tranquilizador en las comunidades. 

A continuación se ofrece un balance del proceso de cese al fuego temporal y la labor del Mecanismo, coincidiendo con el momento en que el Gobierno de Colombia y el Ejército de Liberación Nacional inician su tercer mes de cese al fuego temporal, hasta el 9 de enero de 2018. Hasta ahora, los resultados son positivos en varios sentidos:

a) No se han producido enfrentamientos armados entre las fuerzas armadas de Colombia y las unidades del Ejército de Liberación Nacional, ni este ha perpetrado ataques contra la infraestructura, en marcado contraste con la situación anterior a la entrada en vigor del cese al fuego;

b) Si bien se han confirmado varios incidentes en los que se ha visto implicada la población civil, las comunidades de las zonas afectadas por el conflicto han informado de que la violencia ha disminuido y la situación humanitaria ha mejorado. En una carta dirigida a las partes, el Presidente de la Conferencia Episcopal de Colombia confirmó que se habían notado los efectos del socorro humanitario que esperaban las comunidades, y que la Conferencia Episcopal apoyaba firmemente la prórroga del cese al fuego temporal;

c) Se ha avanzado en la implementación del primer punto del programa de negociación sustantivo, hecho al que debía contribuir el cese al fuego. Con el objetivo de definir la metodología más apropiada para un futuro diálogo nacional, se han llevado a cabo audiencias públicas en las que han participado organizaciones sociales muy diversas. Entre el 31 de octubre y el 16 de noviembre de 2017, 192 representantes de 181 organizaciones participaron en dichas audiencias. El informe conexo, preparado con la ayuda del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo, se envió el 1 de diciembre de 2017 a las partes, que deben decidir sobre las modalidades de participación de los ciudadanos en el proceso de paz. Está previsto que la próxima sesión de negociación comience el 9 de enero de 2018.  

A pesar de estas circunstancias favorables, se ha informado de varios incidentes, algunos de los cuales se han confirmado, y el Mecanismo ha tenido dificultades para cumplir su mandato en cuanto a la coordinación de los movimientos de tropas de ambas partes, y a la prevención y la verificación de incidentes.  

Estas dificultades se explican por dos factores. Uno de ellos es que persisten las diferencias entre las partes en cuanto a la interpretación de los actos prohibidos en virtud del Acuerdo de Quito y, por consiguiente, las diferencias de interpretación respecto al alcance del mandato del Mecanismo. El otro factor son las dificultades con que se han encontrado los equipos de las Naciones Unidas para acceder a zonas de conflicto muy remotas, donde las personas y las comunidades afectadas por la violencia suelen ser reacias a facilitar información por temor a represalias y donde, en consecuencia, la verificación depende de fuentes indirectas y menos fiables.  

Esas dificultades no eran inesperadas, dado que se trata del primer cese al fuego bilateral jamás pactado entre el Gobierno y el Ejército de Liberación Nacional, y que el acuerdo no abarca algo tan importante como la separación de las fuerzas. También hay que tener presente que la negociación política no ha hecho más que comenzar, que es la primera vez que las Naciones Unidas están presentes de forma continua en muchas de las zonas de conflicto, y que es la primera vez que la Iglesia Católica y la Misión colaboran tan estrechamente. Si bien el proceso es por tanto incipiente en casi todos sus aspectos, hemos observado algunos progresos entre octubre y noviembre de 2017 en lo tocante a la relación entre las partes, el carácter constructivo de su diálogo y las actividades de los equipos de verificación de la Misión. La tarea que tenemos por delante, como reconocen todos los miembros del Mecanismo, consiste precisamente en lograr que el Mecanismo sea más eficaz y, por tanto, un mejor instrumento para fomentar la confianza entre las partes.",269,"Spanish"
2375924,"Fiebre Amarilla – Actualización Epidemiológica al 13 de diciembre de 2017 **Resumen de la situación en las Américas** 

Entre enero de 2016 y diciembre de 2017, siete países y territorios de la región de las Américas han notificado casos confirmados de fiebre amarilla: El Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, Brasil,  
Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana Francesa, Perú y Suriname. Durante este periodo, se notificó el mayor número de casos humanos y epizootias registrada en la Región de las Américas en décadas. El incremento observado está relacionado tanto al ecosistema favorable que propició la diseminación del virus así como a la existencia de población no inmunizada. 

Desde la Actualización Epidemiológica de fiebre amarilla publicada por la Organización Panamericana de la Salud / Organización Mundial de la Salud (OPS/ OMS) el 27 de octubre de 2017, Brasil y Perú notificaron casos nuevos de fiebre amarilla. A continuación se presenta un resumen de la situación en ambos países. 

En Brasil, después del brote de fiebre amarilla registrado entre el segundo semestre de 2016 a junio 2017 con 779 casos confirmados, 262 defunciones y 1.659 epizootias1; sobrevino un periodo con escasa transmisión en humanos. En efecto, se notificaron casos confirmados en las semanas epidemiológicas (SE) 28, SE 38 y SE 40 de 2017 en el estado de São Paulo (2 casos) y en el estado de Rio de Janeiro (1 caso). Los casos confirmados en São Paulo, uno en la SE 38 y otro en la SE 40 (caso fatal que corresponde a un hombre de 76 años2,3), tienen como lugar probable de infección el municipio de Itatiba. El caso en Rio de Janeiro tiene como lugar probable de infección el municipio de Guapimirim4. En la Figura 1 se muestra la distribución de los casos confirmados entre la SE 1 de 2016 y la SE 49 de 2017. 

Adicionalmente, las autoridades de Brasil informaron sobre un caso en investigación con lugar probable de infección en Brasilia, Distrito Federal, en un área de ocurrencia de epizootias1; así como dos casos bajo investigación en el estado de Rio Grande do Sul y otros dos en Santa Catarina. Otros 37 casos continúan en investigación en otros estados.  

Considerando que una década atrás, el brote de fiebre amarilla y la onda epizootica que había afectado el sudeste y sur de Brasil alcanzó posteriormente a Argentina y Paraguay; es necesario realizar un minucioso seguimiento del comportamiento de la fiebre amarilla en el sur y sudeste de Brasil durante el periodo 2017-2018.",269,"Spanish"

2375864,"Colombia implementará plan maestro de alcantarillado en Mocoa con apoyo del BID **Préstamo por US$30 millones financiará mejoras a las condiciones sanitarias y ambientales para 10 mil hogares en el área urbana del municipio de Mocoa**

Colombia emprenderá un proyecto para implementar la primera etapa del [plan maestro de alcantarillado del municipio de Mocoa](http://www.iadb.org/es/proyectos/project-information-page,1303.html?id=CO-L1232), con un préstamo de US$30 millones del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID).

El proyecto forma parte de un plan comprensivo de recuperación de la ciudad que está desarrollando el gobierno y que incluye las acciones de prevención necesarias para evitar repetir la tragedia que vivió Mocoa en 2017.

El programa busca mejorar las condiciones sanitarias y ambientales del área urbana del municipio, en donde 2 mil hogares tendrán acceso a la red de alcantarillado por primera vez. Adicionalmente, el proyecto brindará acceso mejorado a la red de alcantarillado sanitario a 8 mil hogares.

Se espera que al final de las obras, en un plazo de cinco años, cerca del 80 por ciento de las aguas residuales provenientes de los 10 mil hogares beneficiados sean procesadas en una planta de tratamiento antes de ser vertidas en los ríos Sangoyaco, Mulato y Mocoa, dentro del área urbana del municipio.

El proyecto será ejecutado por el Ministerio de vivienda, ciudad y territorio (MVCT), y contempla la elaboración de los estudios y diseños de las obras, lo cual incluye la actualización del plan maestro de alcantarillado del Mocoa. Asimismo, se prevé construir colectores, interceptores y sistemas de bombeo, e instalar y rehabilitar conexiones domiciliarias a la red de alcantarillado sanitario; además se financiará la construcción y equipamiento de una planta de tratamiento de aguas residuales.

El proyecto también incluirá el fortalecimiento de la capacidad institucional de los organismos operadores, así como actividades de educación sanitaria y ambiental para la población, que incluye: hábitos de higiene, socialización sobre el pago del servicio y conexión a la red de alcantarillado

El préstamo tiene una tasa de interés basada en LIBOR y será desembolsado en un periodo de cinco años, y tendrá como plazo de amortización hasta el 15 de julio de 2030.

2375774,"#NoMásInundados: Familias de la Chacarita comenzaron a mudarse a sus nuevos hogares en el barrio San Francisco Este martes 12 de diciembre, personal operativo de la Secretaría de Emergencia Nacional (SEN) brindó apoyo logístico para el traslado de las primeras 13 familias en mudarse al nuevo barrio San Francisco, en inmediaciones del Jardín Botánico. Los beneficiarios, que pasan de una zona vulnerable a inundaciones a un barrio modelo para el país, recibieron las llaves de sus viviendas de mano del presidente de la República, Horacio Cartes.

A tempranas horas de ayer, camiones institucionales llegaron hasta el barrio Ricardo Brugada (Chacarita) para ayudar en la mudanza de los bienes de las familias hasta sus nuevos hogares. Alrededor de las 10 de la mañana, partió la caravana de las primeras familias, junto con sus bienes, rumbo al barrio San Francisco, construido como “un nuevo modelo de ciudad”.
 
El proyecto habitacional presentado por la Secretaría Nacional de la Vivienda y el Hábitat (Senavitat), está ejecutado en un predio de más de 20 hectáreas, y brindará soluciones definitivas a familias de cinco barrios de la zona inundable de la Chacarita y zonas de riesgo de Zeballos Cué.
 
Entre las obras complementarias ya concluidas se encuentran la Subcomisaría, la Unidad de Salud Familiar, la planta de tratamiento de efluentes, el salón de usos múltiples, el Centro Comunitario, el sistema de iluminación LED con cableado subterráneo, un tanque elevado de agua potable, con una capacidad de 850 mil litros, entre otros, según datos publicados por la Senavitat. 
 
En la ocasión, el presidente Cartes dio la bienvenida a las primeras familias en llegar al barrio San Francisco, y exteriorizó su alegría al hacer entrega de las llaves a los propietarios de las modernas viviendas. Aseveró que es una de las tantas obras emblemáticas de su Gobierno, construidas para las familias carenciadas que permanentemente sufren las consecuencias de la crecida del río Paraguay e inundaciones súbitas con intensas precipitaciones. 
 
“No sabía de este protocolo, solo invite a los compañeros de trabajo para mostrar lo que consideramos una obra emblemática, pero por encima de lo material -la casa, los departamentos-, el valor que tiene lo vemos mejor expresado en lo que ellos escriben acá, el sentimiento que tienen”, expresó el mandatario, señalando hacia un mural con dibujos e imágenes preparados por algunas familias beneficiadas.
 
Sin embargo, se mostró apenado al no poder cumplir con todos; indicó que cada vez que se entregan viviendas, siempre hay un sabor agridulce, porque “siempre faltan más”. No obstante, recalcó que “esta semilla del barrio San Francisco ya germinó”,y que “lo único importante es la gente; devolver la dignidad que merece cada uno de ustedes”. “Este dinero que hoy empieza a llegar a la gente es el dinero que era permanentemente robado por los gobiernos de turno (...) el dinero de la gente tiene que seguir llegando a la gente”, expresó finalmente.
 
El operativo de mudanza  proyectado para el mes de diciembre contempla el traslado de unas 10 a 15 familias por día, movilizando a unas 400 personas, de manera articulada con varias instituciones estatales. Un total de 1 000 viviendas, 888 departamentos y 112 viviendas unifamiliares beneficiarán a familias de la Chacarita Baja (San Pedro, San Felipe, San Jorge, San Vicente y Refugio) y zonas vulnerables de Zeballos Cué, quienes preparan su última mudanza, como solución definitiva para la problemática de las inundaciones.

**“Mi familia está muy feliz con la nueva casa”**

Así se expresó Daniel Franco, reposando en la sombra de su nueva casa, acompañado de su familia. Mencionó que vivió en el barrio San Vicente por 22 años, tiempo en el cual sufrieron la crecida del río y la caída intensa de lluvias, que generaron varias afectaciones de sus bienes. “Nuestra nueva vivienda nos queda mejor, para mi trabajo, la escuela de los niños y principalmente porque ya no sufriremos ninguna inundación”, comentó.
 
En tal sentido, agradeció al presidente de la República y a las instituciones públicas involucradas en este proyecto, por el gesto hacia los habitantes ribereños; “por ver la pobreza de nuestra gente y por el esfuerzo realizado para que se cumpla este sueño”. 

**""Demasiada emoción""**

Por su parte, doña María Guillermina Mercedes Cabrera, quien también recibió las llaves de su nueva vivienda este martes, comentó que en San Vicente debían mudarse constantemente por las inundaciones, que también afectaron a sus hijos debido al traslado constante hasta los refugios habilitados por el Estado. Explicó que a través del censo de Senavitat logró ser seleccionada para cumplir con el sueño de la casa propia, y que durante todo el proceso nunca fue consultada sobre sus preferencias políticas.
 
Minutos después de recibir su vivienda, la señora Cabrera expresaba que ya ni recordaba lo que le dijo el presidente Cartes al entregarle las llaves. “Tengo mi casa propia después de 20 años de vivir pendiente de las inundaciones, de las lluvias y los raudales que dañaban todas mis cosas. (...) Ya me olvidé de lo que me dijo el presidente… demasiada emoción”, compartió, con la felicidad dibujada en su rostro y en el de sus familiares.",269,"Spanish"

**Validez: del jueves 14 al sábado 16 de diciembre** 

**Zona: Norte, parte del Litoral, Centro-Sur y parte del Este del país.**
  
**Análisis:**
 
Debido a la persistencia de vientos del sector norte, la escasez de precipitaciones de los últimos días y la poca nubosidad se prevén altas temperaturas y sensaciones térmicas para los próximos tres días:  

Artigas (Todo el departamento) 
 
Cerro Largo (Todo el departamento)  

Durazno (Todo el departamento)  

Flores : Andresito, Ismael Cortinas, Juan José Castro y Trinidad.  

Lavalleja : José Pedro Varela.

Rivera (Todo el departamento)  

Salto (Todo el departamento)  

Soriano : Dolores, José Enrique Rodó, Mercedes y Palmitas.  

Tacuarembó (Todo el departamento)  

Treinta y Tres (Todo el departamento)  

Sobre las áreas afectadas entre el día de mañana jueves 14 y el sábado 16, se esperan temperaturas mínimas entre 20°C a 22°C y máximas entre 33°C a 35°C. Esto no implica que no exista la posibilidad de registros aún más altos ya que el valor máximo es un promedio de toda la región.  

Si bien en primavera y verano puede haber temperaturas altas, para que se produzca una ola de calor deben darse algunas condiciones atmosféricas:  

Las temperaturas máximas y mínimas deben superar ciertos umbrales de cada región del país por durante tres días consecutivos.  

Es destacar que la temperatura mínima se considera en esta definición debido al efecto biológico que tiene en los seres humanos y animales ya que si las mínimas están altas no refresca por la noche.  

Por último, cabe agregar, que si bien se registraron temperaturas máximas en los últimos días, en prácticamente todo el territorio uruguayo, las mínimas no han alcanzado los umbrales de ola de calor, registrándose cercanas a los 14 y 16 °C.  

En la zona costera no se espera que las máximas alcancen registros elevados debido al probable efecto de la brisa de mar.",269,"Spanish"

- **Cruz Roja se encarga de la primera asistencia humanitaria de migrantes y refugiados que llegan a nuestras costas o que precisan atención a pie de valla en el caso de Ceuta y Melilla.**  

Los Equipos de Respuesta Inmediata en Emergencias (ERIE) de Ayuda Humanitaria a Inmigrantes han atendido este año a 22.560 personas llegadas a nuestras costas y a Ceuta y Melilla. Se trata de más del doble de todas las intervenciones llevadas a cabo durante 2016 (10.389).  

Los equipos de Cruz Roja, integrados por cerca de 2.000 personas voluntarias, se despliegan ante la llegada de pateras a las costas españolas y ofrecen ayuda básica (ropa, mantas, alimentos, ktis higiénicos…) y atención sociosanitaria a estas personas en situación de extrema vulnerabilidad, que llegan en embarcaciones muy precarias, con problemas de deshidratación, hipotermia y heridas causadas durante la travesía.  

Los Equipos de Cruz Roja buscan además situaciones de riesgo especiales, como la identificación de posibles víctimas de trata de seres humanos o de necesidad de protección internacional.  

Los ERIES son un modelo de respuesta especializada ante situaciones de emergencia diseñado para atender las necesidades de las víctimas mediante la ejecución de tareas necesarias y adecuadas a estas necesidades. Su objetivo es poner a disposición de la administración un conjunto de capacidades que permitan colaborar en la minimización de los efectos de las emergencias y/o crisis, aliviando el sufrimiento humano, protegiendo la salud y el medio ambiente. Cruz Roja dispone actualmente de 70 ERIES (9 de ellas, de Ayuda Humanitaria a Inmigrantes).

**100.000 personas inmigrantes atendidas anualmente** 

La atención a las personas inmigrantes es una de las prioridades que tiene Cruz Roja Española en virtud de su compromiso con las personas vulnerables.  

Cruz Roja atiende anualmente a unas 100.000 personas inmigrantes a través de distintos programas, como la acogida integral o la lucha contra la Trata de Seres Humanos.  

Y, entre las personas migrantes, uno de los grupos más vulnerables son aquellas personas que huyen de conflictos armados o de situaciones de violencia, personas refugiadas o solicitantes de asilo.  

En España, Cruz Roja cuenta con 2.208 plazas de acogida en 44 provincias para estas personas solicitantes de asilo. No obstante, seguimos trabajando para ampliar nuestra red hasta las 2.500 plazas.

**En reunión encabezada por el Coordinador del Instituto de Protección Civil, Jorge Mier y Terán Suárez, se informó que se prevé potencial de precipitaciones ligeras a moderadas y temperaturas mínimas de los 14 a 16°C en lo que resta del mes de diciembre.**

**Villahermosa, Tabasco.-** Ante los efectos del Frente Frío N.15 en la entidad tabasqueña, la Comisión Estatal de Fenómenos Hidrometeorológicos, que está integrada por autoridades de los tres órdenes de gobierno, sesionó este miércoles para analizar, de manera preventiva, las condiciones meteorológicas que se esperan en esta temporada invernal en la región.

La subgerencia técnica de la Dirección Local de la Comisión Nacional del Agua (Conagua), informó que, con el avance del frente frío, para este sábado podrían presentarse lluvias en el orden de los 50 a 75 milímetros en la región y condiciones frescas.

Además, se prevé potencial de precipitaciones ligeras a moderadas y temperaturas mínimas por el orden de los 14 a 16°C en lo que resta del mes de diciembre ante la incursión de masa de aire polar ártico. 

Estas condiciones metereologicas informó que podrían contribuir para llegar, por lo menos, al 50 por ciento de la precipitación media mensual prevista para este mes, que asciende a 185.4 milímetros.


Después de explicar el comportamiento actual de la temporada ciclónica 2017 en el atlántico y el pacífico, el encargado de la subgerencia técnica, Luis Antonio Cabrera, señaló que al final del año se deberían estar registrando alrededor de 2 mil 400 milímetros de lluvias tras la incursión de ocho frentes fríos.

De estos frentes fríos, sólo se ha tenido registro de dos, sin embargo, hasta este miércoles trece de diciembre se ha registrado mil 810 milímetros, por lo que sería muy probable que el 2017 represente el sexto o séptimo año más seco de la historia.

Según las previsiones del Sistema Meteorológico Nacional (SMN), para el mes de enero del 2018, se espera la presencia de una condición seca, es decir, que se den lluvias muy por debajo de la precipitación media mensual estimada en 180 milímetros; se prevé que sólo se alcance entre 80 y 90 milímetros de lluvias aun cuando se estima la presencia de siete frentes fríos.

Presente en la reunión, el Ingeniero Francisco Nicolás Nájera Blanco, jefe del departamento Regional de Hidrometría de la subgerencia Regional Hidroeléctrica de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad, señaló que en todo el año la operación de las presas se ha desarrollado en condiciones normales y actualmente se cuenta con una reserva de almacenamiento para el próximo periodo de estiaje.

Asimismo, detalló que actualmente la política de extracción de la presa peñitas es de un gasto promedio de 400 m3/s semanal, con gasto mínimo de 300 m3/s y máximo de 600 m3/s diario, medidas tomadas con la intención de mantener niveles de las presas Angostura y Malpaso, principalmente.

Mirian Cisneros, presidenta de Sarayaku, destacó muy emocionada que es la segunda vez en más de diez años que son visitados por un ministro de gobierno para conocer más sobre su identidad, trabajar con ellos y unirlos a los proyectos de Estado.

“Los invitamos a que siempre nos visiten, estaremos gustosos de recibirlos. Llévele mi saludo y agradecimiento al Presidente Lenín Moreno”, añadió la dirigente.

El Prefecto, en su intervención, manifestó que se unieron a esta iniciativa de la SGR porque parte de sus competencias se centran en la gestión de riesgos, más aún al tratarse de un producto intercultural.

Durante la presentación del Plan Familiar de Emergencias en lengua nativa, la Ministra Ocles enfatizó que trabajar en la comunidad Sarayaku, representa un espacio histórico de resistencia y lucha para la defensa de su identidad. “Lo que hoy estamos presentando a ustedes reivindica sus derechos y marca el inicio del diálogo con su pueblo. Sepan que jamás se vulneraremos su derecho a la participación”, aseguró.

Dentro del plan familiar se consideraron escenarios propios de su territorio amazónico, como las amenazas a las que están expuestos (deslizamientos, vendavales, sismos, incendios estructurales e inundaciones); el reconocimiento del entorno donde viven sus familias; la identificación de las rutas de evacuación y zonas seguras; y, además transmitirles la importancia de contar siempre con una mochila de emergencia.

Para la ejecución de este proyecto, la SGR recibió el apoyo de la Gobernación de Pastaza, la Prefectura y el Municipio, y sobre todo la colaboración del pueblo originario de Sarayacu, perteneciente a la parroquia Sarayacu.

La comunidad y la parroquia Sarayaku, ubicadas en la cuenca del río Bobonaza, se asientan en sitios históricamente propensos a padecer inundaciones en la época de lluvias, ante esto se estima que el plan familiar presentado beneficie alrededor de 1.000 personas.

Finalizada la presentación, la Secretaria de Gestión de Riesgos entregó mochilas de emergencia equipadas para acciones respuesta a los voluntarios integrantes del grupo WIO, como una muestra de compromiso para seguir trabajando de manera coordinada.",269,"Spanish"
2374139,"Desplazamiento forzado en Chiapas: La protección de la infancia es el deber de todos los involucrados en el conflicto *UNICEF exhorta a la resolución pacífica del conflicto en Chenalhó y Chalchihuitán y a cumplir con el deber de velar por la integridad física y emocional de niñas, niños y adolescentes afectados.*

**Ciudad de México, 12 de diciembre de 2017 –** UNICEF, el Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia, señaló hoy que el desplazamiento forzado de familias en Chiapas, obligadas a vivir en condiciones infrahumanas como resultado del conflicto territorial entre las comunidades de Chenalhó y Chalchihuitán, somete a sus miembros más jóvenes a riesgos inaceptables.

Esta preocupación de UNICEF ha quedado tristemente demostrada en la declaración del Presidente Municipal de Chalchihuitán, según la cual ya ha muerto un bebé de tan sólo tres días de nacido y tres niñas menores de cuatro años de edad (además de dos adultos mayores) debido al frío y a la escasez de alimentos en la zona en donde las familias afectadas se han visto forzadas a buscar refugio.

“Es absolutamente inaceptable que hoy en día, en México, mueran niños de hambre y de frío,” señaló Christian Skoog, Representante de UNICEF en el país.

“Desde UNICEF pedimos a todo actor involucrado en el conflicto que piense como ser humano, como padre, como madre o hermano, y que coloque el deber de proteger a la infancia al centro de sus consideraciones y acciones respetando el principio del interés superior de la niñez que está establecido en el artículo 4to de la Constitución de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos.”

Las bajas temperaturas, el poco o nulo acceso a agua potable, la insalubridad en materia de higiene y saneamiento, los brotes de enfermedades y el peligro constante que los acecha, amenazan las vidas de más de 5,000 mil personas desplazadas, entre ellas más de 2,000 niños, niñas y adolescentes y más de 100 mujeres embarazadas, según reportan actores de la sociedad civil presentes en la zona.

El escalamiento de tensiones ha llevado, además, a la suspensión de clases en la zona desde el 18 de octubre y al cierre de caminos de acceso hacia otras áreas, perjudicando no solo a la población desplazada, sino también a la población receptora, por ejemplo porque no pueden trasladarse a sus escuelas o porque existe un desabasto de productos y servicios que podría afectar también su salud y bienestar.

“Lo que están viviendo miles de niños y niñas en Chiapas es intolerable, ya que están muy asustados y son altamente vulnerables”, enfatizó Skoog.

De acuerdo con información proporcionada por las organizaciones locales, la asistencia humanitaria ha sido insuficiente y el acceso restringido. Si bien la mayoría de los desplazados se han refugiado en la cabecera municipal de Chalchihuitán, más de 1,000 personas (de las cuales casi la mitad son niños) permanecen refugiados a la intemperie en las montañas, lo que los coloca en una situación de mayor vulnerabilidad.

La situación, señala UNICEF, requiere de soluciones integrales a corto, mediano y largo plazo que aborden las causas subyacentes del conflicto, permitan la implementación de medidas urgentes de protección (tal como lo establece la Ley General de Derechos de Niñas, Niños y Adolescentes), faciliten el pronto regreso de los afectados a sus hogares y garanticen su seguridad a todo nivel.

“Reestablecer el libre tránsito para garantizar el acceso de la ayuda humanitaria y aplicar de inmediato los Principios Rectores de los Desplazamientos Internos de la Organización de Las Naciones Unidas, la Ley para la Prevención y Atención del Desplazamiento Interno en el Estado de Chiapas y la Ley Estatal de Derechos de los Niños, Niñas y Adolescentes del Estado de Chiapas, son medidas de importancia vital en este momento”, señaló Skoog.

“En situaciones de conflicto como ésta en Chiapas, los niños, niñas y adolescentes son siempre los más afectados. Debemos trabajar juntos para proteger su acceso a agua potable, alimentos, servicios de salud y atención psicosocial, etc. Sólo así podrán sobrellevar las consecuencias del conflicto y volver de inmediato a las condiciones de normalidad, al juego y al aprendizaje escolar”.

UNICEF apela a los tres niveles de gobierno y a los actores del conflicto a que continúen los esfuerzos por encontrar una resolución que ponga en el centro del diálogo la protección y el interés superior de la infancia. La organización reitera su disposición para brindar el apoyo y la asesoría técnica necesarios para garantizar los derechos de la infancia y la adolescencia durante este proceso.

SAN LUIS, Argentina, 13 de diciembre de 2017 (ACNUR) - En el marco del Programa Especial de Visado Humanitario para Extranjeros afectados por el conflicto de la República Árabe de Siria, más conocido como “Programa Siria”, arribaron en el día de ayer cinco familias sirias a la Ciudad de San Luis, en donde las 18 personas, entre adultos y niños, podrán tener la oportunidad de reconstruir sus vidas.

Este Programa, creado en 2014, tomó un nuevo impulso a partir de la voluntad manifiesta del Presidente Mauricio Macri de recibir a 3.000 ciudadanos sirios durante los próximos años, anuncio que realizó durante la Cumbre de Naciones Unidas sobre Refugiados y Migrantes celebrada en Nueva York en septiembre de 2016.

Desde mediados del 2017, ACNUR y OIM están apoyando la implementación del Programa, en particular en lo que refiere a la identificación, traslado e integración de estas familias en Argentina; acciones que son llevadas adelante en el marco del Mecanismo de Apoyo Conjunto para Países de Reasentamiento Emergentes (ERCM, por sus siglas en inglés). Este mecanismo, liderado por ambas agencias, ha sido creado para ofrecer apoyo técnico y financiero a países emergentes con interés en establecer o fortalecer sus programas de reasentamiento.

Dentro del Programa Siria, las personas “llamantes” u organizaciones “requirentes” cumplen un papel fundamental al asumir el compromiso de brindar alojamiento y manutención de forma voluntaria a las personas beneficiarias provenientes de Siria, con el fin de acompañar su proceso de integración para llegar a ser autosuficientes, por el término de doce meses o un plazo menor en caso que los beneficiarios cuenten con los medios suficientes para su auto sustentabilidad.

Los “llamantes” o “requirentes” pueden ser personas privadas, familias, organizaciones de la sociedad civil, e incluso instituciones o entes del Estado (como es el caso de la Provincia de San Luis).

Gracias a la solidaridad de la sociedad argentina, se espera que en los próximos meses otras familias también sean recibidas en diversas partes del país, como en la Ciudad y Provincia de Buenos Aires, Córdoba, La Rioja, Mendoza, San Luis y Santiago del Estero.

Según cifras del Gobierno argentino, entre 2014 y noviembre de 2017, un total de  318 personas  llegaron a la Argentina, de las cuales 155 lo ha hecho durante 2017.

ACNUR y OIM continuarán apoyando el Programa Siria a través del ERCM, fortaleciendo la capacidad institucional, y apoyando el proceso de selección, el traslado, la recepción e integración de los refugiados sirios en Argentina.",269,"Spanish"

2374104,"Miles de niños y niñas siguen necesitando ayuda tres meses después de que los huracanes devastaran las islas del Caribe **CIUDAD DE PANAMÁ, 13 de diciembre de 2017 -** Tres meses después de que dos huracanes de categoría 5, Irma y María, barrieran el Caribe causando víctimas mortales y daños generalizados, miles de niños y niñas siguen necesitando ayuda en toda la región.

Irma, el huracán más poderoso jamás registrado en el Océano Atlántico, causó grandes daños en las islas del Caribe Oriental, Haití y Cuba. Días después, el huracán María causó daños adicionales en toda la zona. Ambos huracanes dejaron a 350.000 niños y niñas necesitados de asistencia humanitaria, según las estimaciones de UNICEF.

“Incluso antes de que llegaran los huracanes, UNICEF estaba sobre el terreno, trabajando con los gobiernos y los socios locales para preparar a las comunidades y preposicionar suministros humanitarios en las áreas de mayor riesgo”, aseguró María Cristina Perceval, Directora Regional de UNICEF para América Latina y el Caribe. “La ayuda humanitaria fue esencial para salvar vidas durante la respuesta inmediata, cuando el acceso a agua potable, refugio y servicios sociales eran escasos”.

“Tres meses después, UNICEF sigue trabajando en estos países y territorios, trabajando en programas para apoyar a niños, niñas y familias en la reconstrucción de sus vidas y para que puedan recuperar la normalidad”, añadió Perceval.

Mientras se recupera la normalidad para muchos de los niños, niñas y familias afectadas, los desafíos continúan y muchas de las familias más vulnerables siguen sintiendo los efectos de los huracanes.
En Dominica, más del 35 por ciento de los niños y niñas, especialmente los que viven en albergues, aún no se han inscrito en actividades educativas. En Antigua y Barbuda, muchos niños, niñas y familias permanecen en refugios y no pueden regresar a sus hogares.

UNICEF no solo ha proporcionado ayuda humanitaria inmediata a las poblaciones afectadas, sino que también ha trabajado, en colaboración con los gobiernos y organizaciones aliadas, para garantizar la recuperación y la resiliencia a más largo plazo.

“Si bien la vida está volviendo a la normalidad para muchos, los niños, niñas y las familias que han vivido estas tormentas necesitarán un apoyo comprometido y sostenido para que sus hogares, comunidades y vidas vuelvan a la normalidad”, agregó Perceval.

UNICEF, en colaboración con los gobiernos y aliados, ha podido apoyar a los niños, niñas, familias y las comunidades mediante programas centrados en la recuperación y la resiliencia, que incluyen:

**Anguila**

Apoyo a las actividades de capacitación dirigidas por los Ministerios de Salud, Educación y Desarrollo Humano. Todos los maestros de preescolar ahora están capacitados en el programa ‘Retorno a la Alegría’ adaptado para niños pequeños y sus cuidadores.

**Antigua y Barbuda**

Ayuda a la integración de niños y niñas desplazados de Barbuda en el sistema educativo de Antigua. Sobre la base de las necesidades identificadas, y en coordinación con el Ministerio de Educación, UNICEF proporciona materiales y orientación para docentes y asesores.

Mejora de los servicios de protección de la infancia en Barbuda, donde se espera que los niños desplazados regresen de Antigua en los próximos meses, incluyendo el desarrollo de actividades psicosociales y de fomento de la resiliencia adaptadas para su edad.

**Islas Vírgenes Británicas**

Apoyo al Ministerio de Educación en la reapertura de las escuelas a través de asistencia técnica y de recuperación. Cinco escuelas primarias y una escuela técnica recibieron generadores.

BARRANCABERMEJA
La Unidad para las Víctimas a través de la dirección territorial en el Magdalena Medio acompañó al corregimiento ribereño de Ciénaga del Opón a la celebración del día del Retorno, en el marco de la conmemoración del Día Internacional de los Derechos Humanos.

La actividad, que fue desarrollada como implementación de una medida de satisfacción del Plan Integral del Sujeto de Reparación Colectiva (SRC) perteneciente al municipio de Barrancabermeja, contó con la asistencia de aproximadamente 500 personas de las siete veredas del corregimiento, quienes participaron activamente del evento.

La agenda de la celebración dio inicio con una oración y posteriormente se escuchó palabras de diferentes instituciones y personalidades invitadas, posteriormente se realizó el acto de dignificación que fue concertado con antelación con los miembros del SRC y que consistió en la preparación de un pequeño mural y un recorrido corto, en motorcanoa, arrojando pétalos al río Magdalena con el fin de recordar el momento en que retornaron, desde hace dos años a su corregimiento, después del desplazamiento forzado ocurrido en el año 2000.

Este momento estuvo cargado de diversas emociones y sentimientos, por un lado, dolor al recordar la pérdida de sus seres queridos que ya no están presentes a causa del conflicto y por otro lado expresaron felicidad por estar de nuevo en su territorio y tener esperanza de que se mantendrá ese ambiente de paz y podrán vivir tranquilamente sin ninguna clase de zozobra.

Posteriormente se continuó con la realización de dos juegos típicos de los pescadores, como lo son el canotaje y los corrales, momento que sirvió también para dignificar y rememorar, esto con el fin de seguir trabajando por la recuperación total aplicación de estas prácticas.

Para el almuerzo se realizó una olla comunitaria y una carne llanera, momento en el que tanto instituciones como los integrantes del SRC se integraron en el momento de la preparación y del disfrute al consumir estos manjares culinarios.

Está celebración del día del retorno en el corregimiento de Ciénaga del Opón también contó con el acompañamiento de la Gobernación de Santander, el Programa de Desarrollo y Paz del Magdalena Medio y a la Mesa Municipal de Participación, quienes se integraron activamente en las diversas actividades que se realizaron en el marco del evento.

Para finalizar fueron entregados los premios a los equipos ganadores de las actividades desarrolladas en el río, y la Gobernación de Santander logró un espacio en el que presentó a 'María Paz', personaje que recorre el departamento hablando de paz y reconciliación, y que esta a su vez pudiera escuchar a los niños y recoger insumos para poder aportar a la construcción del Protocolo de Participación de Niños, Niñas y Adolescentes Víctimas del Conflicto.

En un comunicado enviado hoy (lunes 11), la embajada de Chile en Portugal detalló que estuvieron en Lisboa el subdirector de operaciones de ONEMI, Juan Claudio Aldea; el jefe de Protección contra Incendios Forestales de CONAF, Raúl Molina, y el segundo comandante del Cuerpo de Bomberos de Talcahuano, Paolo Fregonara.

Tras la reunión, la delegación chilena fue recibida, junto al embajador de Chile en Portugal, Germán Guerrero, por el secretario de Estado de Protección Civil portugués, José Artur Neves, para informarle de los avances alcanzados.

“Portugal fue muy solidario al enviar a Chile en enero pasado una brigada de bomberos para ayudarnos a combatir los graves incendios que afectaron a nuestro país, y estamos muy agradecidos por ese gesto”, señaló el embajador chileno, que añadió que “estas reuniones vienen a ratificar la estrecha cooperación entre ambos países”.

Por su parte, el portugués Neves resaltó “la importancia de estas reuniones de especialistas en el ámbito de la instalación del nuevo sistema de gestión integrada de fuegos rurales en Portugal”, así como para “dar expresión a las extraordinarias relaciones de cooperación entre los dos países”.

Ambos países sufrieron en 2017 las peores tragedias forestales de su historia.

En enero y febrero de este año, una oleada de incendios azotó varias regiones de Chile y dejó once muertos y más de 500.000 hectáreas quemadas.

En Portugal, los fuegos arrasaron cerca de 450.000 hectáreas y dejaron un total de 109 muertos, entre la tragedia de Pedrógão Grande en junio y la oleada de incendios de mediados de octubre. EFE",269,"Spanish"

Con el propósito de detectar velozmente talas o quemas ilegales en áreas de difícil acceso para el ser humano, aumentar la extensión de las inspecciones prediales y contar con imágenes y videos para respaldar acciones legales ante posibles delitos ambientales, la Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF) adquirió una flota de 15 drones de última generación, avaluada en cerca de 30 millones de pesos.

El organismo forestal hizo entrega oficial de cuatro de estos aparatos a cada una de las oficinas regionales de Biobío, La Araucanía, Los Ríos y Los Lagos, sumándose a los que la semana pasada entregó en la zona centro del país, en una actividad realizada en centro de eventos San Pablo, de la comuna de Cunco, que contó con la participación de autoridades y de los fiscalizadores de CONAF que utilizarán esta nueva herramienta tecnológica.

Al respecto, el gerente de fiscalización y evaluación ambiental de CONAF, Rodrigo Henríquez, “está en el contexto de la modernización de la gestión de CONAF en fiscalización, ya que días atrás lanzamos el sistema de alerta temprana, con la utilización de imágenes satelitales, a lo que hoy estamos sumando los drones, que son un aliado en la fiscalización forestal, ya que el objetivo principal es detectar las pérdidas de bosques en tiempo real”.

Además, precisó que “los drones tienen la particularidad de uso multivariable, si bien nos permiten detectar cortas ilegales, también nos permiten acciones preventivas en manejo forestal y los planes de manejo contemplan normas prevención de incendios forestales, y los drones nos permiten hacer fiscalización a estos programas, llámense cortafuegos, cortacombustible y otras medidas que estén contempladas. Además nos podemos encontrar con quemas ilegales, que van a ser registrados en tiempo real”, dijo Henríquez.

A su vez, el director regional (s) de CONAF, Mauricio Castel, manifestó que “esta tecnología nos permite realizar un trabajo de alto espectro y mayor dispersión en la superficie, que entre las cuatro regiones, suman casi 5 millones de hectáreas de bosque nativo, y se producen la mayor cantidad de talas ilegales e infracciones a la legislación vigente, se nos imposibilita de llegar a esos rincones”.

Por último, Marcelo Mahnke, ingeniero forestal y consultor comentó que “este es un gran aporte para todos quienes trabajamos en el sistema forestal, porque nos permite actualizarnos en nuestro modelo de control de faenas. Antes realizábamos vuelos particulares para ir viendo los avances en tareas forestales o mediciones en terreno con GPS y ahora, con el drone, nos permite agilizar los tiempos y en la calidad del trabajo que se puede entregar”, explicó Marcelo Mahnke, ingeniero forestal y consultor.",269,"Spanish"

2374004,"El Programa Mundial de Alimentos saluda que el acuerdo nacional priorice el tema del hambre y la malnutrición *LIMA –El Programa Mundial de Alimentos de Naciones Unidas (PMA) felicitó la decisión de los miembros del Acuerdo Nacional de priorizar la erradicación del hambre, la desnutrición crónica infantil (DCI) y la anemia, como un tema de interés nacional.*

El PMA considera que el gobierno peruano ha asumido una posición de liderazgo que incidirá en alinear al Estado y a la sociedad civil para alcanzar el segundo Objetivo de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS2), que es erradicar el hambre al año 2030.

Como se sabe, esta mañana los miembros del Acuerdo Nacional se reunieron con el fin de discutir las prioridades de las políticas públicas necesarias para acabar con el hambre, la desnutrición y la anemia en el Perú.

El Acuerdo Nacional es el espacio tripartido más importante de diálogo y consenso, en el que participan los tres niveles de gobierno (central, regional y local), los partidos políticos y la sociedad civil, para hacer un seguimiento concertado de las políticas de Estado.

En la reunión, la ministra de Inclusión y Desarrollo Social, Fiorella Molinelli, expuso acerca de los avances y las estrategias para enfrentar los problemas de la desnutrición crónica, la anemia y la extrema pobreza en el marco de los compromisos asumidos por el gobierno. La Primera Ministra, Mercedes Araoz sostuvo que: “El Perú se merece tener cero desnutrición y cero anemia. Es decir tener Hambre Cero”.

La representante del PMA en el Perú, Carmen Burbano de Lara, explicó los aspectos más relevantes del ODS2, y difundió información comparativa de los países de la región en la agenda 2030.
De las exposiciones y el debate de los asistentes se recogen los siguientes mensajes clave:

- El compromiso político al más alto nivel para la lucha contra el hambre, y la malnutrición es muy valorado e importante.

- Se debe impulsar un abordaje multisectorial e integral de la atención a la niñez que involucre a los tres sectores del gobierno, y tenga en cuenta la importancia de luchar paralelamente frente a la violencia contra la mujer.

- El compromiso de todos los partidos políticos, la comunidad internacional, y la sociedad civil es evidente y necesario para poder avanzar.

- Es importante hacer un seguimiento continuo al avance de las metas que el país se ha propuesto.
Carmen Burbano de Lara, representante del PMA en el Perú, indicó que la reunión en el Acuerdo Nacional evidencia la importancia que el Gobierno, los partidos y la sociedad le dan a la lucha contra la anemia y la desnutrición, como factor clave en el desarrollo del país, el crecimiento económico y en la inclusión social. Y recalcó que la comunidad internacional está comprometida a apoyar este esfuerzo.
“Que se discuta la problemática del hambre en el Acuerdo Nacional evidencia que Perú está comprometido a llegar al 2030 sin malnutrición. Para ello, es necesaria la presencia del sector privado, la sociedad civil y la academia que sumen esfuerzos que permitan acabar con la anemia y la desnutrición, dos problemas de salud pública que determinarán el desarrollo del país”, finalizó Burbano de Lara.

El PMA saluda el esfuerzo del gobierno peruano para hacer realidad el ODS2-Hambre Cero, su compromiso con la Agenda 2030, y considera que el Perú es un ejemplo mundial en estos grandes objetivos de política social, dado que logró reducir la Desnutrición Crónica Infantil en 50% (del 26% al 13%) en los últimos 10 años y con ello evidenció que la suma de esfuerzos por los diversos sectores puede acabar con la malnutrición, factor clave para el desarrollo del ser humano y para que el país pueda contar con programas de educación y de salud que sean exitosos.

Sin embargo, aún el 13% de los niñas y niñas menores de 5 años son afectados por la desnutrición crónica y existe una brecha muy grande dado que el mayor índice de prevalencia corresponde a comunidades indígenas de la amazonia peruana, donde más del 40% de niñas y niños son afectados por esta enfermedad.

A su vez, Perú aún tiene pendiente reducir los altos niveles de anemia, que afecta a aproximadamente 620.000 niños y niñas menores de 3 años, lo que perjudica su capacidad intelectual y de aprendizaje, y tiene un impacto en el desarrollo del país.
Otro problema que afecta a la población peruana es la presencia del sobrepeso y obesidad, dado que ambos muestran una tendencia acelerada hacia el incremento. Las mayores prevalencias se dan en los niños en edad escolar que habitan en medios urbanos (41%).

2373994,"Plantean declarar alerta naranja en Beni por lluvias Trinidad, 13 dic (ABI).- El director departamental del Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia (COE), Cristhian Cámara, informó el miércoles que esa instancia elabora un informe para proponer al gobernador, Alex Ferrier, la declaratoria de alerta naranja a causa de las fuertes lluvias y aumento en el nivel de los ríos registrados en el departamento del Beni.

""Debido a las ocurrencias que hemos tenido principalmente en las provincias Marbán, Cercado, Yacuma y Ballivián, estamos preparando un informe para elevar a consideración del Gobernador la declaratoria de alerta naranja en todo el Beni"", dijo a los periodistas.

Explicó que esa declaratoria significa que el Gobierno departamental debe estar preparado para un evento que se prevé pueda suceder, considerando la temporada lluviosa que cada año ocasiona inundaciones en ese departamento.

Informó que de los 19 municipios del Beni solamente dos enviaron sus planes de contingencia para enfrentar las inundaciones.

Recomendó al sector privado, como los ganaderos, tomar sus previsiones para minimizar los daños si se produce una inundación de grandes proporciones.

**SAN JOSÉ DEL GUAVIARE**

La Unidad para la Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas, en el marco de la estrategia “Convivencia y paz” entregó en el departamento del Guaviare 561 indemnizaciones administrativas a víctimas del conflicto, que superan los $2.000 millones.

Esta estrategia hacía parte del proyecto ‘Focalización de cupos de Indemnización en Zonas Estratégicas de Respuesta Rápida’ del Fondo Multidonante para el Posconflicto en Colombia de la ONU, en el marco de la implementación del Acuerdo de Paz de La Habana, en el capítulo de víctimas.

Los municipios priorizados en el Guaviare fueron la capital del departamento y El Retorno, en donde las familias seleccionadas, desarrollaron durante más de ocho meses sesiones de trabajo grupal en las líneas de recuperación emocional y educación financiera para que al finalizar las etapas del proceso, las víctimas hicieran buen uso de los recursos económicos que les entrega el Estado.

Ricardo Alarcón de 26 años fue uno de los beneficiarios. Vive en San José del Guaviare con su familia con quienes participó, expresando que: “fuimos desplazados en el año de 2012, tuvimos que abandonar el hogar y nuestras pertenencias. Pasamos de la niñez a la adolescencia con muchas dificultades económicas. Como a muchas víctimas del país, el desplazamiento tocó a la puerta haciéndose parte de nuestra vida. La estrategia, fue una oportunidad de reparación en el que decidimos involucrarnos porque era un programa familiar que buscaba sanar heridas a través del acompañamiento emocional que nos permitía interactuar con nuestros iguales: víctimas del conflicto armado. Finalizamos recibiendo la indemnización económica que servirá para emprender iniciativas productivas que nos permitan salir adelante, plantearnos nuevos metas y sueños”.

Los participantes en el ejercicio denominado en la estrategia como “Bitácora viajera”, plasmaron mensajes y ejercicios de memoria sobre los hechos que tuvieron que vivir enfatizando en cómo estos recuerdos podían ser sanados a través del perdón.

“La recuperación emocional se orientaba en resarcir el daño causado por el conflicto armado, reconstruir el tejido social a través de los encuentros grupales en los cuales trabajaban actividades que les permitían crear lazos y redes de apoyo entre ellos. En algunos casos era complejo hacerlos recordar el pasado ya que aún habitaban emociones de dolor y tristeza. Pero al final nos encontramos con que era posible sanar para seguir” expresó Angélica Sánchez, la coordinadora seccional de Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM). 

Javier Triana con su esposa Jacqueline Pérez, recuerdan todo lo que tuvieron que vivir para llegar al día de hoy: “Teníamos un negocio familiar en el que nos iba muy bien en Calamar, Guaviare. Nos amenazaron y nos tocó rebuscar como sostener nuestra familia. Pasamos muchas necesidades, nos toco irnos a vivir dificultades en Bogotá una ciudad tan grande que desconocíamos y en la cual sufrimos mucho. Con la estrategia recibimos apoyo de las profesionales psicosociales, nos dimos cuenta que aún guardábamos secuelas emocionales del conflicto armado y en compañía de otras víctimas, empezamos a perdonar a quienes nos hicieron daño y a nosotros mismos ya que algunos nos sentíamos culpables. De las cosas que más valoramos de este proceso es haber podido conocer las historias de otros sobrevivientes de la guerra, con ellos nos preparamos para ser actores de paz en nuestro municipio”.

El director territorial para Meta y Llanos orientales, Carlos Pardo Alezones, afirmó que estas acciones tenían un alcance social de alto impacto, con más de 500 familias que fueron alcanzadas y reparadas administrativamente en uno de los departamentos del sur del país con mayor número de víctimas del conflicto armado con 34.917 personas, según el Registro Único de Víctimas.

Los eventos en los municipios culminaron con la realización de Ferias de servicios que contaban con la oferta institucional de entidades como el Banco Agrario, las Agencias de Empleo del sistema público, el Fondo Nacional del Ahorro y los gobiernos locales con los proyectos en vivienda y educación, que impulsan en cada territorio.",269,"Spanish"

Alentó a ambos países a aceptar la asesoría y ayuda ofrecidas por las agencias de Naciones Unidas.

De Zayas, que estuvo en los países suramericanos del 26 de noviembre al 9 de diciembre, es el primer experto independiente* de la ONU sobre la promoción de un orden internacional democrático y equitativo. También es el primer relator y experto en derechos humanos en visitar Venezuela desde 1996.

“El propósito de la misión no es condenar a los gobiernos, es ayudar al pueblo venezolano a llegar a un diálogo, a llegar a un acuerdo mutuo para que la democracia en Venezuela funcione mejor”, dijo de Zayas este miércoles en una entrevista con Noticias ONU.

“El progreso en el sector social en Venezuela y Ecuador, compatible con el pacto relativo a los derechos económicos, sociales y culturales, debe conocerse y ser reconocido de forma más general”, declaró el martes en una reunión con la prensa de Zayas, cuya misión se enfocó en examinar las iniciativas para promover el progreso social y la mejora de los estándares de vida.

El experto subrayó los esfuerzos realizados en ambos países en los ámbitos de la educación, la asistencia médica, la vivienda, la creación de empleos y la lucha contra la discriminación.

Asimismo, afirmó que factores externos tales como la fuga de capitales a paraísos fiscales, medidas coercitivas unilaterales y contrabando de alimentos y medicinas, así como factores internos constituyen “graves obstáculos” al respecto de los derechos humanos.

“También estoy consciente de los problemas endémicos que persisten o han empeorado en la región, incluyendo pobreza, corrupción, escasez de ciertos alimentos y medicinas, fallas en garantizar el consentimiento libre, previo e informado en el sector extractivo, inflación, distribución ineficiente, insuficiente separación de poderes, irregularidades electorales y represión del disenso”, aseveró.

“El progreso social va de la mano con los derechos civiles y políticos y no debe lograrse a expensas de las libertades civiles”, afirmó el experto, quien dijo que pidió la liberación de más de 20 personas actualmente detenidas.

“Lo más importante es asegurar que la paz social se mantenga a fin de promover el diálogo entre todos los sectores de la población, acercarse al sector privado y escuchar sus propuestas”, insistió.

Asimismo, de Zayas pidió solidaridad internacional incluyendo con el apoyo de organizaciones internacionales.

“Los países no deben ser aislados ni boicoteados”, afirmó. “Solicité a Venezuela buscar servicios de asesoría y asistencia técnica de las Naciones Unidas y, al parecer, este llamamiento ha sido escuchado”.

De Zayas indicó que tanto Venezuela como Ecuador están haciendo un esfuerzo “considerable” para lograr los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible antes de la fecha límite de 2030, dedicando un porcentaje importante de los presupuestos nacionales a los servicios sociales.

La licenciada Silvia del Águila reforzó con los delegados, temas de liderazgo y coordinación efectiva, así como la importancia del trabajo conjunto con las instituciones que ejecutan las acciones que forman parte de la Estrategia Nacional para la Prevención de la Desnutrición Crónica.

El secretario González compartió con el personal departamental, sobre las actividades de fortalecimiento que se llevaron a cabo durante el presente año, para garantizar que los procesos de coordinación y articulación se realicen de manera adecuada y efectiva.

A través de una presentación, González recordó a los delegados que la fuente primaria para la toma de decisiones en lo que respecta seguridad alimentaria y nutricional es la información oficial.

La SESAN en su rol coordinador y articulador, utiliza información oficial para identificar problemas de seguridad alimentaria y nutricional, determinar la solución, implementar la política pública y llevar a cabo el monitoreo y evaluación para su posterior retroalimentación, la cual obtiene de la Encuesta Nacional Materno Infantil –ENSMI- 2014-2015 y del Cuarto Censo Nacional de talla en Escolares.

La ENSMI 2014-2015 tiene representatividad a nivel nacional y departamental e incluye un capítulo sobre prevalencia de desnutrición crónica en menores de dos años a nivel departamental, lo que permite analizar mucho mejor la importancia de la ventana de los mil días.

El Cuarto Censo nacional de talla en Escolares, se llevó a cabo con 385,635 niños del primer grado de educación primaria del sector público, comprendidos en las edades de seis a nueve años con once meses. Dicho censo tiene una representatividad nacional, departamental, municipal y en toda comunidad en la que haya una escuela primaria.

Con la información de estas dos fuentes oficiales se llevan a cabo comparativos que son publicados en el Sistema Nacional de Información de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional –SINSAN-, administrado por la SESAN, el cual es uso público.

Según González, gracias a la información generada en la ENSMI y el Cuarto Censo Nacional de Talla, se evidenció la problemática del sobrepeso y obesidad, desde muy temprana edad, por lo que la SESAN está trabajando en la incorporación de la misma en las agendas del 2018. “La desnutrición crónica está íntimamente relacionada con el sobrepeso y la obesidad, por lo que si reducimos la desnutrición crónica, disminuimos un sesenta por ciento de los problemas de obesidad y sobrepeso”, indicó el secretario González.

Finalmente instruyó a los delegados a compartir esta información y sus fuentes en todos los comités departamentales y municipales de seguridad alimentaria y nutricional, para sensibilizar a las autoridades locales e incidir en la política pública.",269,"Spanish"

El trabajo de la Coalición se enfocará inicialmente en una acción coordinada en cuatro prioridades fundamentales: escalar la energía renovable y la eficiencia energética; construir infraestructura baja en carbono y resiliente al clima; crear modelos de financiamiento innovadores a cambio de avances en la reforma de políticas para promover el crecimiento climáticamente inteligente; y fortalecer la capacidad de los países del Caribe para planificar estrategias de resiliencia al clima a largo plazo. El [anuncio](http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=EZSHARE-1748706463-9) de la creación de la Coalición se dio durante el One Planet Summit, convocado por el gobierno de Francia para revisar el progreso del Acuerdo de París sobre cambio climático, el cual fue adoptado hoy hace dos años.

A raíz de los devastadores impactos de los huracanes Irma y María, ambos categoría cinco, la vulnerabilidad del Caribe a los efectos del cambio climático se ha vuelto más evidente. El [BID estima](http://www.iadb.org/en/office-of-evaluation-and-oversight/climate-change-in-the-caribbean-small-island-states,18283.html?isajaxrequest&actionuserstats=close&valcookie=) que el impacto económico de los efectos climáticos de la “nueva normalidad” bajo un escenario en el que nada cambia podrían sobrepasar los US$22 mil millones por año para el 2050, aproximadamente el 10 por ciento del PIB actual del Caribe. Como respuesta, el Grupo BID busca desarrollar un marco de inversión pública y privada para invertir en infraestructura resiliente, proporcionando recursos contingentes para responder a desastres, y aprobando financiamiento adicional de préstamos para respaldar el marco de políticas de la región para enfrentar el riesgo de desastres naturales y climáticos. El Grupo BID trabajará con el Banco de Desarrollo del Caribe para apoyar a países miembros prestatarios de la OECS.

El apoyo del Grupo BID incluirá nuevos compromisos financieros de los sectores público y privado de mil millones en los próximos cinco años. Junto con el anuncio de las metas de préstamos, el Grupo BID también lanzó la nueva [Plataforma de Islas Sostenibles](https://vimeo.com/246173791), diseñada para ayudar a territorios insulares a buscar inversiones sostenibles y resilientes al clima. La Plataforma beneficiará a 11 estados insulares de la Cuenca del Caribe y países continentales cuyo territorio incluye islas: Bahamas, Barbados, Belice, Costa Rica, República Dominicana, Haití, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panamá, Trinidad y Tobago. La Plataforma promoverá el crecimiento económico y las inversiones resilientes al clima a través de un enfoque innovador que pone en práctica los principios de la Economía Azul y la Economía Circular. La Economía Azul se enfoca en la sostenibilidad de la actividad económica en zonas marítimas y costeras, mientras que la Economía Circular hace énfasis en la reutilización, el reciclaje y la regeneración de los recursos naturales, tales como los manglares y las barreras de coral en un contexto marítimo; y promueve la energía renovable, mayor eficiencia de energía y agua, y un manejo integrado de residuos y recursos en tierra.

El apoyo a las actividades del sector privado asociadas con la Coalición será coordinado por BID Invest, el brazo del sector privado del Grupo BID, e incluirá alianzas con inversionistas de impacto, fuentes bilaterales y otras instituciones multilaterales con relación a soluciones de financiamiento con recursos concesionales, así como el desarrollo de nuevos instrumentos.

Ante las condiciones meteorológicas durante la época de frío, se recomienda a la población tomar precauciones debido a que los bancos de niebla y neblina podrían reducir la visibilidad e influir en el tránsito de vehículos, usar adecuadamente las luces del automóvil y respetar los señalamientos de tránsito en las zonas donde se presenten estos fenómenos, y se le exhorta a vestir ropa abrigadora y brindar especial atención a niños, personas de la tercera edad y enfermos.

Por otra parte, un vórtice de núcleo frío que se localiza en el noroeste de la República Mexicana, en combinación con vientos máximos en altura, generarán lluvias con intervalos de chubascos en regiones de Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Durango, Veracruz, Tabasco y Oaxaca, y lluvias dispersas en Chihuahua, Zacatecas, Nayarit, Jalisco, Chiapas, Campeche y Quintana Roo.

En el Istmo y el Golfo de Tehuantepec se prevé viento del norte con rachas superiores a 60 kilómetros por hora (km/h).",269,"Spanish"
2373574,"Mindefensa anuncia creación del ‘Plan Orus’, fase avanzada del plan Victoria para consolidar la paz *Caucasia, Antioquia. 11 de diciembre de 2017*

*Este lunes desde la Audiencia Pública de Rendición de Cuentas del Sector Defensa que se realizó en esa zona del Bajo Cauca, el ministro de Defensa, Luis Carlos Villegas, reveló que hace unas horas junto con el presidente Juan Manuel Santos y la cúpula de las Fuerzas, se ajustó minuciosamente el plan ‘Victoria’ y Comunidades Seguras y en Paz –de Fuerzas Militares y de Policía, respectivamente– para crear ‘Plan Orus’, una fase avanzada de esas estrategias con las que se ha llegado a las regiones dejadas por las Farc gracias al Acuerdo de Paz.*

“63 mil uniformados estarán presentes en 67 municipios y 595 veredas, ellos estarán focalizados en esas áreas para aplicar este plan Orus. En cada vereda habrá un pelotón o compañía de Fuerza Pública para que tengan un tutor que responda por esa comunidad, para que sepa en dónde están los líderes que pueden ser amenazados, quiénes están en alto riesgo, en dónde hay cultivos ilícitos, cuáles son las debilidades de infraestructura y otras situaciones. Se denominó plan ‘Orus’ porque que así se llamaba un dios mitológico que lo veía todo, y eso es lo que queremos: desplegar más Fuerza Pública para ver los movimientos de cada región y que la gente también los vea mucho más”, reveló Villegas.

Ante centenares de habitantes de Caucasia, el ministro de Defensa afirmó que estos planes de la Fuerza Pública son un logro enorme de las Fuerzas Armadas pero debían ser ajustados para robustecer algunos mecanismos.

Por su parte el Comandante General de las Fuerzas Militares, general Alberto Mejía, aseguró: “Aquí está es la mayor integración de labores y misiones de las Fuerzas Militares y de Policía. Habrá apoyo en misiones de inteligencia, investigación, vigilancia y otras tareas”.

Por otra parte, el Ministro de Defensa se refirió a los registros históricos de la tasa de homicidio en Colombia que alcanzó los 23 casos por cada 100 mil habitantes. “El homicidio en el país cayó un 10 por ciento comparado con el año 2016, es decir, salvamos más de 600 vidas. Esos registros mundialmente sirven para medir cómo está una sociedad; hace 17 años la tasa de muertes violentas era de 60 por cien mil habitantes”.

Informó que los casos de secuestro, extorsión, piratería, acciones subversivas y otro tipo de delitos también cayeron en los últimos meses. Además informó que gracias a los Acuerdos de Paz el registro de muertes en la Fuerza Pública disminuyó notablemente en los últimos meses.

“Las estructuras y amenazas que quedaron después de la firma del Acuerdo de Paz y el final del conflicto las estamos atacando con toda la vehemencia y toda la contundencia –sostuvo–. El Eln está en un cese al fuego imperfecto y temporal que esperemos pueda ser renovado en enero, y que se haga con elementos nuevos y con cese de hostilidades contra civiles, porque ellos no pueden seguir asesinando líderes indígenas, secuestrando campesinos, y seguir en esa actitud de que el cese es sólo con la Fuerza Pública e irrespetando a la población civil”.

El Ministro Villegas indicó que en lo corrido de 2017 el ‘clan del Golfo’ se quedó sin dos de sus más importantes cabecillas, ‘Gavilán’ e ‘Inglaterra’, hace tres días perdieron a alias ‘Tom’ –uno de sus más temibles jefes urbanos–, se les han incautado unas 100 toneladas de cocaína, armamento, y tienen una tercera parte de los hombres en armas que tenían hace seis años.

En Caucasia, según Villegas, se han presentado los logros más importantes de todo el país materia de lucha contra el narcotráfico y grupos de crimen organizado.

“La paz se arraigará en Colombia gracias al papel de nuestra Fuerza Pública”, concluyó Villegas.",269,"Spanish"

(MADS).** A través de un Memorando de Entendimiento el Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible y la Universidad de Córdoba trabajarán por la implementación del Plan Paz Córdoba, que tiene componentes ambientales y sociales. “Lo que quiero ratificar es el compromiso del Gobierno Nacional y de este Ministerio para sacar adelante este proyecto que realmente beneficia a las comunidades en el marco de la construcción de un nuevo país, de la consolidación de la paz en este departamento. Hoy estamos dando un paso muy importante en materia de cooperación, sobre todo enfocado a la conservación de la naturaleza y preservación de nuestros recursos naturales en el marco de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible”, dijo el ministro de Ambiente, Luis Gilberto Murillo.

La Universidad de Córdoba construyó el Plan Paz Córdoba para tener y gestionar de una manera consensuada un plan regional que permita la implementación del Acuerdo de Paz. “Este Plan demuestra que sí es viable la implementación de elementos del Acuerdo de Paz que nos lleven a construir situaciones de paz estable y duradera, eso implica desarrollo y sostenibilidad, y un equilibrio entre la conservación de nuestros activos naturales y las necesidades de desarrollo social y económico”, enfatizó el Ministro Murillo.

Este Plan tiene cuatro componentes fundamentales: atención a la primera infancia, construcción territorial de paz, sustitución de cultivos y alfabetización.

“Esta firma es el reconocimiento del esfuerzo institucional a este iniciativa de paz que hace un año y medio inició. Lo que sigue son los apoyos del gobierno para empezar a ejecutar cada una de las iniciativas.

Va a ser fundamental la pedagogía ambiental y la reconstrucción del tejido social”, afirmó Jairo Torres, rector de la Universidad de Córdoba.

También se trabajará en conjunto para diseñar e implementar un programa de alto nivel a nivel de maestrías que permita avanzar en la formación de nuevos líderes para la región. Además, habrá un coordinador de la alianza para que este Memorando de Entendimiento se implemente desde este momento y por cinco años prorrogables. “Es muy importante que la universidad haya construido el Plan Paz Córdoba, pues este departamento es prioridad en la agenda de Ambiente y Paz y en la adaptación y mitigación de los efectos del cambio climático”, puntualizó Murillo Urrutia.",269,"Spanish"
2373484,"Especialistas de CCSS piden proteger a los adultos mayores de bajas temperaturas Antes las bajas temperaturas registradas en el país en los últimos días, especialistas de la Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS), lanzaron un llamado a la población para que arropen a los adultos mayores y no los expongan al frío.

El doctor Fernando Morales Martínez, director del Hospital Nacional de Geriatría y Gerontología, explicó que esta situación meteorológica exacerba las infecciones respiratorias, las cuales posteriormente pueden complicarse con  cuadros de bronconeumonía y neumonía.

El médico dijo que lo mejor es que mientras persistan las bajas temperatura, los adultos mayores no salgan de sus casas y si no lo hacen que lo hagan muy bien abrigados.

El director del Hospital Geriátrico recordó que en esta época suele aumentar la circulación de los virus respiratorios y por ellos se deben tomar un conjunto de medidas para reducir el impacto de estos agentes virales en toda la población, pero en especial de aquellas personas mayores de 65 años.

El médico destacó que ya se está observando un incremento de casos en el hospital que dirige y por lo tanto lo conveniente es cuidarse.

Paralelamente, solicitó que los mantengan hidratados y que no se olviden de la administración de los medicamentos  que siempre consumen y de la adecuada nutrición.

Una advertencia similar efectuaron recientemente la doctora María Eugenia Villalta Bonilla, gerente médica de la institución y la doctora Xiomara Badilla Vargas, directora de Vigilancia Epidemiológica de la CCSS quienes añadieron otras recomendaciones tales como:

Lavado de manos constante.

La aplicación del protocolo de estornudar y toser, es decir taparse la nariz y la boca con un pañuelo, preferiblemente desechable o en su defecto con el antebrazo.

No asistir a lugares donde haya personas enfermas.

Si están enfermos no asistir a sitios donde haya grandes aglomeraciones.

La doctora Xiomara Badilla Vargas dijo que si bien en este momento, el número de casos está dentro de lo esperado, es necesario tomar medidas para evitar un repunte que pueda provocar complicaciones indeseables.

La especialistas en epidemiología dijo que están efectuando un monitoreo constante de la circulación de estos virus para ir determinando las intervenciones que se deben ir haciendo en las zonas donde se observe un mayor incremento.",269,"Spanish"

Flash Update No. 1: Desplazamiento masivo y restricciones a la movilidad en el municipio de Suárez (Cauca)

Entre el 7 y 8 de diciembre se presentaron fuertes enfrentamientos entre dos grupos armados no identificados en el corregimiento de Los Robles, zona rural del municipio de Suárez. Estas acciones armadas desencadenaron el desplazamiento masivo de al menos 166 familias (473 personas) pertenencientes a las veredas La Cabaña, Agua Bonita, Unión Olivare, Los Robles y La Fonda Damián, quienes se albergaron en diferentes Sitios de Asamblea Permanente (SAP) como medida de autoprotección, en diferentes lugares de las veredas afectadas (Ver tabla). A la fecha de publicación de éste informe estas personas presentan restricciones a la movilidad ante la presencia de grupos armados en la zona. En el enfrentamiento murieron seis personas3 . 

El 9 de diciembre se realizó una misión interinstitucional de verificación4 identificando necesidades en los sectores de albergue, seguridad alimentaria, agua, saneamiento básico y atención psicosocial, éste último por el impacto emocional evidenciado en las familias desplazadas, principalmente en mujeres y niños, niñás y adolescentes (NNA). 

El 10 de diciembre, la Alcaldía de Suárez convocó a un Comité Municipal de Justicia Transicional (CMJT) manifestando que se entregará Ayuda Humantiaria Inmediata entre el 11 y 17 de diciembre; esta entrega será asumida por el ente municipal y departamental mientras se tramita la solicitud ante la UARIV para complementariedad de la respuesta. A partir del 18 de diciembre. La Defensoría del Pueblo enviará el responsable en temas de género con el fin de abordar las afectaciones psicosociales en mujeres y NNA.

Aunque se presentaron cifras preliminares de las personas afectadas, el CMJT aún no se cuenta con el censo oficial para cada uno de los hechos victimizantes. Desde el 11 de diciembre la Personería inició el proceso de toma de declaraciones y levantamiento de censo; al cierre de este informe dicho proceso no ha sido finalizado.

La Comisión Permanente de Contingencias (Copeco) celebró su 27 aniversario como mejor lo sabe hacer: trabajando por la reducción del riesgo de desastres en Honduras. 

La jornada que dejó a un lado los globos, la música y el festejo, se enfocó en realizar a nivel nacional trabajos de dragado, limpieza de alcantarillado y destrucción de residuos de madera en las zonas afectadas por la caída de árboles durante el paso del reciente frente frío. 

Las acciones comenzaron a las 7:00 de la mañana en la colonia 1 de Diciembre de Comayagüela donde maquinaria y personal de Copeco limpió y dragó cuatro kilómetros del cauce de la quebrada La Soledad para evitar futuras inundaciones por lluvias.

La quebrada cruza las colonias Gracias a Dios, 1 de Diciembre, Iberia y Centro América, entre otras que son parte de uno de los  sectores de la ciudad gemela, y que han sido más golpeados por las crecidas que generan las lluvias.

El Comisionado Nacional de Copeco, Lisando Rosales, señaló que el trabajo de la institución es permanente especialmente el dragado y limpieza de cauces de río y quebradas a nivel nacional, labores que se realizan antes y después de la temporada lluviosa. 

“Es una acción de prevención que venimos realizando por parte de Copeco y qué mejor que hacerlo siempre que podamos  y celebrar  con esta acción el aniversario de la institución”, puntualizó Rosales al detallar que este año se ha hecho el dragado de más de 55 kilómetros de cauce de ríos y quebradas solo en el Distrito Central.

Rosales explicó también que en el caso de la colonia 1 de Diciembre la acción fue parte del complemento de un proyecto que se realiza en la zona para la construcción de un pequeño parque de recreación que el Gobierno de la República edificará en este sector y que ayudará a la recreación de la población de esa colonia.",269,"Spanish"

2371869,"Los grupos armados de Colombia y su disputa por el botín de la paz - Informe sobre América Latina N°63 **Resumen ejecutivo**

El proceso de paz con el mayor y más antiguo grupo guerrillero de Colombia ha desafiado a sus detractores y ha llevado a 11.200 excombatientes a las puertas de la vida civil, pero el periodo posterior a la guerra no le ha ofrecido seguridad a todos. Desde que las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) se retiraron de sus núcleos rurales para agruparse en campamentos a principios de 2017, actores armados rivales han ocupado su lugar, librando una batalla por los despojos: el control de comunidades y territorios aislados, muchos de ellos ricos en negocios ilícitos. En Tumaco, centro de distribución de cocaína del Pacífico, en las aldeas de Chocó, o en zonas de contrabando en la frontera con Venezuela, grupos armados establecidos y nuevas facciones disidentes han atacado a las fuerzas estatales, intimidando a comunidades y pujando por convertirse en los indiscutibles caciques locales. La seguridad a nivel local es fundamental para asegurar el éxito del proceso de paz con las FARC a medida que se pasa de la entrega de armas supervisada por la ONU a reformas estructurales políticas y sociales más profundas. Los esfuerzos para combatir a los restantes grupos armados son fundamentales, pero el gobierno no debe alienar a la población y exacerbar la pobreza de tal forma que se agraven las condiciones que impulsan el crecimiento de estos grupos.

La mayoría de estas facciones armadas ahora se agrupan en torno a zonas costeras y fronterizas. Alrededor de 1.000 disidentes de las FARC, que rechazan el acuerdo de paz por varios motivos, gobiernan de facto diversos territorios, varios de los cuales dependen del narcotráfico. La segunda mayor fuerza guerrillera de Colombia, el Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), ha negociado un cese al fuego temporal con el gobierno, a pesar de estar contemplando la conquista de nuevos territorios, en especial a lo largo de la costa pacífica. Las Autodefensas Gaitanistas, actualmente el mayor grupo neoparamilitar del país, combinan una jerarquía militar vertical centrada en el noroeste del país con una red de bandas locales subcontratadas. Actualmente es la principal organización narcotraficante del país.

Los prósperos negocios ilícitos – pujantes plantaciones de coca, minas de oro ilegales, redes de extorsión y contrabando – son responsables de la supervivencia y expansión de muchos de estos grupos. Pero los intereses económicos por sí solos no explican el apoyo que reciben dentro de algunas comunidades. Mediante la resolución de disputas y la defensa de los medios de vida ilícitos frente a las fuerzas de seguridad, estos grupos han establecido una forma rudimentaria y autoritaria de liderazgo político local. El Estado colombiano ha respondido mediante el “Plan Victoria”, de alcance nacional, desplegando 80.000 soldados y agentes policiales para que ocupen el territorio que han desalojado las FARC. Sin embargo, aún si las fuerzas de seguridad pudieran tomar todo el territorio en disputa, la coerción por sí sola no puede establecer vínculos de confianza entre el Estado y los ciudadanos locales; por el contrario, se debe persuadir a estos de que existe una alternativa mejor que la justicia sumaria y la disciplina social impuestas por los grupos ilegales.

La siguiente fase de reformas bajo el acuerdo de paz pretende precisamente construir esa confianza entre el Estado y la ciudadanía. Incluye un sistema democrático más plural, la reintegración de excombatientes de las FARC, justicia para las víctimas del conflicto, y un programa de sustitución de cultivos de coca. Pero su implementación se enfrenta a numerosas dificultades. Los programas de reintegración integral se encuentran en suspenso. La sustitución voluntaria de los cultivos de coca, uno de los programas emblemáticos del acuerdo, requerirá un compromiso a largo plazo por parte del Estado y mucho mayor apoyo político y financiero internacional. La corrupción debilita la campaña del gobierno contra los grupos armados, y se debe contrarrestar mediante organismos más fuertes e independientes que operen dentro y fuera de las fuerzas militares y la policía. Además, se debe considerar urgentemente el diseño de nuevos enfoques judiciales que puedan alentar a otros grupos armados a dejar las armas y seguir el camino de las FARC hacia la paz.

La derrota del acuerdo inicial en un plebiscito realizado en 2016 demostró la desconfianza del público en el proceso de paz, planteando el riesgo de que las elecciones de 2018 lleven al poder a un gobierno decidido a reescribir o vaciar de contenido el acuerdo. La implementación del acuerdo se encuentra amenazada tanto por una oposición que piensa que le hizo el juego a la guerrilla de las FARC, como por facciones armadas que ven el acuerdo o bien como un fraude o como una oportunidad de expandirse. La combinación de una actividad armada local con una política nacional divisoria podría debilitar decisivamente el apoyo público hacia el acuerdo, a menos que los resultados del proceso de paz vuelvan a desafiar las expectativas. Para que esto suceda, el gobierno debe contrarrestar tanto a la inseguridad local como a las debilidades más amplias de la gobernabilidad local que la sustentan.**",269,"Spanish"

2371839,"Alto Comisionado afirma que el Pacto Mundial representa una oportunidad para trazar un nuevo rumbo *En la apertura de una reunión clave en Ginebra, Filippo Grandi dijo que la misión de la Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados es ahora más urgente que nunca.*

GINEBRA, Suiza, 12 de diciembre de 2017 (ACNUR) – Un años después del compromiso mundial de trabajar en conjunto para mejorar la respuesta a las situaciones de las personas refugiadas, la tragedia del desplazamiento forzado continúa profundizándose, declaró hoy el Alto Comisionado de la ONU para los Refugiados.

En la apertura de una reunión clave en Ginebra sobre el nuevo Pacto Mundial sobre Refugiados, Filippo Grandi recalcó que en todo el mundo las personas continúan huyendo de sus hogares, víctimas de una falla colectiva de la comunidad internacional para prevenir y resolver conflictos.

“Nuestra misión es ahora más urgente que nunca…El éxodo de Myanmar a Bangladesh es el más visible, sin embargo, civiles inocentes continúan huyendo para salvar sus vidas en RCA, RDC, Irak, Sudán del Sur, Siria y otros lugares”, dijo el Alto Comisionado de la ONU para los Refugiados.

Grandi dio un discurso en la apertura del décimo Diálogo del Alto Comisionado sobre los Desafíos de Protección, que se lleva a cabo el 12 y 13 de diciembre.

La reunión principalmente hará balance de los resultados de las consultas que se han llevado a cabo desde que 193 Estados Miembro de las Naciones Unidas adoptaron, en 2016, la Declaración de Nueva York, en compromiso con la responsabilidad de los miembros de compartir las responsabilidades con los refugiados del mundo, así como para apoyar a las comunidades de acogida. Esto incluye el Marco de Respuesta Integral para los Refugiados (CRRF, por sus siglas en inglés).

“La atención mundial sobre los refugiados puede aumentar y disminuir en medio de los caprichos de la política internacional, pero la Declaración de Nueva York continúa siendo un compromiso político de alto nivel para cambiar la forma en la que le damos respuesta a las crisis de refugiados”, dijo a los delegados de la reunión en el Palacio de las Naciones.

“El Pacto Mundial sobre Refugiados es nuestra oportunidad de trazar un rumbo diferente”.
“El Pacto Mundial debería ser un instrumento para tomar ese compromiso y ponerlo en acción, con el fin de que las personas refugiadas tengan una oportunidad de reconstruir vidas productivas y llenas de sentido, y contribuyan con la comunidad que los acoge y con su propio futuro”, añadió.

Grandi solicitó que el pacto cambie la forma en que la comunidad internacional se relaciona con los refugiados,  y sostuvo que el fracaso de la cooperación internacional también había socavado la protección de aquellos que huyen del conflicto y la persecución en forma de cierres fronterizos, acceso restringido y politización de los movimientos de refugiados.

“Los refugiados pagan el precio (de esto), al igual que el grupo de países que cargan la parte más pesada de recibir refugiados sin el apoyo confiable de otros países que cuentan con más medios”, dijo, y agregó: “En un momento en que el multilateralismo flaquea en otras esferas, el Pacto Mundial sobre Refugiados es nuestra oportunidad de trazar un rumbo diferente a través del compromiso práctico y la cooperación basados en los valores humanitarios”.

Grandi describió la Declaración de Nueva York como un hito que otorga a las situaciones de refugiados una gran visibilidad política y compromiso, así como una importante reafirmación de los valores humanitarios fundamentales.

“Los refugiados pagan el precio, al igual que el grupo de países que cargan la parte más pesada”.
Elogió a los 13 países que ya iniciaron el lanzamiento del CRRF, y a aquellos que han participado en la revisión de lecciones aprendidas hasta la fecha, junto con experiencias de otras situaciones de refugiados a gran escala. También acogió con satisfacción los resultados de las recientes conferencias de compromisos de contribuciones.

Él calificó las cinco discusiones temáticas, celebradas entre julio y noviembre de 2017, como “positivas, progresistas y llenas de ideas”.

Se espera que unos 500 representantes de gobiernos, autoridades locales, sociedad civil, sector privado, académicos, organizaciones internacionales e instituciones financieras, así como delegados de la juventud refugiada de todo el mundo, asistan a las reuniones de la próxima semana.

Uganda fue el primer país que decidió aplicar el CRRF una vez que se adoptó la Declaración de Nueva York. Dirigiéndose al foro en Ginebra, el Representante Permanente Adjunto Benedict Lawrence Lukwiya destacó cómo su política de refugiados “ha logrado soportar la presión de una afluencia continua” de más de 1 millón de refugiados.

Esto se debe a que el gobierno reconoció lo suficientemente temprano la necesidad de ir más allá de la protección de los refugiados y la ayuda de emergencia, para comenzar a abordar las necesidades de desarrollo a más largo plazo. En segundo lugar, el gobierno también reconoció que la respuesta humanitaria también debe ser respaldada si queremos garantizar una entrega efectiva y resultados concretos en las áreas subsiguientes de nuestras responsabilidades de acogida de refugiados.

“El modelo de coordinación de refugiados de Uganda y el plan de respuesta a los refugiados se centraron en las soluciones desde el inicio de la afluencia, así como las intervenciones para salvar vidas y la protección del medio ambiente. El éxito en estas áreas está siendo respaldado por la política de apoyo a la prestación de servicios integrados para las comunidades de acogida y la inclusión de los refugiados en la planificación gubernamental”.

Lukwiya concluyó con un llamado a todos los donantes y partes involucradas para que cumplan con sus compromisos de comenzar a cumplir con los “objetivos de compartir la carga que nos hemos fijado en la Declaración de Nueva York. Y esto también debería incluir oportunidades de reasentamiento en terceros países para los refugiados en Uganda”.

El Pacto Mundial sobre Refugiados se basará en el marco internacional existente para la protección de las personas refugiadas, incluida la Convención de 1951 sobre el Estatuto de los Refugiados, y pretende compartir de manera más equitativa la responsabilidad de acoger a las personas refugiadas del mundo, así como ayudarles a reconstruir sus vidas.

Este propondrá los pasos concretos que deben tomar los gobiernos, así como otras partes involucradas, para garantizar que las comunidades que acogen a los refugiados reciban el apoyo oportuno que necesitan, que los refugiados estén mejor incluidos en las comunidades de acogida (con acceso a la salud, la educación y los medios de vida), y que se busquen soluciones al sufrimiento de las personas desde el comienzo de una situación de refugiados.

En febrero de 2018, ACNUR comenzará las consultas formales sobre el Pacto con los gobiernos y otras partes interesadas. El Alto Comisionado propondrá un Pacto a la Asamblea General de la ONU hacia finales de 2018.

En un comunicado, Guterres pide a los líderes políticos del país, en particular a los candidatos presidenciales, que “ejerzan su liderazgo con responsabilidad en un momento crucial para el futuro de Honduras.

Tras el recuento de los votos, las autoridades electorales dieron ventaja al presidente Juan Orlando Hernández, conservador, que busca la reelección. El aspirante de izquierdas Salvador Nasralla asegura que ha habido fraude electoral.

El Tribunal Supremo Electoral (TSE) concluyó el domingo un escrutinio extraordinario de los votos tras las denuncias opositoras y siguió dando ventaja a Hernández. Sin embargo, sigue sin proclamar el ganador oficial de los comicios.

La Misión de Observación Electoral de la Organización de los Estados Americanos (OEA) denunció ""irregularidades, errores y problemas sistémicos"" en el proceso electoral, que sumados al ""estrecho margen de los resultados"", ""no permiten tener certeza sobre los resultados"".

Durante el recuento, se desataron enfrentamientos violentos en los que murieron una docena de personas y las autoridades decretaron un estricto toque de queda en todo el país.

El sistema de Naciones Unidas en Honduras pidió a los candidatos que llamen a la calma a sus seguidores y que, ejerciendo sus respectivos liderazgos, “generen el necesario espacio de diálogo”.

En la reunión de tres días, los Estados miembros de la ONU, la sociedad civil y otras partes interesadas definirán conjuntamente una visión para el Pacto, revisarán los resultados y las recomendaciones recopiladas durante la fase de consultas que se realizó entre abril y noviembre de este año.

El encuentro es copresidido por México y Suiza, quienes se desempeñarán como co-facilitadores del proceso del Pacto Mundial.

**Una oportunidad para reorientar la narrativa tóxica contra los migrantes**

Durante la inauguración, la Representante Especial del Secretario General de la ONU para la Migración Internacional, Louise Arbour, recordó en su mensaje de que la reunión en Puerto Vallarta tiene lugar después de cinco sesiones de discusión a nivel nacional y regional, con los gobiernos y las organizaciones de la sociedad civil.

El Pacto Global para la Migración, destacó, “es una oportunidad para reorientar la narrativa – a menudo tóxica- contra las personas migrantes hacia una narrativa más precisa que reconozca el apoyo extraordinariamente positivo y está preparado para dirigirse a los cambios en una manera seria y realista”.

“Las necesidades de las decisiones políticas deben ser tomadas con base en hechos, no en percepciones, ficciones y mitos”, aseveró Arbour, quien preside el encuentro también en calidad de Secretaria General de la Conferencia Intergubernamental.

Los cambios en las estructuras de las poblaciones, el cambio climático, los cambios en la naturaleza de los trabajos, así como otros factores económicos, junto con la realización de aspiraciones fundamentales de las personas, afirmó Arbour, hacen que el fenómeno de la migración se esta extendiendo.

La única manera de abordar el reto del siglo XXI sobre la migración masiva es mediante una respuesta coherente por la comunidad internacional, recalcó Arbour.

“La migración demanda una respuesta global. El movimiento de las personas a través de fronteras es, por definición, una realidad internacional”, dijo.

**Ningún país pueda enfrentar el fenómeno migratorio por si mismo**

En su discurso de inauguración, el Secretario de Relaciones Exteriores de México, Luis Videgaray lamentó la salida de Estados Unidos de la negociación del Pacto Global, anunciada por el Presidente estadounidense este sábado.

“Ningún país por más grande y poderoso que sea puede enfrentar el fenómeno migratorio por si mismo”, declaró.

Y destacó que “se pierde una oportunidad de trabajar juntos en favor de un fenómeno que nos atañe a todos.”

El Pacto Mundial para Migración debe ser ampliamente respaldado y centrado en los derechos humanos

“Nuestra habilidad para un mejor manejo de la movilidad humana descansa en que el Pacto Global sea tan sólido como sea posible: ampliamente respaldado y centrado en los derechos humanos, con las necesidades de los más vulnerables firmemente en su corazón”, concluyó la Representante Especial del Secretario General para la Migración Internacional.

El Pacto Global para las Migraciones establecerá una serie de principios, compromisos y entendimientos entre los Estados Miembros con respecto a la migración internacional en todas sus dimensiones.

Está basado en la adopción de la Declaración de Nueva York para Refugiados y Migrantes el 13 de septiembre de 2016, los 193 países miembros de la ONU reconocieron la necesidad de un abordaje integral a la movilidad humana y de fortalecer la cooperación a nivel global mediante la creación de mecanismos que protejan a las poblaciones migrantes.

El cambio climático representa el desafío más determinante de la época en que vivimos, pero contamos con aliados importantes para combatirlo: la ciencia y la tecnología, dijo António Guterres.

El titular de la ONU destacó que el progreso tecnológico ya ha puesto de manifiesto la falsedad de que la respuesta al cambio climático supone una amenaza para la economía y subrayó los beneficios de invertir en la economía verde.

El costo de la energía renovable está cayendo en picado y un número cada vez mayor de ciudades adopta medidas y establece objetivos medioambientales ambiciosos, puso como ejemplo Guterres.

Además, instó a los gobiernos a realizar una mayor inversión en el Fondo Verde para el Clima.

Guterres destacó que los países en desarrollo no son responsables del problema al que se enfrentan y, por lo tanto, es de justicia que los países desarrollados les ayuden.

En materia de búsqueda, la Comisión valora positivamente la implementación de la tecnología LIDAR en la búsqueda de los estudiantes, así como el inicio de las búsquedas en campo de las áreas marcadas a través del uso de esta tecnología. La Comisión reconoce los esfuerzos para hacer una base de datos de fosas en el estado de Guerrero, cuya consolidación aún queda pendiente.

En materia de investigación, la CIDH saluda que se hayan recabado en el expediente indicios claros de que existieron varias rutas de desaparición y al menos dos grupos diferentes de estudiantes, tras su detención, lo que impone la profundización de determinadas líneas de investigación. Asimismo, reconoce el trabajo de investigación en telefonía y balística, que posibilitó concluir la participación de una nueva corporación policial en los hechos. La CIDH insta al Estado a ubicar a varios actores cuya detención es fundamental para el esclarecimiento de los hechos. Adicionalmente, la Comisión señala la importancia de consignar policías de diferentes instituciones involucrados en los hechos.

Según la información recibida, está pendiente por esclarecer cómo 9 teléfonos de los jóvenes que tuvieron actividad tras los hechos, pasaron de las manos de los estudiantes a las de quienes los detentaron en último término. Como señaló la CIDH anteriormente, estos hechos aunados a otros elementos de prueba  corrobora la necesidad de descartar la versión inicial que indicaba que todos los teléfonos habían sido quemados en el basurero de Cocula. Adicionalmente, aún no se establece plenamente la identidad de actores claves al momento de los hechos.

En materia de atención a víctimas, la CIDH saluda la presentación del Diagnóstico de Impactos Psicosociales y en Salud, el cual marca la ruta para la atención a víctimas, y en los casos de heridos y muertos, para eventuales reparaciones. La Comisión llama al Estado a tomar acciones concretas para asegurar el cumplimiento de lo estipulado en dicho diagnóstico, particularmente en lo relativo a los heridos sobrevivientes, a los familiares de los jóvenes ejecutados y los familiares de los jóvenes desaparecidos, siempre en coordinación y acuerdo con las víctimas, familiares y representantes.

Durante la visita, los miembros del Mecanismo se reunieron con representantes del Estado, los familiares de los estudiantes desaparecidos y sus representantes con el fin tras cumplirse del plan de trabajo presentado en noviembre de 2016. En este sentido, el Estado mexicano manifestó su compromiso de respaldar el seguimiento de la CIDH a las medidas cautelares durante todo el año de 2018, mediante una contribución financiera voluntaria que se efectuará en valor integral en diciembre de 2017. Adicionalmente, en el primer período de sesiones de la CIDH de 2018, las partes analizarán y en su caso acordarán, programar nuevas visitas y reuniones de trabajo del Mecanismo Especial de Seguimiento.

El Estado se comprometió adicionalmente a atender los asuntos pendientes identificados por la CIDH, y a recibir a la delegación del Mecanismo en una visita oficial adicional en febrero de 2018, que permita evaluar resultados en materia de investigación, búsqueda y atención a víctimas. Adicionalmente, la Procuraduría General de la República se comprometió a continuar trabajando y sosteniendo reuniones de seguimiento con los familiares y sus representantes de forma periódica.

En el marco de la visita, la delegación sostuvo reuniones con altos funcionarios del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, la Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) y la Secretaría de Gobernación. También sostuvo una reunión con la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos.

La CIDH es un órgano principal y autónomo de la Organización de los Estados Americanos (OEA), cuyo mandato surge de la Carta de la OEA y de la Convención Americana sobre Derechos Humanos. La Comisión Interamericana tiene el mandato de promover la observancia y la defensa de los derechos humanos en la región y actúa como órgano consultivo de la OEA en la materia. La CIDH está integrada por siete miembros independientes que son elegidos por la Asamblea General de la OEA a título personal, y no representan sus países de origen o residencia.",269,"Spanish"
2371629,"Alcaldes, gobernadores y autoridades étnicas firmaron el Pacto por la no violencia contra la niñez **Bogotá, D. C., 12 de diciembre 2017**. Alcaldes y autoridades étnicas, entre indígenas y afrocolombianas, firmaron el Pacto por la no violencia contra la niñez, como parte de la estrategia Territorios Amigos de la Niñez (TAN), de la cual además se hizo pública la imagen oficial.

El evento se realizó hoy 12 de diciembre y contó con la participación de la Directora General del ICBF, Karen Abudinen; el Director del Sistema Nacional de Bienestar Familiar (SNBF), Pedro Quijano; el Representante de UNICEF Colombia, Roberto De Bernardi, y la Directora de Save the Children Colombia, María Paula Martínez, además de cerca de 200 representantes de diferentes instancias de gobierno y organizaciones de la sociedad civil.

Se trata de un acto simbólico donde las autoridades territoriales del país se proponen “unir esfuerzos y voluntades para eliminar todas las formas de violencia contra niñas, niños y adolescentes, en el marco de la estrategia Territorios Amigos de la Niñez (TAN)”, dice el documento, en el que además se plantean compromisos específicos para mejorar la articulación interinstitucional, capacitar a funcionarios, abrir espacios de participación para niños, niñas y adolescentes, y fortalecer la corresponsabilidad con la familia, la empresa privada, las escuelas y la comunidad como garantes de los derechos y la felicidad de la niñez de todos los rincones del país.

Luis Enrique Mena, Alcalde de Ríosucio (Chocó) afirmó que “para nosotros es muy importante este Pacto porque estamos pensando primero que todo en la niñez. La idea es aprovechar para que cambiemos los círculos de violencia que durante años han afectado a nuestros municipios y a nuestras familias, de forma que no se repitan con nuestros niños y niñas. Ahora el siguiente paso será articular con el departamento y la Nación porque esto no se puede quedar en el papel”.

En el Pacto, las autoridades étnicas y los gobiernos territoriales afirman que “no solo seremos veedores de la garantía de los derechos de niños, niñas y adolescentes, sino que jamás ejerceremos violencias contra ellos, ni permitiremos que otros lo hagan. El silencio es cómplice y los gobiernos territoriales sumamos nuestra voluntad para evitarlo y renunciamos a las excusas, a los pretextos y a la indiferencia”.

Ante lo cual la Directora General del ICBF, Karen Abudinen, manifestó que “vamos a trabajar por los niños y niñas porque cada día 67 menores de edad sufren maltrato. No podemos permitir que esto siga ocurriendo y la única manera es involucrando a los padres de familia y sobretodo incidiendo en las políticas públicas y sociales para que nuestros niños tengan bienestar. En este sentido, la firma de este Pacto resulta fundamental para impulsar la corresponsabilidad entre familia, sociedad, escuelas y Estado”.

Un Territorio Amigo de la Niñez es aquel donde todos y cada uno de los niños, niñas y adolescentes son queridos, cuidados y protegidos por la familia, la comunidad y el Estado, quienes los reconocen como el centro de sus prioridades, para garantizar su pleno desarrollo y felicidad. En palabras de Ángela Isabel Vivas, quien tiene 12 años y vive en Suárez (Cauca), “un Territorio Amigo de la Niñez es un lugar nos toman en cuenta para participar, donde nos cumplan nuestros derechos y además podamos vivir sin violencia y con paz, tranquilidad y libertad”.

Según el Representante de UNICEF Colombia los Territorios Amigos de la Niñez (TAN) son aquellos “que protegen integralmente a la niñez haciendo efectivos sus derechos, y deben no solo conocer, planear y gestionar adecuadamente soluciones estructurales que afecten positivamente el desarrollo los niños, niñas y adolescentes, sino que además deben gestionar los riesgos que puedan afectarlos o excluirlos, en conjunto con los distintos actores de la comunidad”.

Por su parte, la Directora de Save the Children Colombia, María Paula Martínez, concluyó que lo “más importante de este Pacto es que tiene carácter territorial y que lo hemos firmado con los gobiernos municipales y las autoridades étnicas de las comunidades más vulnerables y donde la niñez corre mayor peligro. El gran reto ahora será hacer un ejercicio de monitoreo, seguimiento t acompañamiento para que los compromisos del Pacto impacten positivamente sobre cada niño, niña y adolescente del país”.

La estrategia de Territorios Amigos de la Niñez, inspirada en el modelo global de UNICEF llamado Ciudades Amigas de la Infancia, es posible gracias al Convenio para el Fortalecimiento al Sistema Nacional de Bienestar Familiar (SNBF), implementado entre el Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF), el Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia (UNICEF) y Save the Children Colombia, con la participación de la Comisión Intersectorial para la Primera Infancia (CIPI).",269,"Spanish"

2371539,"Ecuador y Venezuela: experto en Derechos Humanos exige mayor cooperación con las NU GINEBRA (12 de diciembre de 2017) – El progreso en el sector social en Venezuela y Ecuador, compatible con el Pacto relativo a los Derechos Económicos, Sociales y Culturales, debe conocerse y ser reconocido de forma más general, declaró un experto en derechos humanos de las NU.

En este contexto, la integración regional y la cooperación con los organismos internacionales se deben fortalecer a fin de asegurar que los programas sociales sean continuos y mejores, dijo Alfred de Zayas, experto independiente en la promoción de un orden internacional democrático y equitativo, luego de una misión oficial para estudiar los programas de gobierno de ambos países que fomentan el progreso social y mejoran los estándares de vida, en especial de los más vulnerables en la sociedad.

Sin embargo, el progreso social va de la mano con los derechos civiles y políticos, y no debe lograrse a expensas de las libertades civiles, añadió.       

“Priorizar el desarrollo humano es una estrategia del gobierno que tiene una historia fuerte en la región”, apuntó el Experto al finalizar la misión de dos semanas.

“Las iniciativas de ambos países para reducir el analfabetismo, garantizar la educación gratuita, ampliar la asistencia médica, proporcionar viviendas asequibles, crear empleos y eliminar la discriminación son dignas de elogio.

“Por otro lado, también estoy consciente de los problemas endémicos que persisten o han empeorado en la región, incluyendo pobreza, corrupción, escasez de ciertos alimentos y medicinas, fallas en garantizar el consentimiento libre, previo e informado en el sector extractivo, inflación, distribución ineficiente, insuficiente separación de poderes, irregularidades electorales y represión del disenso”.

“Asimismo, las condiciones externas, incluyendo la fuga de fondos nacionales a paraísos fiscales, incursiones foráneas dentro del espacio normativo de los gobiernos, medidas coercitivas unilaterales y contraproducentes, contrabando de alimentos y medicinas, y la falta de asistencia legal mutua cuando los recursos públicos son desviados de manera ilícita, constituyen graves obstáculos para el cumplimiento de las obligaciones de derechos humanos, no solo los económicos y sociales, sino también los civiles y políticos”, dijo el experto.      

Reconociendo que las causas básicas de la situación actual eran variadas e interconectadas, el señor de Zayas recomendó que el gobierno de Venezuela ejerza más flexibilidad en sus políticas monetarias, desarrolle la capacidad técnica en la administración pública y publique, con frecuencia, los datos acerca de la situación nutricional, epidemiológica, inflacionaria y presupuestaria.

En Ecuador, el Experto propuso que el gobierno fortalezca los programas contra la corrupción, establezca un impuesto sobre las transacciones financieras y amplíe la prohibición de evasión de impuestos a fin de incluir a los particulares y empresas privadas. 

Además de exigir el fortalecimiento de las iniciativas nacionales, el señor de Zayas exhortó a incrementar la solidaridad internacional con los pueblos de Venezuela y Ecuador, la entrada y distribución irrestrictas de alimentos y medicinas con el objetivo de promocionar los derechos civiles, culturales, económicos, políticos y sociales.  

El Experto alentó a ambos gobiernos a aceptar la asesoría y la ayuda ofrecida por la Oficina de Derechos Humanos de las UN, el PNUD, la OMS, la OIT, la UNICEF, la ONUSIDA y la FAO. 
  
Durante su visita, el Experto independiente se reunió con cientos de personas, incluyendo funcionarios gubernamentales, miembros de los grupos opositores, académicos, economistas, líderes religiosos, organizaciones que representan a las mujeres, comunidades indígenas y sectores marginados de la sociedad, periodistas, miembros de la sociedad civil y representantes de organizaciones regionales y del sector privado. También se reunió con administradores y beneficiarios de los programas sociales.  

El señor de Zayas, cuya visita tuvo lugar del 26 de noviembre al 9 de diciembre de 2017, agradeció a ambos gobiernos por hacer el esfuerzo de responder sus preguntas y proporcionar documentación y estadísticas. En sus recomendaciones preliminares a Venezuela, solicitó una serie de acciones urgentes incluyendo la liberación de personas detenidas.

Un informe acerca de su misión, del primer país que visita desde el mandato fue elaborado en 2010, será presentado ante el Consejo de Derechos Humanos en 2018.

CIEGO DE AVILA.— El Contingente Juvenil Ernesto Che Guevara, integrado inicialmente por 100 estudiantes de la Universidad Máximo Gómez Báez, se encuentra en las comunidades de Punta Alegre y Máximo Gómez en apoyo a la recuperación de viviendas, en una de las zonas más afectadas de la provincia tras el paso del huracán Irma.

Maykel Pérez Váldez, primer secretario del Comité Provincial de la Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas, explicó que la creación de este grupo parte de una propuesta de la organización juvenil durante las labores que conmemoraron en esos poblados el Aniversario 50 del primer trabajo voluntario convocado por el Che en Cuba.

«En el contingente participarán jóvenes de todos los sectores, quienes irán rotando semanalmente; pero en esta ocasión, para iniciar, fueron los miembros de la Federación Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU) los primeros que dieron el paso al frente y con ellos vamos a iniciar las labores », señaló Maykel.

Roberto Cruz Santisteban, presidente de la FEU en la casa de altos estudios avileña, explicó que los muchachos pernoctarán en casas de campañas o en hogares de los pobladores que brinden esa facilidad.

Su tarea principal, añadió, será vincularse en la construcción o reparación de viviendas; sin embargo, también realizarán actividades culturales en las comunidades o centros de evacuación con el movimiento de artistas aficionados.

Y no es para menos porque las huellas del ciclón aún se aprecian. Si bien en toda Ciego de Ávila se dañaron 31 540 viviendas, en el Consejo Popular Máximo Gómez —donde se encuentra la zona de Punta Alegre— se afectaron  1 542 casas, lo que representa el 66 por ciento de su fondo habitacional, y de ellas 778 se derrumbaron por completo, mientras 224 perdieron todo el techo en la noche durante la cual Irma pasó su ojo por la zona en esa área del norte del municipio de Chambas.",269,"Spanish"

**Flash Update No. 1 – Emergencia por inundaciones en municipios de Antioquia y Chocó**

Desde el 03 de diciembre, al menos 30.260 personas (+6.000 familias) han resultado damnificadas por graves inundaciones presentadas en dos municipios de Antioquia y cuatro de Chocó, como consecuencia de las intensas lluvias propias de la temporada.  

**En Antioquia** el desbordamiento de los ríos Atrato, Arquía y Murrí causó inundaciones en los municipios de Vigía del Fuerte y Murindó, dejando un saldo aproximado de 10.400 personas (2.080 familias) damnificadas en zona rural y urbana. Declaran la calamidad pública ante el desborde de capacidades.  

En Vigía del Fuerte se afectó casi la totalidad del territorio a excepción de una vereda. Se necesita con urgencia alimentos, colchonetas y kits de aseo. En Murindó2 la afectación se dio en la cabecera municipal, la vereda Bella Luz y los corregimientos Tobadó y Campo Alegre. Las necesidades más urgentes están en materia de frazadas y alimentos para albergues; se evacuó la estación de Policía por riesgo de colapso de esta estructura y las viviendas vecinas.  

**En Chocó,** la creciente súbita de los ríos Atrato y Jiguamiandó causaron inundaciones en viviendas y cultivos afectando a más de 3.500 familias (+19.000 personas), tanto en las cabeceras municipales como algunas zonas rurales de los municipios de Carmen del Darién, Bojayá, Medio Atrato y Riosucio, según información del Consejo Departamental para la Gestión de Riesgos y Desastres (CDGRD). En Carmen del Darién al menos 1.200 familias se encuentran damnificadas. Desde el 19 de noviembre dos instituciones educativas prestaron servicio interrumpido de clases en al menos 1.309 menores (713 niños y 596 niñas), quienes tendrán que recuperar las actividades escolares en enero de 2018.

2371389,"El número de familias separadas a raíz de conflictos, violencia o desastres naturales se mantiene alto desde hace cinco años, dice el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja Ginebra – El número de familias separadas a raíz de conflictos, violencia y desastres naturales se ha mantenido alto en los últimos cinco años, según datos del Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja (CICR). Los nuevos casos de personas que se han puesto en contacto con la Institución para intentar reunirse con familiares han aumentado en casi un noventa por ciento en este periodo (2012-2016). En efecto, se tramitaron 18.000 nuevos casos solo en el último año.

Sin embargo, el CICR advierte que esta es solo la punta del iceberg, ya que la falta de datos precisos significa que el número de familias separadas sería mucho más alto. La advertencia coincide con el lanzamiento de una nueva campaña de Navidad preparada por la Institución: [un desgarrador vídeo de 1:31 minutos de duración](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEefiJ7oQxE) refleja la angustia que atraviesan las familias separadas.

Con imágenes reconstruidas tomadas de circuitos de televisión cerrados, el vídeo muestra lugares familiares, como un centro comercial atestado de gente y un zoológico,para dar cuenta del pánico de madres, padres y abuelos que por un momento pierden de vista a sus niños, y de sus desesperados esfuerzos por encontrarlos. Esta separación temporaria se pone en contraste con los años de separación que sufren miles de familias en todo el mundo, junto con algunas imágenes conmovedoras de reuniones de familiares facilitadas por el CICR.

La Institución incita al público a difundir el vídeo para sensibilizar sobre la cuestión y conseguir donaciones para apoyar la labor vital que realiza a fin de reunir a familiares en esta época tan especial, y todos los demás días del año también.

""El dolor de perder a un hijo es la peor pesadilla que sufre todo padre, pero para las familias afectadas por conflictos, violencia o desastres naturales es una cruda realidad que puede durar años.

Los conflictos son cada vez más prolongados, y el mundo es testigo del mayor movimiento de personas desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Por estos factores, el riesgo de que las familias queden separadas es cada vez mayor"", dijo Matt Clancy, vocero del CICR.

""Las actividades destinadas a reunir a familiares separados son tan importantes para la misión humanitaria como las que se realizan para proporcionar alimentos, refugio o agua. Se trata de devolver la dignidad a las personas, de volver a conectarlas con sus seres queridos. Además, en situaciones de conflicto armado, la reunión de familiares es un derecho consagrado por el derecho internacional.""

El CICR se esfuerza por revertir esta situación y ayudar a reunir a familiares separados. A lo largo de más de un centenar de años, el CICR y sus asociados del Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja en todo el mundo han trabajado para reunir a familias separadas. Lo han logrado, según cada caso, mediante una carta, una llamada telefónica o una reunión como las que muestra el vídeo.

Esto se logró a través de las siguientes estrategias:

- En los 11 bancos de leche humana se recolectaron 2 mil 600 litros de leche humana, y fueron distribuidos dos mil litros que beneficiaron a 4 mil 300 recién nacidos prematuros y de bajo peso.

- Se cuenta con 10 hospitales certificados como Amigos de la Lactancia Materna. A los que se suman 10 más que se encuentran en proceso para ser certificados, así como dos maternidades cantonales más.

- El 92% de hospitales ya implementan el Paquete Integrado, el cual promueve el apego piel a piel entre madre y su recién nacido, así como la ligadura del cordón umbilical, el cual consiste en ligar el cordón cuando deja de pulsar. Este método previene la anemia en los niños entre 6 a 11 meses de edad, así como la hemorragia intraventricular en recién nacidos prematuros.

“El objetivo de la Política de Nutrición Pediátrica Hospitalaria es contribuir a la prevención y disminución de la mortalidad neonatal, infantil y la desnutrición aguda y crónica, a través de garantizar una atención integral médico-nutricional con calidad y equidad”, expresó el doctor Francisco Chew, coordinador de la Unidad de Promoción y Desarrollo de Hospitales del MSPAS.

Por esa razón, mi país se ha sumado desde el principio al liderazgo de Francia y del Presidente Emmanuel Macron en favor del cuidado de nuestro medio ambiente.

El Acuerdo de París constituye la base del entendimiento global y define las acciones colectivas para enfrentar el grave desafío climático. Hoy, algunos cuestionan su pertinencia, incluso la necesidad de actuar. Los mexicanos sabemos que el cambio climático es una realidad y estamos convencidos de la necesidad de intervenir de inmediato. No podemos postergar nuestras acciones porque, quizá, seremos la última generación de mujeres y hombres que tenga en sus manos la oportunidad de detener el calentamiento del planeta.

Si queremos concretar este esfuerzo, es indispensable encontrar nuevas fuentes de financiamiento, en particular para los países en desarrollo, que deben transformar sus modos de producción y buscar métodos alternativos de generación de energía. Este será el tema principal de las conversaciones que nos reúnen nuevamente en París, donde dialogaremos sobre iniciativas y mecanismos para reunir recursos financieros contra el cambio climático, como el establecimiento de un precio al carbono.

En México, estamos creando un Mercado de Carbono que operará muy pronto desde la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, en el que participarán cerca de 500 industrias y donde se asignará un precio a aproximadamente 400 millones de toneladas de CO2e. Por otra parte, estamos convencidos de que es posible construir un mercado regional en América del Norte ­─con nuestros socios en California, Quebec y Ontario─ y trabajamos con países de Latinoamérica para impulsar esquemas de transferencia de bonos de carbono.

Adicionalmente, hemos instrumentado reformas en materia energética y hacendaria que impulsan la inversión en energías alternativas y que serán la base para eliminar los subsidios a los combustibles fósiles. Por ejemplo, creamos los Certificados de Energías Limpias, que permiten a los grandes consumidores cumplir con la obligación de usar en sus procesos de producción un mínimo de 5% de energía proveniente de fuentes limpias.

México es altamente vulnerable a los efectos del cambio climático. Tan sólo en dos meses, recibimos el impacto de tres huracanes y tres tormentas tropicales, atípicos por su magnitud y su frecuencia. De igual forma, en los últimos años, nuestros vecinos del Caribe han sufrido estragos sin precedentes a causa de estos fenómenos meteorológicos.

Conscientes de nuestra vulnerabilidad, hemos realizado acciones en materia de adaptación basada en ecosistemas, protección de la biodiversidad, gestión integral del agua y conectividad entre Áreas Naturales Protegidas a nivel nacional. Y con los países del Caribe, hemos implementado medias para prepararnos mejor ante el riesgo de desastres naturales.

El cambio climático es una batalla urgente que sólo se ganará si actuamos de manera colectiva. Es una responsabilidad global que debe contar con el compromiso de todos. La postura de México es firme: implementar el Acuerdo de París para asegurar a las futuras generaciones un porvenir más limpio, sano y en equilibrio con el medio ambiente. Lo hacemos con la convicción de que es nuestra obligación, porque nuestro planeta es la casa de todos.",269,"Spanish"
2371224,"El seguro cubre millonarias afectaciones por Irma **En 200 millones en moneda libremente convertible se estiman los montos que deberá cubrir Seguros Internacionales de Cuba**

En 200 millones en moneda libremente convertible se estiman los montos que deberá cubrir Seguros Internacionales de Cuba, S.A. (Esicuba), como consecuencia de las pérdidas ocasionadas a sus clientes por el huracán Irma.

Según Alejandro Ramos Fernández, director de la Unidad Empresarial de Ventas de Negocios Especiales de Esicuba, esa entidad continúa tasando dichas pérdidas.

«Irma ha sido el evento de mayor magnitud atendido por Esicuba durante sus casi 55 años de fundada. El meteoro azotó las principales plantas turísticas e industriales del país donde tenemos grandes cúmulos asegurados», explicó.

Los especialistas de la principal aseguradora del sector empresarial en Cuba han trabajado desde septiembre para cuantificar los daños; sin embargo, se efectuaron, adelantados, pagos a cuentas de más de 30 millones de cuc, para que comenzara de forma inmediata la rehabilitación de los sectores más afectados.

Ramos Fernández apuntó que la pronta recuperación de las instalaciones turísticas tiene que ver también con la capacidad para cubrir los contratos con que ha respondido Esicuba, fundamentalmente cuando comienza la temporada alta de visitantes y son imprescindibles polos como los ubicados en la cayería norte o Varadero.

Aseguró que se espera indemnizar la totalidad registrada durante el primer trimestre de 2018. «La recuperación empresarial luego de los grandes volúmenes pagados también será uno de los retos para el próximo año», puntualizó.

Eliana Domínguez Oropesa, directora de Desarrollo y Mercadotecnia de Esicuba, destacó la capacidad de la aseguradora para cubrir afectaciones importantes en un corto período y con reservas de capital propias, lo que también reafirma su correcto funcionamiento y el compromiso que defiende: asegurar el patrimonio estatal cubano en cualquier lugar del mundo y los intereses de los inversionistas que llegan a la Isla, contribuyendo así al desarrollo de la economía nacional.     

Esicuba cuenta hoy con más de 800 clientes, entre los que destacan los relacionados con el comercio exterior cubano, la aeronáutica civil, las telecomunicaciones, el sector del turismo, los productores y comercializadores de medicamentos y los inversores extranjeros en el país.",269,"Spanish"
